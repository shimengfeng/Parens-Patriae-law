[{"case_name":"William Bartlet and Others versus James King Executor","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2051940\/","date":"1815-11-01","court":"Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court","content":"Dewey, J.\nThe action is for a legacy given by the will of Mary Morris, deceased, to the plaintiffs, in trust for The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, for the purpose of promoting the pious objects of said board. The proceedings are according to the course of the common law, and the action is given by statute.\nThe clause of the will, on which the action is founded, is in the words following ; [here his Honor recited the words of the bequest ; and added the substance of the agreement of the parties to the action, and proceeded.]\nAs there is no objection to the competency of the plaintiffs to take, and the words of the will are sufficient to vest the legacy legally in them ; they are entitled to retain their verdict, unless the bequest is void for some of the reasons suggested by the counsel for the defendant.\nThe objections are, 1. That it is against public policy. 2. That it is void for uncertainty, as to the object of the legacy, and of the persons who were intended to be the cestui que trust. 3. That a trust in this Commonwealth is ineffectual, there being no court to compel the execution of it. And, 4. That, as a bequest for pious and charitable uses, it is void by the provincial act of 28 Geo. 2, which enacts, that all such bequests or devises, which shall not be * made before the last sickness of the person making [ * 540 ] the same, or at least three months before the death of the testator, shall be utterly void and of no effect.\nWhether the avails of this legacy might be more beneficially employed for similar purposes in our own country than in foreign parts, is not a point for us to decide. The testatrix, in the disposition of her property, had a right to direct the manner in which it should be applied ; and, if not inconsistent with the rules of law, her intention must be executed. In applying it to the purposes mentioned in the will, her intention was certainly humane and benevolent. The propagation of the Christian religion, whether among our own citizens or the people of any other nation, is an object of the highest concern, and cannot be opposed to any general rule of law, or principle of public policy.\nThe second point made by the defendant\u2019s counsel is, that the be quest is void for uncertainty. This is the principal question in the cause, and it has been fully and ingeniously argued by the counsel on both sides ; and a great variety of cases have been cited, which bear upon the point.\nWithout undertaking to comment on the numerous authorities referred to, I shall give the opinion of the Court, as to what clearly appears to be the result of them, as applicable to this part of the case.\nIt is very manifest that the legacy is not given to the plaintiffs for their own use and benefit, but in trust for the use of others ; and it is said, on the part of the defendant, that the trust, or the persons who are entitled to the benefit of it, as cestui que trust, are altogether uncertain. If this be so, the bequest is undoubtedly void ; for it was not the intention of the testatrix that the plaintiffs should hold it for their own use.\nIt then becomes necessary to inquire, who are the persons to whose use the plaintiffs claim the legacy under the will of the testatrix ? They are not described by their proper names, nor by the [*541] name of any corporate body ; but they * are called \u201c The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and their Associates.\u201d The persons who, at the time of executing the will, constituted that board and their associates, if they can be ascertained, are the persons for whose use the legacy was intended ; not for their personal or individual benefit, but as trustees to apply the proceeds of it to the purposes of the board, and to promote the pious objects for which it was established.\nIt is not necessary that a legatee be named in the will. If he is otherwise clearly described, it is sufficient. Cases of this sort very frequently occur ; as, where a legacy is given to the children of a particular person, or to the wife, or to any other relative who is clearly designated ; and in various other instances, where a description of the person is substituted for the name. If the persons, who constituted \u201c The American Board of Foreign Missions,\u201d are certain, and known by that description, we then have as much certainty with regard to the persons to whom the plaintiffs are to pay over the interest and income of the legacy, as if they had been expressly named in the will. For this, we must recur to the facts agreed by the parties ; and by them it is admitted that such a board, consisting of nine persons, was in being, and known to the testatrix at the time of making her will; and that the members of the board are annually chosen by the general association of Congregational ministers in Massachusetts proper.\nBut, as the members of the board are elected annually, it is still said that they are uncertain, and incompetent to take under this bequest ; and that it is also uncertain who were intended by the word associates; that it must either include all the ministers of the various associations in Massachusetts, or the delegates to the association ; either of which will be too vague and uncertain.\nThe first part of this objection is answered by a recurrence to the words of the will. The persons who then, at the time of making the will, constituted the board, are the persons designated to receive the income of the legacy ; * and any subsequent [*542 J change of the members of the board cannot affect the validity of the bequest. We do not see any propriety in giving to the word associates the meaning which the defendant\u2019s counsel has affixed to it; nor do we think that the testatrix intended it should be so understood. It is difficult to find, in the manner in which it is here used, that it has any meaning ; and, if it has not, or is absurd, or repugnant to the clear intention of the testatrix manifested in other parts of the will, it may be rejected as surplusage. At most, it is only an inaccuracy in the description of the persons, who are, nevertheless, sufficiently certain ; and which does not go to defeat the legacy. Rejecting, then, the word associates, as mere surplusage, and considering the members of the board of commissioners, at the time of making the will, as the persons intended by the testatrix, all difficulty with respect to the uncertainty of the persons who stand in the relation of cestui que trust of the plaintiffs is removed.\nAs the Board of Commissioners do not, however, take the legacy to their own personal use and benefit, but are to apply the income of it to charitable and pious uses ; it is said, in the argument, that they are not to be considered as the cestui que trust, who are still more uncertain ; they being the various persons in foreign countries, who, it was intended, should receive the benefit of the religious instruction furnished by the bounty of the testatrix.\nIn donations to trustees for the support of schools, or other charitable purposes, it does not seem to be necessary that there should be any particular or certain persons designated, who were strictly cestui que trust in the common use of the term. By the will, in this case. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions are made to stand in that relation to the plaintiffs. They are to receive the income of the legacy, and apply it to the pious and charitable purposes of the board, in furnishing the means of religious instruction, according to the rules of their association. In trusts of this nature, the individuals who are ultimately to be benefited are * always uncertain. All the certainty required is, a [*543] general description or limitation, not a particular description of the individuals. On this ground, therefore, we do not perceive any more difficulty in giving effect to the bequest, than exists in all cases of donations to charitable uses ; whether given to trustees directly, or in trust for other trustees, to be expended in promoting the objects for which they are given.\nThe object of this bequest is, to promote the knowledge of Christianity among the heathen in foreign countries, by sending out missionaries to preach to them and instruct them. The ultimate object of the bequest, and the persons for whose benefit it was intended, are not more indefinite than they are in a great number of cases to be found in the books, in which the trusts have been adjudged to be good. A bequest in trust for the advancement of the Christian religion among the infidels in North America, a trust for the benefit of poor clergymen, to a lying-in hospital, to the poor inhabitants of St. Leonard, to poor Dissenting ministers in any county. In all these, and many other similar cases, it has been determined that the trusts were effectual and valid.\nIn the case of Thelusson vs. Woodford, it is said that the Court is bound to carry the will into effect, if they can see a general intention consistent with the rules of law, even if the particular mode or manner pointed out by the testator is illegal. Powell, in his treatise on Devises [page 421], says that a devise is never construed absolutely void for uncertainty, but from necessity; if it be possible to reduce it to a certainty, the devise is good. And he cites the case of Ongley vs. Peale, in support of the position. In the case of Christ\u2019s Church College, Cambridge, it is adopted as a principle, on which that case was determined, that the- Court of Chancery will aid a defective conveyance to legal charitable uses.\nOn these grounds we are satisfied that there is not so much uncertainty, as to the persons who are to take this legacy [*544] *as the cestui que trust of the plaintiffs, or as to the ultimate object of the bequest, as to render the bequest on that account void. But, according to the principles adopted in the English courts, we are clearly of opinion that the trust is well created by the will, and that it is valid and effectual.\nBut it is further contended on the part of the defendant, that such a bequest must be void in this Commonwealth, because we have no court of chancery, to enforce the execution of a trust.\nWe do not think it necessary for the Court, in this case, to inquire what is the remedy, or whether there be any, in case the trustees should be unfaithful in the discharge of their trust. This legacy is given to the plaintiffs on the special trust and confidence expressed it? the bequest; and confiding in their integrity, that they will dispose of the proceeds of it according to the directions of the testatrix, and in pursuance of her pious and benevolent intentions. They are persons competent to take as legatees ; and the legacy is legally vested in them. It is not for a court of law to devest a legal estate, because there may be, at some future time, a failure in the execution of an equitable trust, for which it is uncertain whether there be any adequate remedy.\nIn the argument, many instances were referred to by the counsel for the plaintiffs, in which the legislature of the Commonwealth, by granting acts of incorporation, has lent its aid to carry into more effectual execution trusts designed for charitable uses, and for other objects beneficial to the public ; and.it was contended on the part of the plaintiffs, that the legislature, in some cases of that description, may lawfully exercise the powers of a court of chancery.\nBut it is unnecessary to give any opinion as to the legal effects of such legislative acts ; as the decision of this case will not be affected by any consideration of that question. It has undoubtedly been a practice, as well under the colonial charters as since the adoption of the present Constitution, for the legislature to create corporations, and to invest * them with certain powers, to [*545] enable them better to manage donations to charitable and other public uses. And as such trusts in England are under the particular care of the King, as parens patriae, and are regulated by the chancellor, who is called the keeper of the King\u2019s conscience ; in the absence of a court of chancery in this Commonwealth, there seems to be good reason for the legislature to give such beneficial aid to charitable trusts, when it does not interfere with the just and equitable rights of individuals.\nIt is also contended for the defendant, that this legacy is within the provincial statute of 28 Geo. 2, commonly called the statute of mortmain, and therefore void.\nBut we think this objection cannot prevail. All the provisions and restrictions contained in that act manifestly related to gifts and devises, made to such bodies politic as were created by the act itself; which were Episcopal and other Protestant churches Donations or bequests to any other persons or corporate bodies cannot, by any reasonable construction, be brought within the meaning of the act.\nIt is not, however-, very material now to settle the construction of that statute ; as we are fully satisfied that it is virtually repealed by the subsequent statute of 1785, c. 51. A subsequent statute, revising the whole subject-matter of a former one, and evidently intended as a substitute for it, although it contains no express words to that effect, must, on the principles of law as well as in reason and common sense, operate to repeal the former ; according to the case of The King vs. Cator, in which it was decided that a former statute, inflicting a penalty of \u00a3100, and three months\u2019 imprisonment, on persons enticing away artificers, was virtually repealed by a subsequent statute, inflicting \u00a3500. penalty, and twelve months\u2019 imprisonment for the same - offence. The same principle was adopted in the case of The King vs. Davis. All the subject-matter of the act of 28 Geo. 2 is contained in the statute of 1785. A part only of its restrictions and limitations, in the second section, is omitted in the latter ; and it is very obvious, by comparing [*546] them, *that the legislature considered the latter as a complete substitute and repeal of the former.\nIt being clearly the opinion of those members of the Court who sit in this cause, that none of the objections, which- have been made, are sufficient to defeat the bequest to the plaintiffs ; according to the agreement of the parties, judgment is to be entered according to the verdict.\n(1)\n2 Bro.

Hart\u2019s Executors","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4686\/","date":"1819-02-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\ndelivered the opinion \u00a9f the Court. .\nIt was obviously the intention of the testator, that the Association should take in its character as an Association j and should, in that character, perform the trust created by the will* The membei's composing it must be perpetually changing ; but, however they might change, it is \u201c The Baptist Association that.' for ordinary meets at Philadelphia annually,\u201d which is to take and manage the \u201c perpetual fund\u20195 intend-e(j be Created by this will. This Association is described with sufficient accuracy to be clearly understood ; but, not being incorporated, is incapable of taking this trust as a society. Can the bequest be taken by the individuals who composed the Association at the death of the testator ?\nThe Court is decidedly of opinion that it cannot, No private advantage is intended for them. Nothing* was intended to pass to them but the trust; and that they are not authorized to execute as individuals. It is the Association for ever, not. the individuals, who, at the time of his death, might compose the Association, and their representatives, who are to manage this \u201c perpetual fund.\u201d\n\u2022 At the death of the. testator, then, there were no persons in existence who were capable of taking this bequest.. Does the subsequent incorporation of the .Association give it this capacity ?\nThe rules of law compel the Court to answer this 1 <lu8st*\u00b0n in the negative\u00bb The bequest was intended f\u00b0r a society which was. hot at the time, and.might never be, capabl\u00e9 \u00f3f faking it. According to law, it is gone for ever. The legacy is void; and the property vests, if not otherwise disposed of by the will, In the next of kin. A body. corporate after-wards created, had it even fitted the description of the will, cannot devest this interest, and claim it for their corporation.\nThere being no persons who can claim the right to execute this trust, are there any who, upon the general principles of equity, can entitle themselves to its benefits ? Are there any to whom this legacy, were it not a charity, could be decreed ?\nThis question will not admit of discussion. Those for whose ultimate benefit the legacy was intended, 0 J 7 are to be designated and selected by the trustees. It could not be intended for the education of all the youths of the Baptist denomination who were designed for the ministry; nor for those who were the dependents of his father, unless, in the opinion the trustees, they should appear promising. These trustees being incapable of executing this trust, or even of taking it on themselves, the selection can never be made, nor the persons designated who might take beneficially.\nThough this question be answered in the negative, > . A , 0 7 we must still inquire, whether the character of this legacy, as a charity, will entitle it to the protection of this Court P\nThat such a leg\u00e1cy would be sustained in England, . , , -r, . . . , \u201e , \u2019 is admitted. But, it is contended for the executors, ' 7 that it would be sustained in virtue of the statute of the 43d of Elizabeth, or of the prerogative of the crown, or of both ; and not in virtue of those rules by which a Court of Equity, exercising its ordinary powers, is governed. Should these propositions be true, it is farther contended, that the statute of Elizabeth does not extend to the case, and that the equitable-jurisdiction of the Courts of the Union does not extend to cases not within the ordinary powers of a Court of Equity. '\nOn the part of the plaintiffs, it is contended, that the peculiar law of charities, does not originate in the statute of Elizabeth. Had lands been conveyed in trust, previous to the statute, for such purposes as are expressed in this will, the devise, if is said, would have been good at law; and, of consequence, a Court of Chancery would have enforced the trust in virtue of its general powers. In support of this, proposition, it has been said, that the statute of Eliz\u00e1beth does noteven profess to give any validity to devises or legacies, of any description,- not before good, but only furnishes a new and more convenient mode for discovering and enforcing them ; and that the royal, prerogative applies to those cases only Where the objects of the trust are entirely indefinite; as. a bequest generally to charity, or to the poor.\nIt is certainly true, that the statute does not, in terms, profess to give validity to 'bequests acknowledged not before to have been valid.; It is also true, that it seems to proceed on the idea that the trusts it is intended to enforce, ought, in conscience,' independent of th\u00e9 statute, to be carried into execution. It'is, however, not to- be denied, that if, at the time, no -remedy existed in any of the cases described, the-statute gives :one: A brief analysis of the act will support this proposition.\nIt authorizes the Chancellor to appoint commissioners to inquire of all gifts, &c. recited in the act, of the abuses, &c. of such gifts, &c.; and upon such inquiry to make such order as that the articles given, &c. may be duly and faithfully employed, to and for the charitable uses and intents, before, rehearsed respectively, for which they were given, &c. The statute then proceeds, \u201c which orders, judgments, and decrees, not being contrary or repugnant to the orders, statutes, or decrees, of the donors, or founders, shall, by the authority of this present parliament, stand firm and good according to the-tenor and purport thereof, and shall be executed accordr ingly, until the same shall be undone or altered ,by the Lord Chancellor of England,\u201d &c.\nSubsequent sections of the act direct these decrees, &c. to be certified to the Chancellor, who is to take such order for their execution as to him shall seem proper ; and, also, give to any person aggrieved the right to apply to Chancery for redress.\nIt is not to be denied, that if any gifts are enumerated in this statute, which were not previously valid, , , . - or for which no previous remedy existed, the statute \u201e . , \u2019 \u2019 makes them valid, and furnishes a remedy.\nThat there were such gifts, and that the statute has given them validity, has been repeatedly determined. The books are full of cases,, where conveyances to charitable uses, which were void by the statute of mortmain, or were, in other respects, so defective, that, on general principles, nothing passed, have been, sustained under this statute. If this statute restores to its original capacity, a conveyance rendered void by an act of the legislature, it will, of course, operate with equal effect on any legal objection to the gift which originates in any other manner, and which a statute can remove..\nThe authorities to this point are numerous. In the case of the Attorney General, on behalf \u00f3f St. John\u2019s College in Cambridge v. Platt, the name of the cor-' Porate body was not fully expressed. This case was referred by the Chancellor to the judges, who certifred, that though, according to the general principles of law, the devise was void ; yet it was good under the statute of Elizabeth. This case is also reported in Cases in Chancery, 267.. where it is said, the judges certified the devise to be void at law, but the Chancellor decreed it good under the statute.\nSo, in Chancery Cases, 134. it was decided, that a bequest to the parish of Great Creaton was good under the statute. Though this case was not fully nor clearly reported,, enough appears to show that this bequest was sustained only under the statute }of Elizabeth. The objections to it were, that it was void on general principles, the parish not being incorporated ; and that it would not be decreed under the statute, the proceedings not being before commission\u2022ers, but by. original bill. The Master of the'Rolls ordered precedents to be produced ; and, on finding One in which four judges had certified that.a party might, under the statute, proceed in chancery by original bill, he directed the legacy to be paid. Could this bequest have been sustained on doctrines applicable to charities independent of the statute, no ques-^ tion could have arisen concerning the rights to proceed by original bill. -\nIn Collison\u2019s case, the will made John TBruet and others, \u201c feoffees of a home, to keep it in reparation, and to bestow the rest of the profits on reparation of certain highways.\u201d On a reference by the Chancellor, the judges declared, that \u201c this case was.within the relief of the 43d of Elizabeth ; for, though the devise were utterly void, yet it was within the words limited and appointed for charitable uses.\u201d\nIn these cases, it is expressly decided, that the bequests are void, independent of the statute, and good under it. It furnishes no inconsiderable additional argument, that many of the gifts recited in the 43 Eliz., would not, in themselves, be considered as charitable; yet they are all governed by the same rule. No dictum has been found indicating an opinion that the statute has no other effect, than to enable the Chancellor to inquire, by commission-, into cases before cognizable in his Court by original bill. It may, then, with confidence be stated, that whatever doubts may exist in other points which have been made in the cause, there is none in this : The statute of the 43d of Eliz. certainly gave validity to somei devises to charitable uses, which Were not valid, independent of that statute. Whether this legacy be of that description, is a question of more difficulty,\nThe objection is, that the trust is void; and the description of the cestui que trust so vague, that no pferson can be found whose interest can be sustained.\nI he counsel for the plaintiff insists, that cases equally vague have been sustained in Courts of common law, before the statute; and would, a fortiori, have been sustained in Courts of equity. . He relies on Porter\u2019s case, and on Plowden, 522.\nPorter\u2019s case is this: Nicholas Gibson, in the 32d Hen. VIII., devised a wharf and house to his wife, upon condition that she should, on advice of learn-. 1 1 ed counsel, in all convenient speed after his decease, assure, give, and grant the said lands and tenements, for the maintenance, for ever, of a free school the testator had erected, and' of alms men and alms women attached to it The wife entered into the property, and, instead of performing the condition, conveyed it, in the 3d of Edw. VI., by a lease for forty years. Afterwards, in the 34th of Eliz., the heir at law entered for a condition broken, and conveyed to the queen. On the validity of this entry and conveyance the cause depended.\nOn the part of Porter, who claimed under the lease, it was contended, that the use was against the act of the 22d of Hen. VIII. c. 10. and, therefore, void, on which the estate of the wife became absolute.\nOn the part of the queen, it was argued, 1st. That the statute of Hen. VIII. avoided superstitious, and not charitable uses. But if it extended to this, still, that it made the use, and not the conveyance, void. The devisee, there being no consideration, would stand seized to the use of the heir. 2d. That in case the devise is to the wife, on condition that she would, by the advice of learned counsel, assure his lands for the maintenance of the said free-\u00e1chool, and alms men and alms women; this might be done lawfully, by procuring the king\u2019s letters patent incorporating them, and, afterwards, a letter of license to. assure the lands to them\nUpon these reasons the Court was of opinion, that the condition was broken, and that the entry of the heir was lawful. .\nIn this case no question arose concerning the possibility of enforcing, the execution of the trust. It was not forbidden by law; and, therefore, the trustee might execute it, \u00d3n failing so to do, the condition on which the estate was, given was broken, and the heir might enter; but it is not suggested that the cestui que trust had any remedy. An estate may be granted on any condition which is not against law, as that the grantee shall go to Rome; and for breach of that condition, the heir may enter, but there are no means of compelling the journey to Rome. In the argument of Porter\u2019s case, the only mode sugg\u00e9sted for assuring to the school the benefit intended, is by an act of incorporation, and a letter of license.\nIn considering this case, it seems impossible to resist the conviction, that Chancery could, then, afford no remedy to the cestui que trust. It is not probable that those claiming the beneficial interest would have waited, without an effort, from the 32d of Hen, VIII. when the testator died, or, at any rate from the 3d of Edw. VI., when the condition was conclusively broken by the execution of the lease, until the 34th of Eliz., and then have resorted to the circuitous mode of making an arrangement with the heir, at law, and procuring a conveyance from him to the queen, on whose will the charity would still depend, if a plain \u00e1nd certain remedy had existed, by a di-' rect application to the Chancellor.\nIf, as there is much reason to believe, from this, and from many other cases of the same character which were decided at law anterior to the statute of Eliz., the remedy in Chancery-was not then afforded, it would go far in deciding the present question; it would give much countenance to the opinion, that the original interference of Chancery in charities., where the cestui que trust had not a vested equitable interest which might be asserted in a Court of Equity, was founded on that statute, and still depends on it.\nThese cases, and the idea they suggest, that at the time Chancery afforded \u00a1 no remedy for the aggrieved, account for the passage of the statute of the 43d of Elizabeth, and for its language, more satisfactorily than any other cause which can be assigned.\n- If, as has been contended, charitable trusts,' however vague, could then, as flow, \u25a0 have been enforced in Chancery, why pass an act to enable the ^Chancellor to appoint commissioners to inquire concerning them, and to make orders for their due execution, which orders were to be revised, \"established, altered, or sef aside, by him ? If the Chancellor could accomplish this, and was in the practice of. accomplishing it in virtue of the acknowledged powers and duties of his office, to what, purpose pass the act ? Those who, might suppose themselves interested in these donations, would be the persons to bring the case before the commissioners; and the same persons would have brought it before the Chancellor, had the law afforded them the means of doing so. The idea, that the commissioners were substituted for the Court as the means of obtaining intelligence not otherwise attainable, or of removing inconveniences in prosecuting claims by original bill which had been found so great as to obstruct the course, of justice, is not war\u2019* ranted by the language of the act, and is disproved by the efforts which were soon made, and which soon prevailed, to proceed by way of original.\nThe statute recites, that whereas lands, money,. &c. had been heretofore given, &c.,some for the relief of aged, impotent, and poor people, &c. which lands, &c. \u201c nevertheless, have not been employed according to the charitable intent of the givers and founders thereof, by reason of\u201d \u2014 what ? of the difficulty of discovering that such trusts had been created ? or of the. expensiveness and inconvenience of the existing remedy'? No. \u201c By reason of frauds, breaches of trust, and negligence in those that should pay, deliver, and employ the same.\u201d That is by reason of fraud, breach of trust, and negligence of the trustees. The statute then proceeds to give a remedy for these frauds, breaches of trust, and negligences, Their existence was known when the act passed, and was the motive for passing it. No negligence or fraud is charged on the Court, its officers*, or the objects of the charity; only on the trustees. Had there been an existing remedy for their frauds and negligences, they could npt, when known, have escaped that remedy.\n: There seem to have been two motives, and they were adequate motives, for enacting this statute: The first, and greatest, was to give a direct remedy to. the party aggrieved, who, where the trust was vague, had no certain and safe remedy for the injury sustained ; who might have been completely defeated by any compromise between the heir pf. the feoffor and the trustee; and who had no means of comPelIinS ^ heir to perform the trust, should he enter for the condition broken. The second, to remove the doubts' which existed, whether these charitable donations were included within the previous prohibitory statutes.\nWe have no trace, in any book, of an attempt in the Court of Chancery, at any lime anterior to the statute, to enforce one of these vague bequests to charitable uses. \u2022 If we have no.reports of the decisions in Chancery at that early period, we have reports of decisions at common law, which. notice points referred by the Chancellor to the judges. Immediately after the passage^ of the statute, we. find, that questions, on the validity of wills containing charitable bequests, were propounded to, qnd decided by, the law judges. Collison\u2019s case Was decided in the 15th of James I., only seventeen years after the passage of the act, and the devise was declared to be void at law, but good under the statute. Two years prior to this, Griffith Flood\u2019s case, reported in Hobart, was propounded by the Court of Wards to the judges ; and, in that case too, it was decided, that the will was void at law, but good under the statute. Had the Court of Chancery taken cognizance before the statute, of devises and bequests to charitable uses, which were void at law, similar questions must have arisen, and would have been referred to the Courts of law, whose decisions oq them would be found in the old reporters. Had it been settled before the statute, that such, devises were good, because the use was charitable, these questions could not have arisen aiterwards ; or, had they arisen, would have been differently treated.\nAlthough the earliest decisions we have, trace the peculiar law of charities to the statute of Elizabeth, and although nothing is to be found in our books to justify the opinion, that Courts of Chancery, in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, sustained, anterior to that statute, bequests for charitable uses, . . . i ' which would have been void on principles applicable x x 1 * to other trusts, there are some modern dicta in cases respecting prerogative, and where , the proceedings' are on the part of the king, acting as parens patriae, which have been much relied on at the bar, and , ought not to be overlooked by the Court.\nIn 2 Peere Will. 119. the Chancellor says, \u201c In like manner, in the case of charity, the king, pro bono publico, has an original right to superintend the care thereof; so that, abstracted from the statute of Elizabeth relating to charitable uses, and antecedent to it, as well as since, it has been every day\u2019s practice to file, informations in chancery, in the Attorney General\u2019s name, for the establishment of charities.\u201d\n\u201c This original right\u201d of the crown, \u201c to superintend the care\u201d of charities, is no more than that right of visitation, which is an acknowledged branch of the prerogative, and is certainly not given by statute. The practice of filing an information in the name of the Attorney General, if, indeed, such a practice existed in those early times, might very well. grow out of this prerogative, and W'ould by no means prove, that, prior to the statute, the law respecting charities was what it has been since. These words were uttered for the purpose of illustrating original power of the crown over the persons and estates of infants, not with a-view to any legal distinction between a legacy to charitable and other objects.\nLord Keeper Henly, in 1 Sir Win. Blackstone\u2019s Reports, 91., says, \u201c I take the uniform rule of this Court before, at, and after the statute of Elizabeth, to have been, that where the uses are charitable, and the person has in himself full power to convey, the Court will aid a defective conveyance, to such uses. Thus, the devises to corporations were void under the statute of Hen. VIII. ; yet they were always considered as good in equity, if given to charitable uses.\u201d\nWe think we cannot be mistaken when we say, that no case was decided between the statute of mortmain, passed in the reign of Hen. VIII., and the statute of Elizabeth, in which a devise to a corporation was held good. Such a decision would have overturned principles uniformly acknowledged in that Court. The cases of devises, in mortmain, which have been held good, were decided since the statute of Elizabeth, on the principle, that the latter statute repeals the former so far as relates to charities. The statute of Geo. II. has been uniformly construed to repeal, in part, the statute of Elizabeth, and charitable devises comprehended in that act have, ever since its passage, been declared void. On the same reason, similar devises must, subsequent to the. statute of Henry VIII. and anterior to that of Elizabeth, have been also declared void. It is remarka fele that, in this very-case, the Lord Keeper declares one of the charities to be void, because it is contrary to the statute of mortmain, passed in the reign of Geo. II. AH the respect we entertain for the Reporter of this case, cannot prevent the opinion, that the words of the Lord Keeper have been inaccurately reported. If not, they were inconsiderately uttered.\nThe principles decided in this case are worthy of_ attention: \u201c Two questions,\u201d says the report, \u201c arose, 1st. Whether this was a conveyance to charitable uses under the statute of Elizabeth, and therefore, to be aided 1?y this court. 2d. Whether it fell within the purview of the statute of mortmain, 9th of Geo. II. and was therefore a void disposition.\u201d\nIt is not even suggested that the defect of the conveyance could be remedied otherwise than by the statute of Elizabeth. The Lord Keeper says, \u00a3t the. conveyance of the 22d of June, 1721, is admitted to be defective, the use being limited to certain officers of the corporation, and not to the corporate body; and therefore there is a want of. persons to take in perpetual succession.\u201d (The very defect in the conveyance under the consideration of this court.) \u00a3\u00a3 The only doubt,\u201d continues the Lord Keeper, \u00a3\u00a3 is, whether the Court should supply this defect, for the benefit of the charity, under the statute of Elizabeth.\u201d\nIt is impossible, we think, to understand this declaration, otherwise than as an express admission, that a conveyance to officers, who compose the corporate body, instead of the corporate body itself, or in other words, a conveyance to any persons not incorporated to take in succession, although for charitable purposes, would be void if not supported by the statute of Elizabeth.\nAfter declaring the conveyance to be good, the Lord Keeper proceeds; \u201cThe conveyance, therefore, being established under the statute of Elizabeth, we are next to consider how it is affected under the stature of the 9th of Geo. II.\u201d\nThe whole opinion of the Judge, in this case, turns upon the statute of Elizabeth. He expressly declares the conveyance to be sustained by that statute, and in terms admits it to be defective without its aid. The dictum, therefore, that before that statute, courts were in the habit of aiding defective conveyances to charitable uses, either contradicts his whole opinion on the point before him, or is misreported. The probability is, that the Judge applied this dictum to cases which occurred, not to cases which were decided before the statute. This application of it would be supported by the authorities, and would accord with his whole opinion in the case.\nIn the case of the Attorney General v. Bowyer, the Chancellor, speaking of a case which occurred before the passage of the statute of wills, says, \u201c It does not appear that this Court, at that period, had cognizance upon information for the establishment of charities. Prior to the time of Lord Ellesmere, as far as tradition in times immediately following goes, there were no such informations as this on which I am now sitting, but they made out the case as well as they could by law.\u201d\nWithout attempting to reconcile these seemingly contradictory dicta, the court will proceed to inquire J \u2019 r 1 whether charities, where no legal interest is vested, and which are too vague to be claimed by those for whom the beneficial interest was intended, could be established by a court of equity, either exercising its ordinary jurisdiction, or enforcing the prerogative of the-King as parens patrice, before the 43d of Elizabeth.\n..The general principle, that a vague legacy, the object. of which is indefinite, cannot be established in a court of equity, is admitted. It follows, that he who contends that charities formed originally an exception to the rule, must prove the proposition. There being no reported cases on the point anterior to the statute ; recourse is had to elementary writers, or to the opinions given by judges of modern times.\nNp elementary writers sustain this exception as a part of the law of England. It may be considered as a part of the civil code, on which our proceedings in chancery are said to be founded; but that code is not otherwise a part of the law of England than as it has been adopted and incorporated by a long course of decisions. The whole doctrine of the civil law, respecting charities, has certainly not been adopted. For example: by the civil law, a legacy to a charity, if there be a deficiency of assets, does not abate;' by the English law, it does abate. It' is, not, therefore, enough to show that, by the civil law,- this legacy wo\u00fcld be valid. It is necessary to go farther, and to show, that this principle of the civil law has been.eff- grafted into the jurisprudence of England, and been transplanted into the United States.\nIn White v: White, the testator had given a legacy to the Lying-in Hospital which his executor should appoint, and afterwards struck out the name of the executor. The legacy was established, and it was referred to a Master to say to which Lying-in Hospital it. should be paid. In giving this opinion, Lord Thur-low said, \u201c the cases have proceeded upon notions adopted from the Romain and civil law, which are very favourable to charities, that legacies given to public uses'not'ascertained, shall be applied to some proper object.\u201d\nThese expressions-apply, perhaps exclusively, to that class of cases in which legacies given to one charity have, since the statute of Elizabeth, been applied to another; or, in which legacies given so vaguely as that the object cannot be precisely defined., have been applied by the crown, or by the Court, acting in behalf of the crown, to some charitable object of the same kind. White v. White was itself a case of that description ; and the words \u201c legacies-given to public uses not ascertained,\u201d \u201c applied to some proper object,\u201d seem to justify this construction. If this be correct, the sentiment advanced by Lord Thurlow, would amount to nothing more than that the cases in which this extended construction was given to the statute of Elizabeth proceed upon notions adopted from the Roman and civil law.\nBut if Lord Thurlow used this language under the impression that- the whole doctrine of the English Chancery, relative to charities, was derived from the civil law, it will not be denied that his opinions, even when not on the very point decided, are entitled to great respect. Something like the same idea escaped Lord Eldon in the case of Moggridge v. Thackwell. Yet upon.other occasions, different opinions have been advanced, with an explicitness which supports the idea, that the Court of Chancery in England does not understand these dicta as they have been understood by the counsel for the plaintiff. In the case of Morrice v. The Bishop of Durham, where the devise was to the Bishop, in trust, to dispose of the residue \u201c to such objects of benevolence and liberality as he, in his own discretion, should most approve,\u201d the bequest was determined to be void, and the legacy decreed to the next of kin. The-Master of the Rolls said, \u201c In this court, the signification of charity is derived principally from the statute of Elizabeth. Those purposes are considered charitable\u00bf which that statute enumerates, or which, by analogies, are deemed within its spirit and intendment.\u201d This case afterwards came before the Chancellor, who affirmed the decree, and said, \u201c I say with the Master of the Rolls, a case has not yet been decided, in which the court has executed a charitable purpose, unless the will contains a description of that which the law acknowledges to be a charitable purpose, or devotes the property to purposes of charity in general.\u2019\nThe reference made by the Chancellor to the words of the Master of the Rolls, whose language he adopts, proves that he uses the term \u201claw\u201d as synonymous with \u201cthe statute of Elizabeth.\u201d\nAfterwards, in the same case, speaking of a devise to charity generally, the Chancellor says, \u201cit is the duty of the trustees, or of the crown, to apply the money to charity, in the sense which the determinations have affixed to the word in this Court: viz. either such charitable purposes as are expressed in the statute, or to purposes analogous to those.\u201d\nHe adds, \u201c charitable purposes, as used in this Court, have been ascribed to many acts described in that statute, and analpgous to those, not because they can with propriety be called charitable, but as that denomination is, by the statute, given to all the purposes described.\u201d.\nIt has been also said that a devise to a charity generally is good, because the statute of Elizabeth uses that term.\nThese quotations show that Lord Eldon, whatever may have been the inclination of his mind when he determined the case of Moggridge v. .Thackwell, was, on more mature consideration, decidedly of opinion, that the doctrines of the Court of Chancery, peculiar to charities, originated not in the civil law, but in the statute of Elizabeth. This opinion is entitled to the more respect, because it was given after an idea, which might be supposed to conflict with it, had been insinuated by Lord Thurlow, and in some degree followed by himself; it was given in a case which required aft investigation of the question; it was given, too, without any allusi\u00f3n to the dicta uttered by Lord Thurlow and himself; a circumstance which would scarcely have occurred, had he understood those dicta as advancing opinions he was then denying. It . \u2022 \u00b0 f . \u00b6 . . a . js the more to be respected, because it is sustained by all the decisions which took place, and all the opinions expressed by the judges soon after the passing of the statute of Elizabeth. In 1 Ch. Cas. 134. a devise to the Parish of Great Creaton, the Parish not being a corporation, was held to be void independent of the statute, but good under it. So, in the same book, p. 267. on a devise to a corporation which was misnamed, the Lord Keeper decreed the charity un\u00bb der the statute, though before the statute no such devise could have been sustained. The same point is decreed in the same book, p. 195. and in many other of the early cases. These decisions are totally incompatible with the idea that the principles on which they turned were derived from the civil law.\nThere can be no doubt that the power of the crown to superintend and enforce charities existed in very early times; and there is much difficulty in marking the extent of this branch of the royal prerogative before the statute. That it is a branch of the prerogative, and not a part of the ordinary power of the Chancellor, is sufficiently certain. Blackstone, in v. 3. p. 47. closes a long enumeration of the extraordinary powers of the Chancellor, with saying, \u201cHe is the general guardian of all infants, idiots, lunatics; and has the general superintendance of all charitable uses in the kingdom *, and all this over and above the vast and extensive jurisdiction which he exercises in his judicial capacity in the Court of Cliaucery.\" In the same volume, p. 487. he says, \u201c the king, as parens palrice, has the general superintendance of all charities, which he exercises by the keeper of his conscience, the Chancellor; and, therefore, whenever it is necessary, the attorney general, at the relation of some informant, files, ex officio, an information in the Court of Chancery, to have the charity properly established.\u201d\nThe author of \u201cA Treatise of Equity\u201d says, \u201cso, anciently, in this realm, there were several things that belonged to the king as parens patrice, and fell under the care and direction of this Court: as, charities, infants, idiots, lunatics, &c.\u201d Cooper, in his chapter on the jurisdiction of the Court, says, \u201c the jurisdiction, however, in the three cases of infants, idiots or lunatics, and charities, does not belong to the Court of Chancery as a court of equity, but as administering the prerogative and duties of the crown.\u201d\nIt would be waste of time to multiply authorities to this point, because the principle is familiar to the profession. It is impossible to look into the subject, without perceiving and admitting it. Its extent may be less obvious.\nWe now find this prerogative employed in enforcing donations to charitable uses, which would not be valid if made to other uses; in applying them to different objects thafi those designated by the donor; and in supplying all defects in the instrument by which the donation is conveyed, or in that by which it is administered.\nIt is not to be admitted that legacies not valid in themselves, can be made sosby force of prerogative, in violation of private rights. This superintending power of the crown, therefore, over charities, must be confined to those which are valid in law. If, before the statute of Elizabeth, legacies like that under consideration would have been established, on information filed in the name of the Attorney General, it would furnish a strong argument for the opinion, that, some principle was recognised prior to that statute, which gave validity to such legacies.\nBut although w7e find dicta of Judges, asserting, that it was usual before the statute of Elizabeth, to establish charities, by means of an information filed by the Attorney General; we find no dictum, that charities could be established on such information, where the conveyance was defective, or the donation was so vaguely expressed, that the donee, if not a charity, would be incapable of taking; and the thing given would vest in the heir or next of kin. All the cases which have been cited, where charities have been established, under the statute, that were deemed invalid independent of it, contradict this position.\nIn construing that statute, in a preceding part of this opinion, it was shown, that its enactments are sufficient to establish charities not previously valid. It affords, then, a broad foundation for the superstructure which has been erected on it.' And, although many of the cases go, perhaps, too far; yet, on a review of the authorities, we think they are to be considered as constructions of the statute not entirely to be justified, rather than as proving the existence of some other principle concealed in a dark and remote antiquity, and giving a rule in cases of charity which forms an exception to the general principles of our law.\n, But even if in England the power of the king as parens patria would, independent of the statute, extend to a case of this description, the inquiiy would M \u00ab , . . , \u25a0 still remain now lar this principle would govern in the courts of the United States. Into this inquiry, A 4\/7 however, it is unnecessary to enter, because it can arise only where the\u2019 Attorney-General is made a ___. _ party.\nThe Court has taken, perhaps, a more extensive view of this subject, than the particular case, and the question propounded on it, might be thought to require. Those who are to take this legacy beneficially, are n\u00f3t-before the Court, unless they are represented by the surviving members of the Baptist Association, or by the present corporation. It was, perhaps, sufficient to show, that they are not represented by either. This being the case, it may be impossible that a party plaintiff can be made to sue the executor, otherwise than on the information of the Attorney General. No person exists who can assert any interest in himself. The cestui que trust can be brought into being only by the selection of those who are named in the will to take the legacy iii trust, and those who are so named, are incapable of taking it. It is, perhaps, decisive of the question propounded to this Court to say, that the plaintiffs cannot take. But the rights of those who claim the beneficial interest, have been argued at great length, and with great ability ; and there would have been some difficulty in explaining satisfactorily, the reasons why the plaintiffs cannot take, without discussing also, the rights of those for whom they claim. The Court has, therefore, - indicated its opinion on the whole case, as argued and understood at the bar.\nCertificate. This cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record of the Court of the United States, for the Fifth Circuit, and the District of Virginia, and on the question therein stated,' on which the Judges, of that Court were divided in opinion, and which was adjourned to this'Court, and was argued by counsel: On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that the plaintiffs are incapable of taking the legacy for which this suit- was instituted ; which opinion is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit Court.\na\nFinch, 221.\nb\nHob. 136.\na\n1 Co.

But this very circumstance admonishes a judge to be cautious in every step lie tabes \u2014 to recollect that his office is to administer the law as he finds it, am! not as lie wishes it to be, and to arm himself with new resolution in \u00e1 case, so peculiarly calculated to enlist the judgment on the side of the affections.\nThe subject too, is in a great measure rrew in our Courts, and is acknowledged to be entangled with difficulties even in the country whence we derive our legal notions ; so that it is not easy from the multitude of conflicting decisions, to extract the true principle on which the case- ought to be placed.\nThe bill is filed to attain an account and division of the real and personal estate of Moses Griffin, and to have his executors declared trustees for the Complainants, who are the heirs at law and next of kin of the testator. The bill is demurred to $ and the argument has involved many in* foresting and important topics, towards the illustration of which,' numerous authorities have been adduced and commented on.\nThe principal objections to the will are, that it tends to produce a perpetuity$ that the objects of the trust are vague and indefinite j and that as it is discretionary with the executors whether they will fulfil the trusts or not, there is no one to call them to account. Hence it is alleged, that the property ought to be given to the next of kin and the heirs.\nIt is deemed material to remark, in the first place, that the executors do not seek the aid of the Court, at present, to establish the charity, whatever they may do in future : but this application is made by the heirs and next of kin to defeat the will \u2014 so that, if the trust be valid at law, and the objects of it sufficiently certain, it seems superfluous to enquire into the powers of the Court, in relation to charitable devises and bequestsj for if it were conceded that a Court of Chancery in this State is invested with no such jurisdiction over such subjects, yet if the disposition of the will is valid at law, the demurrer must be sustained, and the executors left to manage the fund in such way as the ]aw prescribes and under such protection as it affords. If the trust were unlawful, the Court would decree the property to the Complainants, as in the case of Craven\u2019s will: jf j|. j)(J ]axvf\u201ei an(] sufficiently definite to be carried into execution, it cannot be subverted in this Court.\nThere is no principle of Law which forbids the appropriation of property to charitable uses, since the power of alienation was introduced. A devise to individual trustees, by name, for any pus-pose, not made unlawful by the .statutes of Mortmain, has ever been deemed valid since the statute of wills, independent of the 43d Eliz.. The Civil Law was distinguished for the protection it afftmled to such bequests$ and the first decisions under the statute of wills were probably influenced by a like disposition in the Courts. To maintain a charity expressly declared by the testator, seems to follow naturally from the former power of the Ordinary to apply a part of every man\u2019s personal estate to charity. In Porter\u2019s case, the devise was to the wife, on condition that she should grant the lands for the maintenance forever of a free school, w'hich the testator had erected, and of alms-men and alms-women attached to it. By those who argued in support of the devise, one reason given was, that the statute of Hen. VIII. avoids superstitious and not charitable uses. Another was, that if it extended to this, it made the use, and not the conveyance, void. And the devise was sustained by the Court. The condition was held to be a lawful one, and such as the trustee \u00a1night execute. It was because the condition was not performed, that the heir was permitted to enter. This case is commented on by the Chief-Justice of the United States in the Baptist Association V. Hart\u2019s executors, and it is taken for granted, that the trust was a lawful one, and might have been performed.\nIn enumerating the trusts not executed by the statute of uses, Sanders puts this case \u2014 If a man .enfeoff two or three persons and their heirs in trust, and to the intent that the inhabitants of such a place should hiive a free school, or in trust to maintain poor children, this trust is not executed by the statute of 27 Hen. VIII, for the land must remain in the trustees to answer the purposes of the trust, and, therefore, not a use executed by the statute. One reason for this construction is, because a use cannot be limited to a parish or any indefinite multitude, by a general name, it being'no corporation, and without any public allowance. But this limitation of ttie use is good as a trust. Another reason, because it is a rule in Chancery, that where lands are given to trustees in trust to pay the profits over, the lands must continue in the trustee, in order to perform the trust.\nThese two instances of valid trusts at law, where the objects of the trusts arc not more certain, and in the last case, less so, than in that before us, shew that the will is sustainable at Law.\nIn the case before cited from Wheaton\u2019s Reports, the bequest was to the Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia annually, for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination ; and it was held that the association, not being incorporated at the testator\u2019s death, could not take the trust as a society. The Chief-Justice observes, \u201c The cestui que trust can be brought into being \u201c only by the selection of those who are named in the will \u201c to take the legacy in trust; and those who are named are incapable- of taking it.\u201d In the case before us, on the contrary, the executors are capable of taking the estate in trust, and are therefore capable of selecting those who are to be benefited by it. If then the widow in Porter\u2019s case might lawfully grant the land for the maintenance forever of the free school and of alms-meh and alms-women i and the feoffees in the case from Sanders might law fully provide a-free school or maintain poor children, I cannot perceive any reason why the executors in this cas# may not purchase land, erect a school, and select the poor children to be educated and bound out. The trust may be carried into complet\u00e9 execution by an act of incorporation, as was suggested in Porter\u2019s case; and by the same means also the objection may be obviated that there is no person to call the executors to account. This inconvenience, however, arises from the act of the testator himself, who may fairly be presumed to have known where he might safely confide so large a trust; and, as he might have given the property absolutely to the executors, no reason is perceived why he might not invest them with discretionary powers for so beneficent an end.\nIt is true, that a Court of Equity assumes a control over trusts in general, and if the objects be uncertain, will consider the property undisposed of for the benefit of the heirs and next of kin. But here the objects are distinct, viz. the education of poor children and the binding them out as apprentices. As all the poor children in that part of the country could not receive the benefit of the fund, a discretion was necessarily confided to the executors to select such as stood most in need of that aid. Without so much discretion as this, no charitable institution could ever have been established ; for though it might be possible for a testator to designate existing objects, how could he point out those hereafter to be admitted.\nThe devises and bequests are next objected to on the ground that they tend to a perpetuity. The meaning which the Law annexes to this term, is that of an estate tail so settled that it cannot be undone or made void. As when, if all the parties who have interest, join, they cannot bar or pass the estate ; but if by the concurrence of all having the estate tail, it may be barred, it is not a perpetuity. It is in reference to estates tail, that the word is used in the Bill of Rights \u2022 for there was no other estate that had a tendency that way. A condition not to alien. annexed to a fee simple, is void j and the rules relative to executory devises, by which their duration is limited, had' effectually checked their tendency to a perpetuity. In obedience to the declaration of the Bill of Rights, and to the injunction in the Constitution, the Legislature of 1784 abolished entails \u2014 giving as a reason that they tended to raise the wealth and importance of particular families, and to give them an undue influence in a republic. This shews plainly that they designed to prevent the accumulation of individual wealth, and did not contemplate the possibility of any evil likely to arise, from the establishment of a permanent fund for charitable uses. The probable effect of this was the reverse of what they meant to guard against, as it promised to increase the equality of the republic. It would afford the means of instruction to those who could not otherwise procure them ; it would diffuse knowledge and morality amongst that class of society which stands most in need of them, and, by rendering them useful and efficient members, add to the strength and happiness of community. Assuredly, then, property applied to these ends never entered into the Common Law notion of a perpetuity : otherwise the objection would have been taken in Porter\u2019s case, and the many others to be found in the books where similar dispositions have been made. The Common Law has always been adverse to perpetuities, and it is acknowledged on all hands that exe-cutory devises, on account of their tendency that way, are not the legitimate offspring of it, but a privilege gradually insinuated into its system. The opposition to mortmain did not arise from the mischiefs likely to ensue from the stagnation of property, but from the loss occasioned to the Barons, of the profits of their tenure. It is true, that one of the. last mortmain acts in England recites this as an evil; but that proves that it was not an inherent objection to such dispositions in point of Law, otherwise they would not ha\\ e subsisted for so long a period. I am thus led to conclude, that a perpetuity which the Law would deem void, must be an estate so settled for private uses that by the very terms of its creation there is no pot estas aliena,nili in the owner. There is no such restraint imposed upon ^lese execut0rs. They, like other trustees, may sell for a valuable consideration ; but whether the purchaser can acquire such a title as will prevail against the cestui que trust, will depend upon his having notice \u2014 an incidental circumstance wholly independent of the right of selling.\n\u2022 The next enquiry is, whether a Court of Equity in this State lias jurisdiction of the subject. At the period of the first settlement of this State, then a Colony, the Chancery in England was in tiie regular exercise of jurisdiction over charities, under tiie 43d Elizabeth. A similar Court wfts established here by tiie Lords'Proprietors, under the general powers given them by the Charter, it was held by the Governor and Council, and continued until the year 1777, when tiie separation from tiie mother country took place. The foi\u00a1owing year, the Legislature declared all sucii parts of tiie Common Law to be in force, as were heretofore in force and use within this territory, or so much as is not inconsistent with the independence of the State. Under a similar provision in the laws of New-Tork, Chancellor Kent thought the Equity system was of course included. From the Revolution to the year 1782, there, was a suspension of equitable remedies, and sometimes of legal ones, from the Courts of Justice being shut up. Equitable rights continued to subsist notwithstanding ; and in 1782, Courts of Equity were established, with all the powers and authorities that the former Court of Chancery used and exercised, and that are properly and rightfully incident to such a Court, agreeably to the laws in force in the State, and not inconsistent with the Consti-stution. That the cognizance of charitable devises and bequests was taken by the Chancery in England, and that it was a power \u201c rightfully incident\u201d to such a Court at the date of the Charter, is shewn by the adjudged cases\u2014 \u25a0whether the Court of Chancery in this State actually ex-crcised a similar jurisdiction* there are now no means of ascertaining.\nThe objection in tills case is founded on the peculiar nature Of the subject as it is viewed by the laws of England. It is laid down in the books, that the King, as parens patriae, has the general superintendence of all charities not regulated by charter, which ho exercises by the keeper of his conscience, the Chancellor; and, therefore, the Attorney-General, at the relation of some informant, Where it is necessary, files ex officio, an information in the Court of Chancery to have the charity properly established and applied. It is also said, that the jurisdiction thus established, does not belong to the Court of Chancery as a Court of Equity, but as administering the prerogative and duties of the Crown; and that the duties vested in the Chancellor by the statute of Elizabeth are personal, and not in his ordinary or extraordinary jurisdiction in Chancery \u2014 the same, in fact, which he exercises with respect t.o idiots and lunatics. Admitting this to be so in the broadest terms, it does not, to my mind, present any real difficulty to the like power being exercised here. It opens a wide field of investigation, which I have reflected upon, but which I do not think it essential to enter into. The short ground upon which I should place it is, that, upon the revolution, the political rights and duties of the King devolved upon the people of this State in their sovereign capacity. That they, by their representatives, had a right to deposit the exercise of this power where tiiey pleased, and that they have placed it in tiie hands of the Courts of Equity. Whether this be a correct view or not, does not affect the principle of my opinion in this case; because, I think, that where there is a trust and a trustee, with some general or specific objects pointed out, or trustees for general or indefinite charity, a Court of Equity may, as a matter of trust, take cognizance of it in virtue 0f its ordinary jurisdiction. This position is maintained *he authorities quoted in a learned note to the Appendix of the 4th volume of Wheaton\u2019s Reports; which cases j jjave examine,d as faP as I have had. access to them\u2014 some in the Reports, and others in abridgments. The cases further shew, that in indefinite trusts, or trusts where some general objects are pointed out, the distinction most acted upon, is, that in a general indefinite purpose, not fixing itself upon any object, the disposition is in the King by sign manual. But where the execution is to be by a trustee, with general or some objects pointed out, the administration of the trust will be taken by the Court of Chancery, either as delegate of the Crown, or as a Court of Equity, and managed under a scheme reported by a Master and approved by the Court.\nI am consequently of opinion, that the demurrer be sustained, and the bill be dismissed.\n*\nWhite v.

GREEN","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6130377\/","date":"1824-11-01","court":"United States Circuit Court for the District of Rhode Island","content":"STORY, Circuit Justice.\nIn cases of this nature the court will look into all the facts stated in the return, and ascertain if they contain a satisfactory statement, upon which the party ought to be discharged. It will not discharge the defendant, simply because he declares, that the infant is not \u201cin his power, possession, control, or custody,\u201d if the conscience of the court is not satisfied, that all the material facts are fully disclosed. That would be to listen to mere forms against the claims of substantial justice, and the rights of personal liberty in the citizen. In ordinary cases, indeed, such a declaration is satisfactory, and ought to be decisive, because there is nothing before the court upon which it can ground a doubt of its entire verity, and that in a real and legal sense the import of the words \u201cpossession, power, or custody,\u201d is fully understood and met by the party. The cases of Rex v. Winton, 5 Term R. S9, and of In re Stacy, 10 Johns. 32S. show with what jealousy courts watch the terms of returns of this nature. See, also, Ex parte Eden, 2 Maul\u00e9 & S. 22G. In those cases there was enough on the face of the return to excite suspicions that more was behind, and that the party was really within the constructive control of the defendant. Upon examining the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied, that the return contains all those facts within the knowledge of the defendant, which are necessary to be brought before the court, to enable it to decide, whether he is entitled to a discharge, or, in other words, whether he has not a power to produce the infant, and control those in whose custody she is. There is no doubt, that an attachment is the proper process to bring the defendant into court. But suppose he were here, the next step would be to require him to purge his supposed contempt, and to answer in-terrogatox-ies. That is the very object of the present motion. But an attachment can be necessary only when the party is not present in court. The defendant is now personally present, and the court may directly make an order, that he shall answer farther interrogatories to be drawn up at the bar. It is wholly unnecessary to go a circuitous route, when thei\u2019e is a direct path open before us. I shall therefore make an order to this effect. Order aceoi-dingly.\nUpon this order the defendant answered a series of interrogatories put by leave of the court in writing to him. These, however, being still unsatisfactory to the plaintiff,\nE. Williams, in his' behalf, moved for an attachment, which motion was opposed by Cozzens & Hunter, for defendant. Upon this motion, a wide discussion arose as to the right of the father to have the custody of the infant under the circumstances of the case.\nSTORY, Circuit Justice. As to the question of the right of the father to have the custody'of his infant child, in a general sense it is true. But this is not on account of any absolute right of the father, but for the benefit of the infant, the law presuming it to be for his interest to be under the nurture and care of his natural protector, both for maintenance and education. When, therefore, the court is asked to lend its aid to put the infant into the custody of the father, and to withdraw him from other persons, it will look into all the circumstances, and ascertain whether it will be for the real, permanent interests of the infant; and if the infant be of sufficient discretion, it will also consult its personal wishes. It will free it from all undue restraint, and endeavour, as far as possible, to administer a conscientious, ..parental duty with reference to its welfare. It is an entire mistake to suppose the court is at all events bound to deliver over the infant to his father, or that the latter has an absolute vested right in the custody. The case of Rex v. De Manneville, 5 East, 221, is not inconsistent with this doctrine; but ou the other hand supposes its existence. The court there thought it for the interest of the child to give the custody to the father. The judges thought there was no reason to suppose the father would abuse his right, or injure the child. Lord Eldon, in De Manneville v. De Manneville, 10 Ves. 52, avowed his approbation of the doctrine, and said, he had, exercising the authority of the king, as parens patriae, removed children from the custody of their father, when bethought such custody unsuitable. The case of In re Wal-dron, 13 Johns. 419, is directly in point; and to the same effect is Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange, 982. My judgment follows these cases without hesitation.\nThe cause lay over until the next morning, when the parties entered into a specific-agreement, as to the custody of the infant, which, being sanctioned by the court, was by the consent entered of record. Whereupon further proceedings were stayed."},{"case_name":"JONES v. STOCKETT","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1718036\/","date":"1825-08-31","court":"High Court of Chancery of Maryland","content":"Bland, Chancellor.\nOrdered, that Richard G. Stockett, the petitioner, be, and he is hereby permitted and directed, to deposite any sum of money now in his hands, or which may hereafter come into his hands, as a part of the said trust fund, with the register, to be by him deposited in the Farmers Bank of Maryland to the credit of the case, subject to further order.\nThe plaintiffs Jones and wife, by their petition, stating that the defendant Stockett had, under this order, paid into court the sum of $1,652 28; and that the executors were perfectly willing that the money already deposited, and which might thereafter be deposited on account of the said trust fund, should be paid over to the plaintiff Samuel, upon his giving bond with approved surety. Whereupon they prayed that the same, together with all the residue of the trust fund, when deposited, might be paid to the petitioner Samuel, on his giving bond with approved surety.\n21st September, 1825.\nBland, Chancellor.\n-The petition of Samuel Jones of Joshua, and Ann his wife,- has been read and considered. It was my intention, by the order of the 31st of August last, to place the money constituting the legacy to the plaintiff Ann, at once in perfect security, and to give her time to be heaidttb|n the mode of investment, so far as the testator had allowed otJKP range of discretion in that respect. From the language of the Will, it certainly could not have been the intention of the testator' that the legacy he thus gave to his niece should be put into the hands of her husband, upon any terms whatever. But. apart from that manifest intention, Where the profits only, of a legacy are given, as in this instance, to a woman for life, and' the principal in remainder to her children, it might evidently be attended with the most pernicious and ruinous consequences to take the' prifacipal, given to the children in remainder, from the hands of the tr\u00fcste\u00e9s, and place it in the hands of their father. His influence might prevent them from exacting from him their just right during his life; and on his death insolvent, they might feel a great repugriance tb making his securities answer'for the loss they-had sustained by reason of his misfortunes, The good feelings between parent and child, so far from being put in jeopardy, should be sustained and cherished. Therefore, even if this money might be put out upo\u00f1 mere personal security, I should deem it improper to place it upon such security y in the hands of the father of those who are to take in remainder. The testator has, however, apparently \u00e1w\u00e1re of the ill.'consequences of such a disposition of the fund,.expressly declared it to be his .design, that the trustees should retain in their hands the principal sum of $7,000, and put the same out on interest on good security, for the purposes aforesaid.\nBut, as the annual and punctual payment of the interest payable to Ann, must depend in a great degree upon the form of the investment, I was unwilling to make the selection until the plaintiffs had been heard. The meaning of the phrase 1 good security,\u2019 used by the testator, must be taken in connexion with that indefinite, and perhaps great length of time, during which it is very evident he intended it should continue to he c good security;\u2019 and thus, understanding the testator to mean permanently and durably good security, I feel that my discretion must be limited to a selection among securities of tha't description; that is, government stock, or a mortgage on unincumbered real estate, or good bank stock. But apart from this manifestation of the testator\u2019s intention, it must be recollected, that generally, in cases of this kind, if the trustees were of themselves to put this legacy out on mere personal security, it would be deemed a breach of trust, and they would be held accountable accordingly. The prayer of the plaintiffs cannot be granted; and, therefore, it is. Ordered, that the said petition be, and the same is hereby dismissed with costs.\nOn the 16th of December, 1825, the defendant Wayman put in his answer, in which he admits the will of his testator; and states, that a provision having been made therein for the testator\u2019s nephew Larkin Shipley, as well as for the plaintiff, it was agreed, that the defendant should take charge of the bequest to the legatee Larkin; and that the other defendant should manage the legacy given to the plaintiff Ann; that a large proportion of the testator\u2019s estate consisted of bonds and notes, some of which, and particularly those deemed doubtful, had been collected, or pressed for payment, leaving such as were-good to stand on interest; considering them as good investments as could be made within the meaning of the testator\u2019s will; that he had made some payments to the plaintiff Ann; and that he had wished to have had the whole of her legacy paid over to her husband as proposed by him; but that the court had determined otherwise.\nAfter which Jones and wife, by their petition, prayed that the investment might be made in stock of the Bank of Westminster.\n20th January, 1826.\nBland, Chancellor.\u2014\nOrdered, that the trustees Stockett and Wayman, unless cause to the contrary be shewn by them, on or before the fourth day of the next March term, be and they are hereby directed and required to invest the money heretofore brought into this court, in stock of the Bank of Westminster; the said stock to be transferred to, and held by and in the name of the said trustees for the uses, intents and purposes in the proceedings mentioned, and the interest or dividends thereon, as the same may become due and be collected, shall be paid by them unto the said Ann, the wife of the said Samuel, during her natural life; and after her death the said bank stock shall be disposed of and pass as is directed by the last will and testament of the testator. And for the purpose of making such investment, the money will be directed to be paid to the trustees when required, Provided that, a copy of this order, together with a copy of the foregoing petition, be served on the said trustees on or before the twentieth day of February next.\nThe trustee Stockett, on the 16th of March, 1826, reported that he had received another sum of $1,900, and requested to be authorized to invest that- sum also; and said, that he had no interest adverse to that of the plaintiff\u2019s; and therefore was willing that the investment should be made as proposed, if the court thought the fund secure.\n18i\/i March, 1826.\nBland, Chancellor.\nOrdered, that the said trustees be and they are hereby authorized and directed to invest the additional sum of about $1,900 received lately by one of them, as stated, in stock of the Bank of Westminster, upon the terms and as prescribed by the order of the 20th of January last. And no cause having been shewn against the execution of the said order, the same is hereby declared to be absolute; and the said trustees are directed to invest the said sums of money accordingly.\nThe trustees Stockett and Way man reported that they had, as ordered, purchased stock in the Bank of Westminster at $1 per share above par, that is to say, that they had purchased capital stock to the amount of $3,330 for the sum of $3,552 in money. Which they prayed might be confirmed; and that the moneys deposited in court might be applied accordingly.\n20th April, 1826.\nBland, Chancellor.\u2014\nOrdered, that the said report be and the same is hereby ratified and confirmed; and the register is directed to draw a check on The Farmers Bank of Maryland for the whole sum of money which has been deposited, or \u2022so much thereof as now remains to the credit of this case, in favour of the said trustees or either of them, or for so much thereof as they or either of them may require for the purpose of its being applied as stated in the said report.\nThe parties agreed, that the case should be referred to the auditor to state an account of assets, &c. And of the sum due, if any, to the complainants on account of Ann Jones\u2019 annuity. And also submitted to the Chancellor, \u2018whether the loss of interest occasioned by the deposite of the moneys brought into court is to be borne by the complainants or the estate ?\u2019 and \u2018whether the complainants and defendants, or any of them, are to be allowed costs against the estate ?\u2019\n2bth April, 1827.\nBland, Chancellor.\nI have examined the proceedings and reflected upon the questions submitted. The plaintiffs by their bill complained, that the defendants had suffered the legacy, the profits of which were given to the plaintiff Ann, to remain in their hands unproductive; whereby the interest, which might otherwise have been accumulated and paid to her, was lost. And prayed, that the trustees might be ordered to make an investment thereof. The defendant Stockett answered, and brought into court a great proportion of the legacy, which was ordered to be deposited as usual, as I have before remarked, for safety, and until the plaintiffs should suggest a mode of investment. Hence, it is evident, that the plaintiffs, in effect, called the money into court; and it was their fault, that it remained here so long unproductive. The trustees being blameless, are therefore not chargeable; and there is no ground upon which these plaintiffs can have the estate taxed, to the prejudice of others, for the purpose of re-imbursing them for a loss occasioned by their own mismanagement or negligence : for even if the trustees had been guilty of any misconduct, the estate could not be charged to make good the loss; and upon the same general principles, neither these trustees nor the estate can be charged with costs,\nWhereupon it is Ordered, that the loss of interest occasioned by the deposite of any moneys in this court, pursuant to the order of the 31st of August, 1825, be borne by the complainants; that they pay all costs; and that this case be, and the same is hereby referred to the auditor, with directions to state an account or accounts, in pursuance of the foregoing agreement and of this order.\nAfter which the auditor made up a report, as of the 8th of November, 1827, which he filed on the 15th of the same month, in \u2022which he says that he had stated and therewith returned accounts A and B, between each of the defendants, as an executor, and the estate of Larkin Shipley, deceased; and also account C, between said estate and the complainants Jones and wife; that there was a balance in the hands of Wayman of $51 68, and in the hands of Stockett of $145 95; and that there was due to Jones and wife, on account of interest on their legacy, the sum of $144 01. The auditor further says, that he had allowed Stockett credit for the sum of $50, a fee to counsel retained by him to defend that suit.\nThe defendant Stockett excepted to the accounts A and B, because in said accounts the defendant Wayman was allowed one-half of the commissions heretofore allowed to this exceptant by the Orphans Court; and he excepted to the account C, because the complainants were thereby allowed interest on their legacy from the time of the death of the testator; whereas interest ought not to be allowed until twelve months thereafter.\n21 st February, 1828.\nBland, Chancellor.\nThe solicitors of the parties having been fully heard, the proceedings were read and considered. It is clear, that the allowance of commissions to executors, in all cases properly brought before an Orphans Court, is a matter as entirely within the jurisdiction of that tribunal as this ; and in so far as it appears, that the matter of commissions had been adjusted and determined by the Orphans Court, as has been done in this instance, the judgment of that tribunal cannot be reviewed or reversed by this court. Therefore the first exception must be sustained.\nThis legacy, the annual interest and profits of which alone have been given to the plaintiff Ann, during her life, is only payable out of the personal estate of the testator; as to which it has been laid down as a general rule that, as the executors must be allowed a reasonable time to collect the estate, first to satisfy the creditors and then the legatees of the deceased, no such legacy shall carry interest until one year after the death of the testator, And this general rule applies as well to annuities as to mere pecuniary legacies ; for an annuity so given is a legacy, and therefore even if the donation to the plaintiff Ann be regarded as a mere annuity, although with propriety it cannot be in all respects so considered, still it falls under the general character of a legacy, and must in this respect be governed by the same general rule, Where a parent gives a legacy to a child, especially if the child has no other means of support, there, because of the duty of a parent as far as he can to provide a maintenance for his child, the legacy shall carry interest from the death of the testator; and so too in all other cases, if such be the express declaration or manifest intention of the testator, the legacy shall bear interest from his death. But this legacy is given by an uncle to his niece and her children, and there is no intimation by the testator as to the time from which the legacy is to begin to bear interest, and therefore the second exception must also be sustained.\nIn regard to the fee here proposed to be allowed to the solicitor employed by the trustee, it has been with propriety laid down, that where a trustee, in the fair execution of his trust, has expended money by reasonably and properly taking opinions, and procuring directions that are necessary for the due execution of his trust, he is entitled not only to his costs, but also to his charges and expenses, under the head of just allowances, For these reasons this fee may well be allowed.\nWhereupon it is Ordered, that the said exceptions be ruled good, and that the auditor correct his statements accordingly.\nOn the 10th of March, 1828, the auditor reported, that he had corrected the accounts as ordered; that there was due from Way-man the sum of $183 42; from Stockett $9 79; and that Jones and wife had been overpaid their annuity to the amount of $289 99.\nAfter which, the trustees having brought in and deposited a further sum of money, it was, on the petition of the plaintiffs, ordered to be invested in stock of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Frederick County.\nOn the 15th of November, 1827, Richard G. Stockett and Henry Wayman filed their bill here against Samuel Jones of Joshua, and Ann his wife, and Larkin Shipley, an infant. This bill stated that the late Larkin Shipley, who was, at the time of his death, possessed of and entitled to considerable real and personal estate, by his will gave a legacy to this defendant Ann, and the residue of his estate to this defendant Larkin in the manner therein mentioned, and in- voted into this case the before-mentioned proceedings, under the bill filed by these defendants Jones and wife against these plaintiffs; which case had been referred to the auditor, who had stated several accounts. But that this defendant Larkin, not being a party to those proceedings, or bound thereby, might, at any future period, impeach the correctness of the accounts of these plaintiffs, which had been approved in that case; that, owing to peculiar circumstances, to the localities of the property of the testator, and to the residence of these plaintiffs, and the cestui que trusts, a division of the trust property, and of the duties of these plaintiffs, was desirable, so that the plaintiff Stockett might have the management of the fund invested for the benefit of this defendant Ann, and that the residue of the estate might be confided to the plaintiff Wayman. Whereupon, the bill prayed for such decree as the court might deem just.\nOn the 24th of December, 1827, Jones and wife filed their answer to this bill, in which they admit the will and proceedings in the suit instituted by them, and say, that, in consequence thereof, a portion of the legacy of $7,000, to wit: the sum of $3,552, or thereabouts, had been brought in and invested, although not expressly asked or required to be brought in; that they were extremely anxious to have the balance brought in and invested, as should be recommended by them, who were alone interested therein; but objected to the separating of the joint trust reposed in the plaintiffs relative to the said bequest; at all events, not until the whole sum should have been invested in a manner satisfactory to these defendants.\nOn the 26th of March, 1828, the infant defendant Larkin answered by his guardian ad litem, that he was unacquainted with the facts stated in the bill, and prayed the protection of the court.\nOn the 31st of July, 1828, Larldn Shipley, then an infant, by John Shipley, his guardian and next friend, filed his bill against Richard G. Stockett, Henry Wayman, and Samuel Jones of Joshua, and Ann his wife. This bill states that the late Larldn Shipley made his will,' &c. as before stated, which proceedings in the suit of Jones and wife, against Stockett and Wayman, he exhibited and prayed, might be taken as a part of this his bill; that this plaintiff Larkin was still an infant under the guardianship of his father John Shipley, who was unable out of his own funds, suitably to maintain and educate him; that during a short period, after the de'ath of the testator, the defendants Stockett and Wayman, had advanced to the father and guardian of this plaintiff small sums for his maintenance and education, but have latterly refused to make any further advances, whereby he has been unjustly deprived of the most important benefit intended for film by the testator; that there were sundry debts due to the testator, which the defendants Stockett and Wayman had neglected to sue for and collect; and, amongst others, a debt due from the defendant Stockett, secured by mortgage for $3,186, with interest from the 5th of May, 1811, payable annually; which interest had not been accounted for. Whereupon, the bill prayed that the trustees might be ordered to render a true account of the management of the trust fund; that they might execute the trust; that the residue of the legacy to this defendant Ann might be invested; and the residue of the trust property ascertained and invested in some productive fund, and the rents of the lands, and the interest of the money paid over to the guardian of this plaintiff, for his maintenance and education; that the said trustees might be ordered to collect immediately all debts due to the testator, the interest of which was not punctually paid annually, and be compelled to pay interest on all sums improperly retained in their hands, and to give security for the faithful performance of their trust, and that the plaintiff might have such other relief as the nature of his case might require.\nIt appears, from a certificate of the register of wills of Anne Arundel county, that John Shipley had, on the 27th of July, 1828, given bond as guardian of Larkin Shipley.\nOn the 22d of September, 1828, the defendants Jones and wife put in their answer to this bill, and admitted the before-mentioned facts and proceedings, as therein stated, and prayed that the mortgage of the estate of the defendant Stockett might not be considered as a part of the legacy given to them, but that the trustees might be ordered to collect the estate of the testator, and make an investment of the balance of their legacy, giving to them an opportunity of making a suggestion of what might appear to them to be fit and proper objects of investment, they being alone interested in the said investment. And they say that they are willing that the balance of their legacy may be brought in and invested as before directed, although the bringing in of the sum of $3,552, as before stated, into this court, was not only not prayed for by these defendants, but was contrary to their wishes, and occasioned to them a loss of five months interest, as aforesaid; and that the course taken heretofore by this court, without the desire, and to the disadvantage of these defendants; is now prayed for and requested; because it will be more satisfactory and safe, and there will be no probability that the same may not be promptly invested.\nOn the 20th of October, 1828, these defendants Stockett and Wayman-, by their petition, prayed that this defendant Samuel Jones might be appointed trustee in their place, \u00f3f the legacy of $7,000, and-that the amount might be paid into his hands' as such, to be held and disposed of by him, under the direction of the. court.\nOn the 27th of October, 1829, the defendant Wayman filed his answer, in which he admitted as before the facts, as stated in the previous proceedings, and prayed that those proceedings might be taken as a part, of this, his answer. He then set forth the reasons why some of the debts due to his testator had not been sooner collected, and why some of them still remained to be .got in; and he then further stated, that the plaintiff Larkin was then an infant, about twelve years of age, and lived with his father, who-could no,t require that any portion of the profits of-the estate should be applied to the support of the plaintiff; that, as was intended by the testator, he had placed the plaintiff at a school, when he was old enough, and continued him there until his father took him away; and he. was not then at any school; that the father was not entitled to have any part of the rents and profits of the testator\u2019s estate paid to him for the support of his own child, or while he refused to permit the child to receive the education intended to be given to him by the testator. And, therefore, this defendant had for some time declined to pay any thing to the father, conceiving that, if he were to do so, it would not be applied according to the intention of the testator.\nOn the 28th of October, 1828, the defendant Stockett put in his answer, in which he prays that the former proceedings may be taken as a part of this, his answ\u00e9r, and admitting the facts which he had therein admitted, says that he is indebted by mortgage, as stated in the bill, and that he is ready and willing to account, &c.\nTo these answers the plaintiffs put in a general replication, and a commission was issued, under which testimony, was taken and returned, from which it appeared that the pecuniary circumstances of John Shipley, the father of the plaintiff Larkin\/ Shipley, were such that he was unable to give to his son even a common\u2019country school education, without labouring under some inconvenience with regard to the rest of his family. After the return of this commission, these four cases were together brought before the court.\n5th JVovernber, 1829.\nBland, Chancellor.\nThese cases standing ready for hearing, and having been argued by the counsel for the complainant Larkin Shipley of John, and the defendants Stockett and Wayman, it is thereupon, with the consent of the parties, Decreed, that these cases be, and they are hereby consolidated, and that the said defendants Richard G. Stockett and Henry Way-man account with the complainants in the premises. It is further Decreed, that these cases, so consolidated, be, and they are hereby-referred to the auditor to state the accounts, and to inquire whether any, and what allowance shall be made, and to whom, for the maintenance and education of the complainant for the time past or to come *, and that he take any testimony adduced by either party-relating to the said matter. It is further Decreed, that the defendants Richard G. Stockett and Henry Wayman make a full and particular report of their proceedings, as trustees under the will of Larkin Shipley, deceased, setting forth what debts due the deceased they have collected, and when; specifying the amount of principal and of interest and costs separately, and what investments they have made of the same, or of any other funds of the deceased in their hands; and that they bring into this court any securities, or evidences of loans, or investments of any of the said funds, and the vouchers for any expenditure heretofore allowed them by this court, or the Orphans Court of Anne Arundel county. And it is further Decreed, that the said Riehard G. Stockett and Henry Wayman, on or before the fifteenth day of November next, file, in this court, a bond or bonds, with surety to be approved by the Chancellor, in the penalty of $20,000, with condition for the faithful discharge of the trusts reposed in them by the will of the said Larkin Shipley, deceased.\nAfter which, the auditor made up a report, as of the 30th of November, 1829, which he filed on the 4th of December following, in which he says that Stockett and Wayman, and the solicitor of Shipley, had appeared before him; that Wayman had filed his report and vouchers, with an agreement signed by the parties, and that Stockett had also filed his report, from all which, and the proceedings, as directed by the decree of the 5th of November, he had stated, first, an account between Wayman and the estate of the testator, from which it appeared that Wayman had in his hands the sum of $3,105 75; second, an account between Stoclcett and the said estate, in which he was charged with the arrearages of interest on his mortgage to the testator to this date; leaving a balance in this executor\u2019s hands of $827 04; third, an account between the said estate and Jones and wife, of their principal legacy and interest thereon. From which, it appears that, on account of the principal legacy of $7,000, the sum of $3,552 has been invested, and the further sum of $822 40 is deposited in court to be invested, leaving a balance of $2,625 60 to be provided for; and that the sum of $97 90 was due to Jones and wife for arrearages of their annuity to this date. The auditor further says, that the parties in their agreement annexed to the report of Wayman have assumed that the sum of $150 per annum would be a reasonable allowance for the maintenance and education of the infant Larkin from the death of the testator; and under the circumstances the auditor was inclined to adopt the estimate. The infant Larkin was admitted to be about twelve years of age, and excluding some small balances due, the amount of which could not be exactly ascertained, the residue of the personal estate, bequeathed to the said Larkin, might be assumed to consist of,\nThe mortgage debt of Richard G. Stockett, . . $3,186 00\nBalance as cash in his hands, ....... 827 04\nDo. in the hands of Henry Wayman, . . . 3,105 75\nPrincipal debt due from Elisha Brown, of Samuel, and Samuel Brown, junior, . ... . . . 437 00\n7,555 79\nWhich is charged with the balance of the legacy bequeathed to Mrs. Jones and children, . . 2,625 60\nClear balance,............$4,930 19\nThe estate bequeathed to Larkin Shipley, including a real estate which then rented for $36, might therefore be safely estimated to yield two hundred and fifty dollars per annum. The auditor moreover says, that it also appeared from the agreement aforesaid, that the said Larkin had been maintained and educated by his father, John Shipley, from April, 1827, to the present time; for which the proper allowance at the rate aforesaid, would be $393 75. And that he had received on account $70; leaving a balance due of $323 75. And in addition to the said balance, the said John Shipley, as next friend, claims to be re-imbursed his legal costs of suit, and also, the sum of $40 as an additional fee to his solicitor, \u25a0 which w!as in the opinion of the auditor a reasonable fee.\nThe plaintiff, Larkin Shipley, excepted to the account of the trustee Stockett, designated by the auditor as the second account. And also to the auditor\u2019s account, filed on the 15th of November, 1827, in the case of Jones and wife, which by the interlocutory decree of the 5th of November, had been consolidated with this case. 1. Because, in the account filed on the 15th of November, 1827, the expenditures and commissions of the said Stockett, were allowed out of the principal sums received by him; whereas, they ought to have been allowed out of the interest due on his mortgage annually. 2. Because, in the second account, filed on the 4th December, Stockett was charged with simple interest on his mortgage; whereas, the interest being payable annually, ought to have been paid in the discharge of the annuity due to Jones and wife; or, otherwise laid out for the benefit of the estate, which not having been done, compound interest ought to be charged.\n28ih January, 1830\nBland, Chancellor.\nThis case, as consolidated, standing ready for hearing, and having been submitted on the notes of the solicitors of the parties, the proceedings were read and considered.\nThe original plaintiffs Jones and wife, seem to have taken some very erroneous views of their case, which it may be well here to notice, lest improper inferences should otherwise be deduced from them. They have roundly affirmed, that they alone were interested, in the investment of this legacy of $7,000.\nThis positive and comprehensive allegation, to say the least of it, could only have proceeded from inattention to the express language of the will under which they claim; by which, it unequivocally appears, that although the testator says, I give to my niece Jinn Shipley, the sum of $7,000; yet he does so, upon the express condition, that no more than \u2018the annual interest thereof, shall be paid to her yearly during her natural life.\u2019 By which the testator, in this peculiar and mixed disposition of that amount of his estate, in effect, gave her nothing more than a legacy in nature of an annuity, constituted of only such profits as might be safely derived from $7,000 so disposed of. And consequently the plaintiff Samuel Jones, became entitled only, in right of his wife, to that indefinite annuity, during her life. But the testator directs, that, after her death, the $7,000 shall go to her lawful issue; and therefore, her children by Jones and by any other husband stand alike and next in remainder; and on her leaving no lawful issue, to go over to others. Therefore, so far from the plaintiffs Jones and wife being alone interested in the investment, those in remainder have, by much, the largest interest in the safe disposition of this sum; so that the whole principal may reach them undiminished after the life interest, m its profits, shall have fallen in. But as the plaintiffs Jones and wife, have an interest in its being most profitably disposed of, compatibly with its ultimate safety, it was obviously proper that they should be consulted so far, and to that extent; and they were so heard accordingly. But the court considered itself bound to act as the ex ojfido guardian of the interests of those who are to take in remainder; and who may not be now in existence, or if they are, having no present vested right, could not be made parties to this suit. It is therefore perfectly clear, that Jones and wife are not alone interested in the investment of this sum of money.\nThe plaintiffs Jones and wife, have also affirmed, that they did not expressly ask or require the $7,000 to be brought in; and that the doing so, was not only not prayed for by them, but was contrary to their wishes, and had occasioned to them a loss of five months\u2019 interest.\nBut, by their bill, filed about eighteen months after the death of the testator, they complain, that the executors had not paid them all to which they were entitled; that they had suffered the money to remain unproductive in their hands, and had failed to execute their trust \u2014 whereupon the bill prayed, that the trustees might account, and especially, that they should be required to put the $7,000 out at interest, so as to have it made productive to the plaintiffs. Jones and wife, thus expressly made it a ground of complaint, that the money remained idle in the hands of the trustees; and also expressly prayed for the direction of the court to the trustees as to the investment. The defendant Stockett, at the very next term after that to which he had been summoned; and as soon as he could have been compelled, or was expected to appear and answer, put in his answer, submitted to account immediately, and to such directions as the court should give in relation to the investment ; and in a few months thereafter, offered to bring into court a large amount applicable to the trusts of the will; and asked for the direction of the court as to the disposition of it; which money was thereupon ordered to be brought in and deposited, subject to further order. The ground of complaint against the trustee Stockett, was therefore, without delay, removed both in word and deed; and a part, at least, of the subject was placed in a condition to have the prayer of the plaintiffs Jones and wife, granted at any moment when they should move, so as to enable the court to act with a due regard to the interests of all concerned.\nIt has been long, and well settled, that in all cases where property has been vested in a trustee; or placed in his hands; or put under his control for the purpose of securing it for the benefit of any one; or to insure its proper application in any legal way as prescribed by the owrner, that although such trustee may, in almost all cases, if he thinks proper, take upon himself the risk of properly executing the trust without assistance from any quarter; yet he is not absolutely bound to do so. He may in all cases where the nature of the trust is governed by principles of equity, as most commonly happens, ask the direction of a Court of Chancery; and act under the indemnity of its decree; not because such a court is, in itself, considered as a proper or suitable agent for the mere safekeeping, or management of any property; but because where property has been put into a particular course, allowed and regulated only by principles of equity, it is fit and proper, that all who have a beneficial vested interest in it; as well as the agent to whose management it has been confided, should have an opportunity of coming before a tribunal whose peculiar province it is to apply such principles; and have such property so regulated; as well that those who may be then, or thereafter beneficially interested, may sustain no loss, as that the trustee may fall into no mistakes, nor be subjected to any unreasonable responsibility in cases, where the rules of equity, by which his administration must be governed, are complex and of difficult application. And therefore it is, that in all such cases, where a trustee comes before a court of equity, as a plaintiff, or is brought before it as a defendant, and declines to execute the trust without the direction and indemnity of the court, he is held to be so entirely justifiable in thus seeking its protection, that he is never charged with interest or costs; and that all such losses and expenses are directed to be borne by the particular trust fund in regard to which the direction has been required.\nNow in the case under consideration, the plaintiffs Jones and wife, had complained, that these trustees had suffered the trust fund to remain in their hands unproductive; and one of the trustees, for they cannot act separately, came in at once, submitted to, and prayed the direction of the court as to the mode of executing the trust \u2014 whence it was clear, that no investment could be made until directed by the court; and, as in that interval the trustees could not be charged with interest, no profits, to which alone Jones and wife were entitled, could have been derived from the $7,000. But Jones and wife had themselves complained, that to. suffer the legacy to remain in the hands of the trustees would put at great hazard the principal sum; and consequently, the interest thereon; indeed, it was obvious, that the entire value of their interest in the sum of $7,000, depended altogether upon its being immediately placed in safety; and, as soon thereafter as it might be judiciously done, profitably invested. It therefore clearly followed, that although Jones and wife had not, in so many words, prayed, that the legacy of $7,000 should be brought into court; that nevertheless, it was the necessary result of the actual complaint and prayer of their bill, and most emphatically so after they had been informed by the answer of Stockett, that the trustees declined to execute their trust without the direction and indemnity of the court; for then the bringing of the money into court was the most direct and suitable answer which could have been given to their complaint; and the best step which could have been taken in their behalf, as preparatory to that investment for which they especially prayed. But it would seem from their answer, and the petition of the trustees, filed on the 20th of October, 1828, that they had had other objects in view; and that they had been thwarted in their expectations by the order of the 21st of September, 1825.\nThe trustee Stockett, in his report in answer to the order of the 20th of January, 1826, seems to have misunderstood the Chancellor ; and to have formed an inadequate notion of his own situation. If by an interest in the matter, he means a pecuniary benefit, it is certain, that he not only has no interest adverse to that of Jones and wife, but none whatever in opposition to any one else. But, as trustee he holds an important office; and he has duties to perform which have a direct bearing as well upon the interests of Jones and wife as upon all others who may take in remainder after them. And consequently, when he comes, or is brought here, in respect of that office and those duties, although he may with propriety claim the direction and indemnity of the court, he cannot be justified in simply casting the whole matter before it, and leaving it to act blindly without information, or upon mere presumptions. He is one of the fiduciaries of this property, chosen by the late owner, as a trustworthy agent for conducting it along a prescribed line; in regard to which the court always expects to hear from him; and, when he stands blameless, hears him with favour and confidence. Therefore, when such a trustee asks the assistance and protection' of the court, in the execution of his trust, it is his duty to give th\u00e9 court all the information in his power, in order to enable it to give directions most suitable to the true nature of the case, and such as may be alike beneficial to all concerned.\nPassing from the consideration of these matters in relation to the legacy given to the plaintiff Ann for life with remainder over, it will be seen, that there has been admitted into this case, as now consolidated, a new plaintiff, Larkin Shipley, another legatee under this same will, claiming a legacy of a similar kind; and which therefore, must, in so far as the two legacies are substantially alike, be governed by the same directions that have been given in relation to the legacy bequeathed to the plaintiff Ann. But in regard to the legacy to the plaintiff Larlcin other questions have arisen, from his infancy and peculiar situation, which call for other and further directions to the trustees as to the disposition, in some respects, of the legatee himself as well as of his legacy.\nThe directions of the testator are clear and explicit, 'that my said trustees shall have and retain the sole possession and custody of the said estate so given as aforesaid to my said nephew Larkin for the purpose of educating him, and are to rent out the real estate, and put out the money on interest to the best advantage; and pay away the yearly proceeds after his arrival at age to him; but to retain a control over the principal till the objects of this bequest and devise are fully complied with.\u2019 Hence it is manifest, that to these trustees alone have been confided the means of accomplishing the laudable intentions of this testator.\nWhere a large legacy is given to an infant, and it vests in him immediately, or ultimately at all events, it has been usual to allow an adequate maintenance out of the property so given, and to order it to be paid to the father for that purpose, if he should not be of sufficient ability to maintain his child in a manner suitable to the fortune so given, But in this case the bequest is special and peculiar. The probable or possible misapplication by the father of the proceeds of the property bequeathed to this infant, seems to have been distinctly within the contemplation of the testator. For the trustees are expressly directed to retain the sole possession of the property for the purpose of educating the infant; and there is no provision for his maintenance, except, as an indispensable means of educating him; that is, while he may be at school, and not residing with his father. The distinctly expressed intentions oF the testator are that the infant be educated; that so much of the yearly proceeds of the property as may be necessary are to be applied for that purpose; and that all over and above what may be necessary to attain that object shall be put out on interest to the best advantage, and paid to him after his arrival at age; or, in other words, that if, from any cause, he cannot be educated as desired, he shall have the money which might have been spent in that way.\nIt is clear, that upon mere common law principles, and by means of a writ of habeas corpus alone, the Chancellor, the judges, or the courts of common law can do little more than relieve any one from illegal restraint, The Chancellor, however, not only has the power, by habeas corpus, to discharge any one from illegal confinement, but he has had delegated to him, as representing the state in its capacity of parens patriae, the power to provide, according to law, for the safety and proper treatment of infants who are unable to take care of themselves, It was only as to the extent of this large parental authority of the court, that I had entertained some doubts. My first impression was, when this case was opened before me, that this court could not, for any purpose however apparently laudable, deprive a father of the care and custody of his infant children; thrown upon him by the law, not for his gratification, but on account of his duties to them, with reference to the public welfare, and place them against his will in the hands of another,\nBut, upon a more careful investigation, I find, that although it is admitted to be always a delicate thing for the court to interfere against the parental authority, yet that it will do so when it becomes necessary for the safety, protection, and obvious benefit of the infant. The court founding its judgment in such cases, as in those between husband and wife, upon an admission that the tie which binds them together cannot be severed by it; but, yet that a partial or a temporary separation has become necessary for the protection of the weaker or defenceless party; and thus, so far, allowing a stronger policy to over-rule a weaker one. The court will not permit the colour of parental authority to work the ruin of the child, or suffer the child to be sacrificed in any way to the views of the father, And therefore, where the father was infamously profligate and vicious in his habits, and course of conduct; or had attempted to associate his infant children with a lewd woman he had brought into his house; or was guilty of gross ill treatment and cruelty towards them, they were removed from his custody, But the father has no right to the custody of his bastard child; and it may be taken even from its mother, and placed beyond the reach of contamination from her vicious habits. But, as in thus separating parent and child, the only object is to protect the infant from the vices, the maltreatment, or the miscon duct of the parent, every affectionate and tender feeling which should subsist between them will be sustained and cherished as far as practicable; and, for that purpose, they will be allowed to visit each other as often as may be compatible with the safety and good morals of the infant,\nApart, however, from- any positively vicious conduct of a father which might, of itself, afford a sufficient ground for having him separated from his children, a parent cannot be allowed, capriciously, to disappoint the just hopes and expectations of his child. For, although it is, by law, the duty of a parent to maintain his child, yet, where the father was in very indigent circumstances, and the child had had given to him a large fortune, such parent was not allowed to prevent the child from being maintained and educated in such manner\u2018as his fortune could well afford, and with the advantages he was thus justly entitled to expect; or where the father takes a benefit under the will, by having a legacy given to himself, and also in consideration of a large legacy given to his child, consents that her maintenance and education shall be given up to the management of trustees,\nBut, although it may be admitted that this jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, as between parent and child, has been substantially established, yet it cannot be denied that there are many cases in which it would be exceedingly difficult to exercise such authority successfully, and with real advantage to the infant,\nIn the case under consideration there is no evidence whatever of any vicious habits, or improper treatment of the father towards the legatee, or any other of his children; nor does there appear to have been any such great pecuniary difference made by this legacy between this legatee and his father, as in any respect to call for a check upon the parental authority for the benefit of the infant. The father, we must presume, from the proofs, is an industrious labouring citizen, with a large family about him; who has not the means of bestowing any thing more than what is called a common country school education upon any of them. His son Larkin, the legatee, has had given to him an estate in the nature of an annuity for life, amounting to no more than $250 per annum; from which alone, it is true, that he may be able to obtain a much better education than his father can give him; yet his expectations in life, from such an estate, cannot be presumed to rise so far above those to which he might look as a member of his father\u2019s family, as to suggest the propriety of his being brought up with higher hopes, much less to justify any suppression of his father\u2019s authority over him. Nevertheless, from the terms of this bequest, which, beyond a specified expenditure, is to accumulate until the legatee attains his full age, as well as from the principles of equity by which this case must be governed, if the father refuses to permit these trustees to have the management of his maintenance and education, I can order nothing to be paid to him for those or any other purposes. And as the father has never, in any way, consented to part with his son, in consideration of his being maintained and educated, as directed by the testator, I cannot, on that ground, interfere with the connexion between him and his child. But to whatever school he may be permitted to go, by his father, the trustees will be ordered to pay all expenses, to the extent of the annual income of his legacy, including maintenance for that purpose, if the school should be deemed sufficient, and happens to be too distant for him to reside with his father.\nThere seems to have been an understanding between these trustees and the father of Larkin, the legatee, that he was, at all events, to be maintained and educated by them; and, under that impression, they have made some advances to the father on that account.\nI shall, therefore, on the ground of allowing that to stand which appears to have been well intended, and might have been ordered, affirm the auditor\u2019s report, in this respect, awarding so much, as therein stated, to be paid to the father.\nTrustees are never charged, in any way, but on the ground of some fault or neglect. Here no misconduct can be imputed to these trustees; and, therefore, the plaintiff Larkin Shipley\u2019s exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report must be over-ruled.\nWhereupon it is Decreed, that the trustees Richard G. Stockett and Henry Wayman without delay invest the residue of the amount of the legacy given to the said Ann Jones in such stocks or way as may be suggested by the said Jones and wife as heretofore allowed; and that the investment be made in the names of the trustees as directed by the order of the 20th of January, 1826. And it is further Decreed, that the trustees Richard G. Stockett and Henry Wayman apply the yearly proceeds of the property devised and bequeathed by the testator Larkin Shipley to his nephew Larkin to his education only so long as he may reside with his father. But, that the trustees, with the permission of the father of the infant Larkin Shipley, without delay, place him at some good grammar school in this state, there to be educated as directed by the testator until the further order of this court; and that the said trustees pay all the expense, as well of his maintenance as of his education at such grammar school, if the said infant should not reside with his father, out of the annual income of his property so as aforesaid given to him. And it is further Decreed, that subject to, and excepting the applications of the yearly proceeds herein before directed, the said trustees without delay invest all the moneys so as aforesaid given unto the said infant Larkin Shipley, as well the principal thereof as all accumulations of interest, dividends, rents, issues and profits arising from the property so devised and bequeathed; which have been or may hereafter be collected, accrue and come to their hands, exclusive of the principal sum secured by the said mortgage executed by the said Richard G. Stockett, which is hereby declared to be an investment for so much, in the stock of The Farmers Bank of Maryland; or in the stock of some one of the banks of the city of Baltimore which have been incorporated by the laws of this state; the said stocks to be transferred unto and held by and in the name of the said trustees or the survivor of them for the uses, intents, and purposes in the will in the proceedings mentioned; the interest or dividends thereon, as the same may become due and be collected, shall be applied as hereinbefore directed. And it is further Decreed, that the reports of the auditor, so far as regards the accounts of the said trustees; and also in so far as the same accords in other respects with this decree be and the same are hereby ratified and confirmed; and so far as the same, with the exceptions thereto, may be at variance with this decree the same are hereby rejected and over-ruled. And it is further Decreed, that all the costs of these suits and proceedings to be taxed by the register, except where such costs have been otherwise directed to be paid by any previous order, be paid by the said trustees, and deducted, in due proportion, from the proceeds of the property of the said legatees, which have or may come to their hands.\nOn the 22d of February, 1830, the trustee Wayman, by way of report, brought into court the vouchers of three claims which he had held for the estate and legatees of his testator; and declining to give bond, as required by the decree of the 5th of November, 1829, said, that in conformity, as he believed, to the wishes of Jones and wife, recommended in his place Joshua Jones, of Frederick county. And Jones and wife, by their petition, filed on the 9th of March following, expressed their assent to the resignation of the trustee Wayman; and proposed, with the approbation of the court, that Joshua Jones, of Frederick county, should be appointed in his place. To which proposition the solicitor of the trustee Stockett, and of Larldn Shipley, the legatee, by their note in writing, expressed their consent. Upon which the matter was submitted.\n20th March, 1830.\nBland, Chancellor.\nThe petitioner is Samuel Jones of Joshua, that is, as it would seem, the son of this Joshua Jones of Frederick. If that be the case, then it appears, that after having failed to have himself appointed trustee of this legacy of $7,000, and thus directly getting it into his own hands, he now, indirectly, seeks to attain the same object, by having it placed in the hands of his father. In answer to such movements I would say, in the language of one of England\u2019s most extinguished Chancellors, Lord Nottingham, {I like not that a man should be ambitious of a trust when he can get nothing but trouble by it;\u2019 and therefore declare, without any reflection on this Joshua Jones of Frederick, that he shall not, as trustee, meddle with this trust.\nIt is true, that this court may, for just cause, remove a trustee and appoint another in his place; as where the trustee had become, by reason of age or infirmity, unable to attend to his duties; or where a feme sole trustee had married a foreigner; for, although a feme covert is not incompetent to officiate as a trustee, yet there is much inconvenience in her doing so, and especially when she may, as the wife of a foreigner, be taken out of the state; or. where the trustee had gone abroad to reside; or had absconded on a charge of forgery; or had been guilty of a breach of trust; or even where his co-trustees, there being several others, had a great aversion to act with him. The court may also appoint a new trustee in the place of one who declines to act. But if the deed or will should even expressly clothe a trustee with a discretionary power to appoint a new one, still the court will not permit him to do so, without its sanction; it not being a sufficient answer to say, that the court will take care to prevent the consequences ; the mischief is, in a great measure, done by the appointment ; the necessity of getting back the legal estate. The act of assembly has provided, that if any person shall die, leaving real or personal estate to be sold for any purpose, and shall not, by will, or other instrument of writing, appoint a person as trustee to sell or convey; or the person appointed shall die, or refuse to act, the Chancellor may appoint a trustee for such purpose. But although a trustee, who had accepted the trust, may, by the consent of most of the cestui que trusts, and with the sanction of the court, because of his unwillingness to continue any longer in the office, be discharged, and another appointed in his place; yet the cestui que trusts must be fully apprised of his application to be discontinued. And if it appears that the most interested, or greater part of them are not then in being, or are incompetent to consent, his request will not be gratified, since he cannot, by any act of his own, without communication with his cestui que trusts, denude himself of the character of trustee till he has performed his trust.\nHere, however, it does not appear that there is any just cause of complaint against these trustees; and the trustee Wayman, having voluntarily taken upon himself the trust, cannot now be permitted, at his pleasure, to abandon it; and there is no one competent to consent to his discharge on behalf of the infant plaintiff Larldn Shipley and his issue, and thefetne covert Ann Jones and her issue, who are the principal, if not the only cestui que trusts.\nThe act of assembly declares, that in cases where trustees have been appointed by last will and testament to execute any trust, and any person interested in the execution thereof shall shew that it is necessary for the safety of those interested, that the trustees should give bond and security, the Chancellor may order them to do so; and if they shall fail to comply, to displace them. The decree of the 5th of November, 1829, which required these trustees to give bond, was passed with the express consent of their solicitors. But, as no application has, as yet, been made by any person interested to force them to do so, the requisition of the decree may, in this respect, be allowed to stand over as regards Wayman, the trustee Stockett having given bond, until such an application shall be made.\nIt is, therefore, Ordered, that the said Henry Wayman be, and he is hereby continued as trustee, according to the will of the said Larkin Shipley, deceased.\nAfter which, various other proceedings were had, and sundry other investments made; and the plaintiff Larkin Shipley having attained his full 'age, the case was submitted for a final decree and directions. When, on the 24th of January, 1838, it was determined that the words c issue of his body,\u2019 in the devise to him, were words of purchase; so that he took only an estate for life; and the trustees were directed, as before, to make investments accordingly.\n(a)\nCarpenter v.

Pratt. \u2014 William Pratt, an infant of eleven years of age, by Christopher Cross Eouth, his uncle and next friend, on the 6th of February, 1773, filed his petition in thi3 court, in which he stated, that John Pratt, his father, had married Mary Buck, by whom he had issue, the petitioner his eldest son, and several other children; that she afterwards died seized in fee of divers lands, leaving the petitioner her eldest son and heir at law; that the petitioner\u2019s father afterwards married Elizabeth Griffith; and on the 21st of November, 1770, made his last will, in which, among other things, he devised as follows, to wit: T bequeath unto my son William Pratt one negro girl named Beck; and it is my will and desire, that my beloved wife Elizabeth Pratt should have the bringing up of my said son William Pratt, and that he should live with her until he shall be of the age of twenty-one years, and that my said wife should have possession of my dwelling plantation until my aforesaid son William shall arrive at the age aforesaid. All the remainder of my personal estate, after paying my just and lawful debts, and the above legacies, I give and bequeath to be equally divided among my children. And I do hereby nominate and appoint my beloved wife Elizabeth Pratt executrix of this my last will and testament.\u2019 That afterwards John Pratt, the petitioner\u2019s father, died seized and possessed of other lands than were devised by the said will, which have descended to the petitioner his heir at law. That after the death of the testator, the said Elizabeth proved the will and took upon herself the execution thereof, and also the guardianship of the petitioner. That she hath been extremely remiss as executrix and guardian, whereby the estate of the testator hath been much wasted and embezzled; and the petitioner neglected and in want of the common necessaries of life; nor hath she paid the least attention to his education. That such hath been her conduct since the death of the testator, which the petitioner hopes there may be no necessity particularly to expose, that she has lost all the respect of her neighbours and acquaintances, and by them is esteemed a woman of an infamous character. That she had endeavoured secretly to convey away sundry negro slaves and other personal estate of the testator with a view to defraud the petitioner and others, the children of the testator, and to deprive her surety for the due execution of the \u25a0will of the means to counter secure himself, he having on petition obtained an order from the County Court to possess himself of the estate of the testator in her hands. From all which the petitioner was truly apprehensive of his suffering greatly with respect to the profits of his real estate for which there was no security; and that his education would be totally neglected. Whereupon he prayed, that, as the said Elizabeth had disqualified herself to be his guardian, he might be removed from her custody, and have another guardian assigned for him, or have such other relief as might seem meet and agreeable to justice. To this petition there was subjoined an affidavit of the next friend of the truth of its .allegations, made before a justice of the peace.\n6tk February, 1773. \u2014 Eden, Chancellor. \u2014 Ordered, that the same Elizabeth Pratt appear in the High Court of Chancery on Monday, the twenty-second day of this instant, February, to shew cause, if she hath any, why the said William Pratt, with his estate, should not be removed from the custody and guardianship of the same Ellizabeth, and some other guardian be assigned for him. And that the said Christopher C. Routh also appear at the same time and place, and bring with him the aforesaid William Pratt; and then and there produce testimony to prove and establish the several allegations of the said petition; and that a copy of the same petition and this order be served on the same Elizabeth Pratt five days next preceding the said twenty-second day of this instant, February.\nCopies having been served as directed, the case was again brought before the court.\n17th Jlpril, 1773. \u2014 Eden, Chancellor. \u2014 Upon consideration of the said petition; and the same Elizabeth Pratt having been properly served with a copy of the said petition and the order thereon; and the said Christopher C. Routh being present with the said William Pratt, and having fully proved and established the several allegations of the said petition. It is hereby Ordered and Decreed, that the said William Pratt, with his estate, be removed from the custody and guardianship of the same Elizabeth Pratt, and that the custody, guardianship and care of the same William Pratt, with his estate, he and is hereby committed to the same Christopher Cross Routh, the said Christopher C. Routh giving security to account for the profits of the estate of the said William Pratt according to such orders as shall from time to time be made by the Chancellor of this province for the time being, and to the same William Pratt when he shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years, and his executors and administrators, deducting thereout what may be sufficient for the maintenance and education of the same William Pratt, without diminution of the principal; and conduct himself by and pursue and keep the orders and directions of the acts of assembly of this province relative to guardians who are either appointed by the respective county courts of this province, or therein chosen by orphans, where the same shall not be inconsistent with or repugnant to the orders from time to time of the Chancellor for the time being.\nAfter which C.

M\u2019Murdo and Prentis","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6732349\/","date":"1827-03-14","court":"Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia","content":"March 14. .The Judges delivered their opinions.\nJUDGE CARR.\nThis case brings before us, for the first time, the question whether an administrator do bonis non can, by bill in equity, call the representative of the first administrator to account, for assets of the first intestate, wasted or converted by the first administrator. This is a question, not of practice, but of sheer law; depending on the extent of the commission of the administrator de bonis non, what'are his powers, and how far he represents the estate of his intestate.\nBefore I enter on the consideration of this subject, I will say a wotd with respect to the practice of the country, so much relied on. If it had been a general practice for administrators de bonis non, to bring such suits, I should have thought that during an attendance at the bar of fifteen *years, and a service in the Court of Chancery of twelve, I should sometimes have met with bills of this kind. Yet this is the first that I have the least recollection of ever having- seen. I am equally free to admit, that I have never known a suit brought by creditors against the representative of an executor or administrator, for waste committed by him. In stating my own experience, I would by no means be understood to doubt the accuracy of those, who say they have known this practice, but merely to question whether it has been of such wide extent, or frequent occurrence, as to entitle it to be called the settled practice of the country. But, admit that such is the practice; yet, when this tribunal is called upon to declare the law, I apprehend that such practice deserves so much weight only, as to insure a close and attentive examination of the foundation on which it rests, and a determination not to disturb it, unless we are convinced that it is in violation of law. But, if we be so convinced, then, I hold, that however general, however ancient the error, we are bound by the highest of all sanctions, to correct it with an unshrinking hand; for, to this Court is confided the duty of expounding the law in the last resort.\nIn the discussion of this question, I will enquire: 1st. What is the law in that country from which we derive the general features of our system. 2d. Whether our own statutes have altered the law as settled there.\n1. Testaments are of high antiquity, coeval with the first rudiments of the law. When a person dies without disposing of his personal property, he is said to die intestate; and in such cases, it was said (though this is doubted in 1 Com. Dig. 491,) that by the old law, the King was entitled to seize upon the goods as parens patriae. The Crown invested the prelates with this branch of its prerogative, upon the intendment of law saith Perkins, that spiritual men are of better consciences than laymen, and have more knowledge what things would conduce to the benefit of the soul of the deceased. The goods of intestates *being thus vested in the ordinary, he might give or sell them, and dispose of the money in pios usus, being, as to this the King\u2019s Almoner. For their conduct in the discharge of this solemn trust, the reverend prelates were accountable to God and their own consciences only. They abused their trust most iniquitously; taking to themselves the whole of the property, after the partes rationabiles (two thirds) of the wife and children were deducted, and leaving the debts unpaid. To remedy this abuse, the Statute of Westminster, 2d Chap. 19, enacted, that the ordinary should be bound to answer the debts of the intestate, so far as his goods would extend. Though this bound them to pay the debts, the residuum still remained in their hands, till the Statute of 31st Edw. 3, chap. 11, took that, together with the administration, from them ; enacting, that in cases of intestacy, the ordinary shall depute the nearest and most lawful friends of the deceased, to administer his goods; which deputies the statute places on the same footing with executors, with regard to suits and accounting. This is the origin of administrators, who were only the officers of the ordinary, appointed in pursuance of this statute.\nThe 21st Hen. 8, chap. 5, enlarges a little the power of the ordinary, permitting him to grant administration, either to the widow or the next of kin, or both, at his discretion ; and where two or more are in the same degree, to appoint which he pleases. An executor being the creature of the will, and his power founded on the special confidence of the deceased, he is allowed to transmit that power to another, in whom he has equal confidence. The executor of A\u2019s executor, therefore, is to all intents and purposes, the executor and representative of A. himself. But the administrator, being merely the officer of the ordinary, prescribed to him by law, and in whom the deceased had reposed no trust at all, could not transmit his office to another; but, if he died before closing his administration, it resulted back to the ordinaryr to appoint him a successor. *So, too, when an executor died intestate, his administrator did not represent the testator; and in this case also, it devolved on the ordinary to commit administration afresh, with the will annexed. It is the officer thus appointed, whose powers we are now to examine.\nHe is appointed to finish a business already commenced. It is not, therefore, a full and immediate administration which is committed to him, such as is granted to a temporary administrator; but an administration de bonis non administratis. Between himself and his predecessor, there was no privity. His commission gave him power to act, and to represent the testator or intestate, so far, (and so far only,) as there remained unadministered \u201cgoods, chattels and credits, which were of the testator or intestate, at the time of his death.\u201d This definition turns our minds at once to the question, what amounts to an administration of assets, so far as regards the administrator de bonis non. Executors and administrators took the legal title to the goods and chatt\u00e9ls of the deceased ; nor were they, before the Statute of Distributions, 22d and 23d, Char. 2d, (1670,) bound to distribute the surplus after the payment of debts and legacies. Both held in autre droit; and therefore, neither could dispose by will of the property remaining in specie; but both had the power, while living, of changing, altering, and converting the property; and whatever was thus altered or converted, became their own goods, and descended, on their deaths, to their own representative. Such change or conversion of the goods, was, (so far as regarded the administrator de bonis non,) a complete administration, and put them as effectually beyond the reach of his commission, as if they had never belonged to the testator or intestate. To shew that this is so settled in England, I will cite a few out of a vast multitude of cases.\nIn 2 P. Wms. 340, Attorney General v. Hooker, Lord Chancellor King said, \u201cAs to what has. been urged, that if an executor dies intestate, all the personal estate, the property whereof is not altered, shall . go to the administrator *de bonis non, and not to the next of kin of the executor. This is true; because, from the time the executor dies intestate, the first testator dies intestate also, and it was the executor\u2019s own fault, that he did not, as he might, alter the property.\u201d\nIn Rutland v. Rutland, 2 P. Wms. 210, the same doctrine is explicitly laid down.\nIn 1 Bos. & Bull. \u201d310, Tangry v. Brown, C. J. Eyre, and the Court say, \u201cthatevery thing is unadministered, which has not been reduced into . actual possession, and converted by the administrator.\u201d\n3 Bac. Abr. 20, tit. \u201cExecutors,\u201d it is said, \u201cthat an administrator de bonis non is entitled to all the goods and personal estate, such as terms for years, household goods, &c. which remain in specie, and were not administered by the first administrator; as also, to all debts due the intestate.\u201d\nIn Wankford v. Wankford, 1 Salk. 306, C. J. Holt, after laying down the rule that the same hand having to pay and to receive, is an extinguishment, puts this case: \u201cIf the executrix of the obligee take the obligor to husband, that is no extin-guishment; for he may pay her money, as executrix, and she lay this money so paid her by itself, the administrator de bonis non of her testator, (if she die intestate,) shall have that money, as well as any other goods that were the testator\u2019s; for, (says he,) if the goods of the testator rpmain in specie, they shall go to the administrator de bonis non, because in that case, it is notorious, which were the goods of the testator, and they are distinguishable; and there is the same reason where money is kept by itself, and the husband permits it so to be; but if the husband seizes it, it will be his, and will be a devastavit.\u201d\nBarker v. Talcot, 1 Vern. 473. If A. die intestate, and his son take out administration to him, and receive part of a debt being arrear to the intestate, and accepts a promissory note for the residue, and then dies intestate; this acceptance of the note is such an alteration of the property, *as vests it in the son, and therefore, on his death, it shall go to his administrator, and not to the administrator de bonis non.\u201d\nBeaumont v.- Bong, Sir W. Jones\u2019s Rep. 248. 1 \u2018Baron and Berne, administratrix of a former husband, recover a debt due- to the intestate; the Feme dies and the Baron sues out a sci.- fac. to which the defendant demurs. Per Curiam. The action does not'lie,- because the recovery-does not convert' this to the proper debt of the-Baron ; as it -would be, if the Baron and -Feme recovered a debt due to the Feme, and then the Feme had- died;-for there, by the recovery, it has become the proper debt of the Baron, if he survive; but here it remains the debt of the intestate, and of him who shall be his administrator.\u201d \u25a0\nThese -are a few of the many cases scattered through the Reports of the last three centuries, shewing the settled course of the law. I might bring to my aid many others, where the contest was between the representative of the administrator, and the administrator de bonis non; and the question uniformly turned upon the point of conversion ; all agreeing that a conversion extinguished the right of the administrator de bonis non, as it was an administration, and his commission reached only to the goods and credits un-administered. Sometimes equity will follow the property, where at law, there might be said to be a conversion,; as, if the first administrator\u2019vested money of his intestate, in the funds, or transferred it from one fund to another. This, as it shewed no intention of making the money his own, would not be considered, in equity, a conversion. - Sometimes there will be a conversion in equity, where none exists at law; that is, where some act is done by the administrator, shewing a clear intent to convert. These differences result from the different modes of administering justice in the two systems; and do not, in the least, affect the question ; for, before whichever forum the case is brought, if it be decided that the subject matter of dispute has been converted, that is regarded as decisive to *shew, that the administrator de bonis non has no power over it. In addition to all this, the statute of 30th Ch. 2, ch. 7, explained and perpetuated by the 4th and 5th Wm. & Mary, expressly declares, in its preamble, \u201cthat executors and administrators of executors and administrators, for want of privity, were not before answerable, nor could be sued, for debts due by the first testator or intestate, notwithstanding such executors or administrators had wasted the estate of the first testator;\u201d and to remedy this evil, it makes such second executors or administrators chargeable. How? To the administrator de bonis non? No; but chargeable \u201cin the same manner as the first executor or administrator should or might have been;\u201d that is, liable directly to the creditors, \u201cwho,\u201d (as Sergeant Williams, in a learned note on this statute, 1 Saund. 219, e, says,) \u201cmay sustain an action against them, in every case, where the executor, in his lifetime, was in any way guilty of ally act, which amounts in law to a devastavit, such as exhausting the assets by the payment of debts of inferior degree, before those of a superior, and the like.\u201d This review shews us, that in all contests for the property of the intestate, between the administrator. de bonis non, and the representative of the first administrator, a conversion has uniformly been held to withdraw the goods from the administrator de bo\u00f1is non : that the statutes declare the second executor or administrator not suable for the devastavit of the first; and that the statute making them thenceforward suable, does not give power to the administrator de bonis non to.sue them; but gives it to the creditors.\nTo meet this formidable array, what is there on the other side? Not one single case; not the dictum of a single Judge; not the assertion of an elementary writer, that the administrator de bonis non, either at law pr in equity, can support an action, or file a bill for account, against the representative of a delinquent executor or administrator. This absence of authority alone, is conclusive evidence, that in England, such a right was never claimed.\n*Thelaw of executors and administrators came to this colonv, as thus settled, by the mother country ; and we are now to enquire, how it has been affected by our own legislation. A minute examination into our early laws, would be rather matter of curiosity, than of useful application to this case; for the question here must be governed by the revisa! of 1819, which repeals every law not re-enacted by it. I will, however, take a brief notice of some of our early statutes.\nThe probate of wills, and granting administration, which belonged to the ordinary in England, was given to our Courts. At first, it seems that the Court of James City (the General Court I presume) performed these functions for the whole colony. In 1645, (20th Ch. 1st; 1 Hen. Stat. at Large, 302, (there is a statute, which, stating that theretofore the estates of deceased persons had been much wronged by the great charge and expenses which have been brought in by administrators, by pretence of their attendance at James City, &c., for remedy thereof, &c., enacts that all administrations shall be granted at the County Courts, where the deceased resided, and all probates of wills there made, &c.\nThe next Act which it is material to notice, is one passed in March, 1661-2, (14th Ch. 2d; 2 Hen. Stat. at Large, 91.) It is headed \u201cAdministrations, to whom to be granted,\u201d and relates solely to that subject. The recital states, that commissions of administrations had been suddenly disposed of, under pretence of greatest creditor, or next of kin, and thereby the persons really entitled defrauded; and enacts, \u201cthat no administration shall be granted for nine months, except to the widow or child.\u201d In case of no wife or child, then it is enacted, \u201cthat the estate be, by the Court, sold at > public outcry, the purchasers putting in security, and acknowledging judgments for their debts, which the Court shall assign to the several creditors,\u201d according to their priorities; the surplusage to be held three years, for any who will prove himself next of *k<n ; \u201cand if none prove himself such within that time, the Court to give an account of the surplus, to the Assembly, to be disposed of by them for the use of the country.\u201d This law clearly dispenses altogether with the appointment of an administrator, where the decedent leaves neither wife nor child. A subsequent part of this law, (it is not, as the modern practice is, laid off into sections) states, \u201cAnd whereas, it hath been the frequent evil practice of administrators, as soon as they have obtained an order to administer, to actas administrator, by virtue of that order, without giving security, or taking out their commissions, so that the estate being embezzled away, no account can be given thereof: Be it therefore enacted, that whoever pretends to administer upon any estate, shall bring into the Court sufficient security, before the order shall be granted ; and an order thus obtained legally, by giving such security to be truly accomptable, to bring in a true inventory, and to perform such things as the administrators by law are enjoined, shall not, at any time, be reversed, unless the party that obtained the same, die before he hath given an account of the estate, and obtained his quietus; in which case, the Court is empowered to grant the administration of the estate so not ac-compted for to some other person, who may by virtue thereof, call the heirs, executors or administrators of the former administrator to an account, who shall pay out of the said deceased administrator\u2019s estate all such debts as shall be found d\"e to the estate he administered upon, in the first place.\u201d\nI have given this statute nearly entire, that we mav the better judge of it. It contains a striking departure from the established law ; for it will be recollected, that it was passed eight years before the Statute of Distributions; and a much longer time before the Statutes of-Charles and William & Mary, subjecting executors and administrators of executors and administrators to the suits of' creditors. It does I not touch the case of executors, but goes to a radical change of the existing law of *administrators. That law granted to the administrator de bonis non, a partial administration of the goods and credits unadministered. This seems to contemplate a full administration ; for it is, that if the party die before he hath given an account of the estate, the former order of administration shall be reversed, and administration shall be granted of \u201cthe estate,\u201d (the whole estate,) \u201cso not accounted for.\u201d The administrator, then, is not an administrator de bonis non admin-istratis, but of the whole estate; and the Act is careful to vest in him the power \u201cby virtue thereof,\u201d to call the heirs, executors or administrators of the former administrator to account. As he was made administrator of the whole estate, it was certainly proper that he should have power over the whole; but it could not have been necessary for the law to give him power to call the representative of his predecessor to account, by virtue thereof, if such power existed independent of, the law. This provision, then, is clear proof that the Legislature who passed the law, understood that a second administrator could not, as the law then stood, call the representative of a former administrator to account. It is veryr clear to me, that if this Act of 1661-2 were in force when the case before us arose, it governed it, and gave the right to bring the bill; but it is equally clear to my understanding, that the Act was not then in force. In 1705, (4th Anne, 3 Hen. Stat. at Large, 371,) we have an Act, \u201cLor distribution of intestates\u2019 estates, &c.,\u201d which is nearly a copy (so far as I have been able to compare them,) of the 22d and 23d of Charles 2. This Act unquestionably repealed so much of the Act of 1661, as disposed of the estate of intestates, where there was no wife or child, by making, in such cases, a different disposition of the estate.\n, In 1711, (9th Anne, 4 Hen. Stat. at Large, 12,) we find \u201can Act directing the manner of granting probates of wills and administration of intestates\u2019 estates.\u201d This Act treats these subjects very much at large, and with *much more legal science than the former. It not only goes into the details, so necessary to clearness, but prescribes the forms of the bonds to be given in all cases. When it comes to speak on the subject of unfinished administrations, it says, \u201cAnd if it shall so happen, that any executor shall die intestate, not having fully performed his executor-ship; or any administrator shall depart this life, not having fully administered the goods of his intestate; in every such case, it shall and may be lawful for the Court that granted the certificate for obtaining such probate or commission of administration, to hear and determine the right of administration, and to grant certificate for obtaining letters of administration, of the goods not administered, to such person as by this Act shall have right thereto.\u201d\nNow, I,say, that .this Act repealed the statute of 1661. The provisions of the two Acts are inconsistent with each other. The first, in case the party dies before he obtains his quietus, - reverses the former order of administration, and grants de novo complete administration of the whole estate; the second, where the administrator dies, not having fully administered, grants administration \u201cof the goods not administered\u201d only. The former gives the second administrator power to call the heirs, executors or administrators of the first, to account; and this was necessary; for, as he had to account for all the estate, he ought to have the power to call it all in. The latter law gives no power to the second administrator to call the representative of the first to account; and for this there was no need, as he had to do only with the goods unadministered. When the Legislature used these words, their meaning had been perfectly fixed and settled; and we are bound to suppose that they used them in the sense which such a numerous train of decisions had affixed to them. This law, then, would repeal the former, upon the ground that leges posteriores, priores contrarias abrogant. But it has also a repealing clause, most strongly and emphatically expressed; that *\u201call and every other Act and Acts, and every clause and article thereof, heretofore made, for so much thereof as relates to any matter or thing whatsoever, within the purview of this Act, is and are hereby repealed and made void, to all intents and purposes, as if the same had never been made.\u201d I conclude, then, that this Act repealed the former.\nThe repeal of the Act of 1661-2, restored things to the standing here, which, X have shewn, existed before its passage. That this was the Legislative understanding of the matter in 1730, is most clear from an Act then passed, in which they say, \u201cWhereas executors and administrators of such persons as possess themselves of personal estates of other dead persons, and convert the same to their own use, are not liable, by the rules of the common law, as it now stands in this colony, .to pay the debts of such persons, whose estates have been so converted by their testator or intestate; for remedy whereof: Be it enacted, that all executors and administrators of any executor in his own wrong, and all executors or administrators of any executor or administrator .of right, who shall waste or convert to his own use, goods, &c. of his testator or intestate, shall, from henceforth,.be liable and chargeable, in the same manner as his testator or intestate should or might have *been.\u201d Here we see the mischief clearly expressed, and the remedy as plainly applied; a mischief, which could not have existed, and a remedy worse than useless, because tending to create confusion, if the statute of 1661-2 had been in force.\nSeveral other Acts were mentioned in the argument, those of 1785 and 1814, particularly ; but really it seems so clear to me that they were intended to meet the particular mischief stated in them, and have no influence on the question before us, that I do not think it worth while to add to this opinion, (already too long,) by a further notice of them.\nIt will be observed, that I have not compared the conveniences and inconveniences of the two constructions contended for. In doubtful questions, this may be very well; but where the law is clear, (as it seems to me in this case,) the Court have nothing to do (I think) with these considerations. That the law is so, is enough for us. If it be inconvenient, or operate injustice, the Legislature must interfere.\nI shall only add, th\u00e1t in the revisal ofl819, 1 R. C. 390, sec. 66, th\u00e9 law as stated above, taken from the Act of 1730, is re-enacted, whereby the administrator of an administrator who has wasted the assets, is made liable and chargeable, in the same manner as his intestate was; in other words, liable to the creditors, and not to the administrator de bonis non.\nI am therefore of opinion, that the administrator de bonis non cannot maintain a bill in equity, calling the administrator of the administrator to account, for any waste or conversion of his intestate.\nJUDGE GREEN.\nIt was determined in Dykes v. Wood-house, 3 Rand. 287, that an administrator de bonis non, was entitled to'a scire' facias to revive a judg entin favor of a deceased executor *or administrator, for a debt due to the testator or intestate; because such judgment did not, as was admitted in the English Courts, convert the property of the debt, or amount to an. administration. The administrator de bonis non is bound by, and entitled to, the benefit of such judgment; and for the same reason, he is entitled to appeal, or to prosecute an appeal from any decree or judgment against the former executor or administrator, or administrator de bonis non, binding or affecting any subject belonging to the testator or intestate; the right to which, but for such decree or judgment, would have devolved on the administrator de bonis non. The party aggrieved, or any one standing, by operation of law, in his place, is entitled to prosecute such appeal.\nThe original plaintiff in the Court below, could not, in his character of administrator de bonis non of Wernick (in which character only he sued,) reach the fund in the hands of M\u2019Murdo, unless he was entitled, in that character, to call the representative of the former administrator to account, and to be substituted to the rights of Wernick\u2019s creditors and distributees, and of the sureties of the first administrator, in respect to the fund deposited with Douglas, by the first administrator, for the indemnity of his sureties.\nThe question, whether an administrator de bonis non can call the representative of a deceased executor or administrator to account in a Court of Equity, for the assets of the testator or intestate, wasted or converted to his own use by such executor or administrator, deserves a full examination ; since it has never yet, as far as I am informed, occurred in this Court, except in the case of Spotswood v. Dandridge, decided in a Special Court; and in that case, the question does not appear to have been discussed, but to have passed sub silentio.\nAt the common law, an administrator was the mere bailiff of the ordinary, responsible only to him. The next of kin had no legal or equitable claim to distribution; but *the ordinary distributed the assets in pios usus, at his pleasure. 11 Vin. Abr. 52, pi. 1, n. ; Palmer v. Alcock, 3 Mod. 56; Skinner, 219, S. C. It has been even doubted, whether the ordinary was responsible to creditors; a doubt removed by the statute of Westm. 2, which required the ordinary to pay the debts. 18 H. 6, 23, b ; 5 Rep. 83, Snelling\u2019s Case. Nor could the ordinary or administrator sue for the debts due to the intestate. 8 Rep. 135, Sir John Needham\u2019s Case. The statute of 31st Edw. 3, ch. 11, made it the duty of the ordinary to commit the administration to the next and most loyal friends of the intestate, who might sue for the debts due to the intestate, and be answerable as executor. 11 Vin. Abr. 91, pi. 1; and the statute of 21 H. 8, ch. 5, sect. 3, directed that in case of intestacy, or the executor\u2019s refusing, administration should be committed to the widow or next of kin, or both, at the discretion of the ordinary; and if divers persons were in equality of kindred, he might accept one or more. Ibid. pi. 2. These statutes deprived the ordinary of the power of displacing administrators at pleasure, which he had at the common law. 11 Vin. Abr. 52, pi. 1, n ; 70, pi. 7; 115, pi. 15. But, he still took bonds from the administrators, and compelled them to make distribution at his pleasure, Sadler v. Daniel, 10 Mod. 21; until about the 12th of James 1st, when it was determined upon the construction of the statute of H. 8, that an administrator was not bound to make any distribution of the surplus, even although the intestate had children under age, or beyond sea, and administration was granted to a stranger; and prohibitions issued to prevent the ordinary from compelling such distribution. 11 Vin. Abr. 52, pi. 1, n; 183, pi. 1; 357, pi. 2; Hughes v. Hughes, Lev. 233.\nBefore the Statute of Distributions of the 22d and 23d of Charles 2, (1670,) an executor was not compellable in any case, to make distribution of any surplus of the \u25a0 assets remaining after the payment of debts and legacies; so that an executor and administrator had precisely the same interest *in the testator\u2019s goods; not an absolute interest, as they held in autre droit, but such an interest as that no other except creditors, in case of intestacy, or creditors and legatees, in case of a will and executor, could claim any thing against them, in respect to the assets of the testator or intestate, which came to their hands. The nature of this interest was such, that although the executor or administrator was entitled to the goods, chattels and credits of the testator or intestate, so that no one, (except creditors and legatees as aforesaid,) could claim against them during their lives; yet, upon their deaths, testate or intestate, all the testator\u2019s of intestate\u2019s goods, chattels and credits, remaining in kind, still belong to the estate of the testator or intestate; that is, (in the language of the letters testamentary, or commission of administration,) they were \u201cthe goods, chattels and credits of the testator or intestate at the time of his death.\u2019' Neither the executor or administrator could dispose of such by his will. 11 Vin. Abr. 109, pi. 3; 421, pi. 6; 267, pi. 6. They remained, as at the death of the testator or intestate, without a proprietor, and it devolved on the ordinary to give them an owner, by appointing an administrator \u201cde bonis non administratis\u201d by the former executor or administrator, or by granting probate of the will of the first executor to his executor; the effect of which was, to make the second executor the immediate executor of the first testator, as if he was appointed executor by his will. 11 Vin. Abr. 421, pi. 6; 267, pi. 6. But, the executor or administrator had the power, and if it did not injure creditors or legatees, the right also to make the goods, chattels and credits of the testator or intestate, their own, by converting them to their own use, by destroying their identity and changing their character; and whatever was so converted, no longer remained any part of \u201cthe goods, chattels and credits, which were of the testator or intestate, at the time of his death.\u201d\nIn this state of things, it was necessary, and within the original reason of granting administrations, to grant an administration *of the goods and chattels remaining in kind. But, there was no reason to grant to another a power to call upon the executor or administrator of the deceased executor or administrator, for an account and payment of any balance of the assets converted to his own use. The payment of legacies was compelled in the Ecclesiastical Court exclusively, (11 Vin. Abr. 358, pi. 7, note;) until Lord Nottingham first assumed the jurisdiction in Chancery, upon the ground that the executor was a trustee for the legatees; and before the Statute of Distributions, and whilst the ordinary exercised the power to compel distribution at his pleasure, that jurisdiction was also exercised exclusively in the Ecclesiastical Courts. Toll. Law of Executors, 489. But, creditors never had remedy in the Ecclesiastical Court and only had it in Courts of common law. As to creditors, after the death of an executor or administrator, they had no remedy against his representative for!\"a devastavit, at common law, it being a tort, which died with the person. 11 Vin. Abr. 309, pi. 1; 310, pi. 7, 8. Nor were they ever held to have a remedy in Chancery, until three years before the statute of 30 Ch. 2, chap. 7, sec. 2, (which gave a .remedy at law against the executor or administrator of an executor de son tort;) when it was said that such a remedy might be had against such an executor in equity; and two years after, and one year before the statute,- it was held that the same remedy might be had in equity against an executor of a rightful executor. 11 Vin. Abr. 310, pi. 9; pi. :3, sec. 6; pi. 10. The bond given by the administrator could be used against the executor or administrator of the deceased administrator only for the purposes of enforcing that which was within the proper jurisdiction of the ordinary to enforce, the returning of an account, and a distribution at his pleasure; not to enforce the payment of debts, as was after-wards determined, when the Courts of law adjudged that the bond was void, so far as it bound the administrator to distribute, but good, so far as it bound him to render an account; the latter . subject *being within, and the former without, the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Court. 11 Vin. Abr. 183, pi. 1; 358, pi. 7, note. It was therefore more convenient, (as no one was interested in the recovery to be had against the executor or administrator of the administrator, but those designated by the ordinary as dis-tributees,) that the remedy should be had immediately for thei\u2019- benefit, and in their names, and' paid to them at once, than that it should go into the hands .of the succeeding administrator (although he might be. one of the designated distributees) to be afterwards distributed, perhaps after a suit against him. But after it was determined, that the ordinary had no power to compel any distribution, it would have been absurd to hold that the-executor of a deceased administrator was liable to account to the administrator de bonis non for the assets converted by the .first administrator; for, then the fund would have devolved from administrator de bonis non to administrator de bonis non forever, and could .have been of no use to any one. So, in respect to executors dying intestate, creditors had no remedy in respect to the assets converted to his own use or wasted; and the ordinary never had power to compel any distribution whatever, in the case of an executor. Such effect had the appointment of an executor, that before, the statute of 21 Hen. 8, (which directed administration to be committed to the wife or the next of kin in case of intestacy,)-that if an executor died intestate, \u2022 the ordinary might, ..and ought to commit the administration de. bonis non of the executor and of the first testator, to the same person.- Br.- Abr.. \u201cAdministrator,\u201d pi. 45, cites -32 H. 6; 2 Lib. Int. 145; 21 Edw. 4, 24; 11 Vin. Abr.. 88, pi. 1\u00bb The statute of 31 Edw. 3, having directed the administration to be committed to the next and most loyal friend,-the executor-was considered as designated by the testator as such; and the unadministered assets should therefore go quasi his,.to the next and most-loyal friend of the executor. This doctrine was held as late as the 30th Char. 2,.11 Vin. *Abr. 90, 11. -But it- was otherwise held, both before and after this last case, and- -particularly after the Statute of Distributions, and that-l administration de bonis . non should be granted to the next of kin of the testator, under the Statute of 21 H. 8, the testator being dead.intestate as to all the assets not administered bj\u2019 the executor; that is,'not converted. 11 Vin. Abr. 89, pi. 8; 87, pi. 23, (1721;) 111, pi. 20, 21, (1723, 1725;) 11 Vin. Abr. 88, pi. 1. The same doctrine, founded upon the Statute of 21 H. 8, was suggested by* Brooke, in his abridgment.\nIt was for these reasons, that no rights were given to the administrator de bonis non against the former executor or administrator, and his commission was so framed as to shew accurately the extent of his rights, by committing to him the administration,-de bonis non administratis by the former executor or administrator; which entitled him to no more than the goods, chattels and credits, remaining in . specie, or although changed, yet capable of being identified as the proceeds . of the goods, chattels or credits of the testator or intestate; not intended to be converted by the executor or administrator; as money collected and kept separate by the executor or administrator; lands extended in a suit by the executor or administrator, in satisfaction of a debt due to the testator. 3 Bac. Abr. -19, 20; Wankford v. Wankford, 1 Salk. 306; 11 Vin. Abr. 108, pi. 2; 112, pi. 4. In equity, money might be recovered by the administrator of an executor, upon a judgment recovered by the executor for goods of the testator taken from the executor; Yate v. Gough, Yelv. 33; or if the executor should, for the benefit of the estate, invest part of it in the funds, or transfer it from one particular stock to another, this was not a conversion or appropriation, but it might still be \u2022 followed as assets, for the nature of the case required it. Waite v. Whorewood, 2 Atk. 159. - In these cases, the fund can be identified, like money kept separate; and there was no intention on the part of the executor, to convert it to his own use, and therefore the fund in these cases, as in *the case of a judgment unsatisfied, in favor of an executor, for a debt originally due to the testator, remains assets of the testator not administered by the executor.\nAfter the determination that an administrator could not be compelled to make distribution, the rights of an executor.and administrator were precisely - the same. Neither was accountable for assets wasted or-converted to his own use,, except to creditors, and (in the case of a will) to legatees, in their life-time; and to - legatees only-, after their deaths. Their representatives had no interest in the assets -unadminis-tered; but, these went - to the administrator de bonis non, or the executor of the executor, - who held them as the assets of the testator or intestate, chargeable, in respect-to such assets, as, the-, executor or administrator was chargeable-whilst he held them, and no further. Opon their, deaths, the same consequences followed-, as upon-the-deaths of ,th'e executor or admin-istra tor,-and no other\u00bb\nIt was argued, that -after the - Statute of Distributions,- the -administrator, in all cases, and the executor, in some cases, being compellable to make-distribution of the surplus of the assets which came to their hands to be administered; and as their representatives were exempted from responsibility to the administrator de bonis non for goods converted by the executor or administrator, in the life-time of the executor or administrator, in respect to the beneficial power over the assets, which the executor and administrator had before that statute; and as, since the statute, the representative of the executor or administrator Is responsible, for the goods so converted, to some one; that responsibility should be to the administrator de bonis non, as trustee for the distributees; and that the reason of the former rule having failed, the rule also failed.\nBefore the Statute of Distributions, and whilst the ordinary compelled distribution, the same reason existed for holding the representative of a deceased administrator liable to the administrator de bonis non, for the goods converted, *as exists since the statute; yet such liability never existed, and would not have been convenient to any purpose, for the reasons before stated. The administrator de bonis non, after the statute, was a trustee for distributees, and a representative of the testator or intestate, only to the extent of the goods, chattels and credits, unadmin-istered. Such was the effect of the commission to the administrator de bonis non, both before and after the statute. No alteration was made in the form of the commission, inconsequence of the statute; nor was the statute ever held, in England, to have varied or enlarged the rights of the administrator de bonis non. No case has never occurred in England, in which an administrator de bonis non has ever asserted a claim against the representative of a deceased executor or administrator, at law or in equity, for an account of the assets wasted or converted to his own use, by the executor or administrator; and consequently, no adjudged case is to be found expressly denying or affirming the propriety of such a claim. Nor do I find any direct dictum to the point, one way or the other. This is only to be accounted for, by the supposition that it never occurred to any one there, that there was any foundation in law or equity, for such a claim; otherwise, cases must have occurred, in which it would have been necessary to decide that point; and, if such a right existed, it is impossible that there should not be found many instances of its having been asserted, in the reports of the decisions of the English Courts. The various questions which must have arisen in the prosecution of such claims, could not have escaped the attention, of all the reporters and elementary writers. There is, however, abundant evidence in the adjudged cases, found in the English books, to shew that no such right existed, either, before or after the Statute of Distributions.\nI have already noticed the cases at law and in equity, in which the question has been.between the executor or administrator of an executor or- administrator, and the administrator de bonis,non, as to their respective rights to , particular ^subjects; many of which were subsequent to the Statute of Distributions, and in which the right of the administrator de bonis non to the particular subject, has been sustained, upon the ground that it was not converted, nor the property altered, or if altered at law, not altered in the contemplation of a Court of Equity ; because the executor or administrator did not intend, by such alteration, to convert it to his own use. Other cases have occurred, where the same question has arisen in the Courts of Law and Equity, and has been determined in favour of the representative of the deceased executor or administrator, upon the ground that the subject of controversy had been administered or converted, and the property changed at law; and even when not changed at law, yet altered in the contemplation of a Court of Equity, by the act of the executor or administrator, with intent to convert it. Thus, an administrator, possessed of a term of his intestate, makes a lease for years of a part of it, reserving a rent, and makes his executor and dies; the executor of the administrator is entitled to the rent, and not the administrator de bonis non of the intestate. Dunn v. Baylie, Freeman\u2019s Rep. 392; Vent. 295; 2 Lev. 100; Noel v. Robinson, Vern. 94. The cases in equity of Butler v. Baker, Ch. Cas. 224, (1673,) and an anonymous case in 2 Vent. 362, (1683,) strongly illustrate these doctrines. The first of those cases was thus: \u201cAdministrator mortgages a term of the intestate\u2019s and makes A. his executor, and dies. B. takes administration de bonis non of the first intestate, and claims the residuary interest and trust in the term, and prays redemption. But, redemption was decreed to A., the executor of the first administrator, who had aliened the whole estate in law, of the term, and was not possessed in autre droit, nor of any part of the interest thereof, but in his own right; and so it shall go to his executor, and not to B. the administrator de bonis non.\u201d\nThe other case was thus: Administrator of theconusee of a statute, had agreed with the conusor to assign, in consideration *of a sum of money, which, upon agreement, the conusor had covenanted to pay to him, his executors or administrators. Administrator died. Decreed the money, to be paid to the executor of the administrator, and not to the administrator de bonis non; although, before the extent, it could not be assigned at law, no debts of the first intestate appearing.\nThese cases were after the Statute of Distributions. In the last case, the legal title to the statute belonged to the administrator de bonis non; and if debts of the first intestate had appeared, it is intimated that the equitable title of the executor of the administrator would not have prevailed against this legal, title. Yet, the subject .was liable to be brought into distribution, with any assets converted by the administrator.\nIf. the representative of a deceased : tor or administrator was liable administrat.or de bonis non, for the assets .converted, upon what., principle could the equity of redemption, in the first case, be decreed to the executor of the administra tor? That he might receive the money, merely to account .for it to the administrator de bonis non, a party in the very cause in which that decree was made? And upon what principle could the equitable right of the executor of -the administrator, in the last case, prevail, against the legal title of the administrator de bonis non, if the money paid to the first was to be accounted for .to the last?\nIt was suggested in the argument, that the first administrator may have been a creditor of the intestate, and therefore entitled to the fund to satisfy his claim. If so, he must have asserted that ground of claim, or the Court could not have presumed it; or if, on the other hand, he was a dpbtor to the estate, that fact would have been alleged to support the claim of the administrator de bonis non. But, no enquiry was made as to the fact, whether the deceased executor or administrator was a creditor or debtor of the estate, in any case; a proof, I think, that the fact had no influence, in any way, upon the rights of the parties.\n* Again: If an administrator de bonis non had such \u00e1 right as is now claimed, upon the best settled principles of a Court of Equity, legatees and distrib-utees could not proceed in equity against the executor or administrator of a deceased executor or administrator, without making the administrator de bonis nona party; for, if he had the right claimed, he would be entitled to the.assets converted, for the payment of debts, before the legatees and distributees could be entitled to anything. In that case, if there was no administrator de bonis non, the Court should not proceed in the suit, until one was appointed, and was brought before the Court. As, in the case of an executor de son tort, it, is said, \u2018 \u2018There is no precedent in a Court of Equity of a decree against him, without setting up an administrator; for, if there should be an administrator, and the defendant pay the money, he would be again liable to the administrator.\u201d Edlows v. Deane, Bunb. 36. Yet, in the numerous cases cited in the argument, in which the legatees and distributees prosecuted suits against the representatives of deceased executors or administrators, for the assets converted, the administrator de bonis non was not a party, nor was the necessity that he should be a party suggested. 11 Vin. Abr. 420, pl. 4; 427, pl. 11; 423, pl. 18; Orr v. Mann, 2 Ves. 194. The rule is accurately laid down by BQrd Chancellor King, in Swann v. Hooker, 2 Wms. Rep, 340, (1725.) \u201cIf an executor dies intestate, all the personal estate, the property whereof is not altered, shall go to the administrator de bonis non, and not to the next of kin of the executor; and this is true; for, from the time the executor dies intestate, the first testator dies intestate also; and it .was the executor\u2019s own fault, that he did not, as . he might, alter the property.\u201d\nThere are other considerations, arising out of well settled principles of law, which lead irresistibly to the conclusion that an administrator de bonis non had not a right in equity, either before or after the Statute of Distributions, to claim satisfaction from the representative of an *executor or administrator, for assets wasted or converted to his use. Creditors, at common law, had no action against the executor or administrator of an executor or administrator, who had wasted or converted the assets to h\u00abs own use; and in equity, a remedy was not allowed in such cases, until after the Statute of Distributions, and a little before the English Statutes gave a remedy in that case, at law. Now, such a remedy at law or in equity, would have been utterly superfluous, and the want of it could never have been felt, if the representative of a deceased executor or administrator was accountable to the administrator de bonis non, for the assets wasted or converted. The fund would have passed into his hands; and then, as assets in his hands to be administered, would have been liable to creditors. If he failed to coerce the payment, it would be a devastavit, like the failure to collect any other debt, and he would be liable for the amount to creditors, as if it had been actually received.\nIt has been seen, that an executor of an executor has precisely the same rights in respect to the assets of the first testator, which an administrator de bonis non has; that is, to all the goods, chattels and credits, not administered by the first executory and an executor or administrator, who represents both the debtor and creditor, may retain the assets, which he has as executor or administrator of the debtor, for the satisfaction of the debt due to him, as executor or administrator, of the creditor. 11 Vin. Abr. 261, pl. 3; Burdett v. Pin, 2 Brownl. 50. If then, the administrator de bonis non, who was. also executor or administrator of the deceased executor or administrator, or the executor of an executor, were: entitled to claim against the estate of the first executor or administrator, for the assets of the first testator or intestate, converted to their use or wasted, it would be their duty to retain out of the assets of the-executor or administrator in their hands, the whole amount due to them for such conversion or waste, as administrator de bonis non or executor of the first testator *or intestate; and the claim would be extinguished by operation of law, the instant the right and obligation concurred in the same persons. In such case,, there never could have been any necessity for a Court of Equity to give relief to creditors against the representative of a deceased executor or administrator, upon the ground that they had no remedy at law; nor any occasion for the statute which gave them a remedy at law. It would have been absurd to allow to legatees and distributees a remedy in equity, against the representatives of the deceased executor; for, the debt of the deceased executor would be in the hands of the executor of the executor, as executor of the first testator, liable to creditors and legatees, and that before any a suit could possibly be brought.\nAgain: An executor, before the Statute of Distributions, was entitled to the surplus of the assets, after the payment of debts and legacies, and since the statute, unless from the terms of the will it appears that the tes-\ntator intended to exclude him from the surplus; and then he is a trustee for the next of kin. 11 Vin. Abr. 408, pi. 6, and note. He was not entitled as legatee, but as executor; so that the assets unadminis-tered went to his executor, as immediate executor of the first testator, with precisely the same rights which the first executor had. The executor could not devise the assets unadministered; and if the executor died intestate, then was the testator intestate as to the assets not converted by the executor, and they went to the next of kin of the testator, and not of the executor. 11 Vin. Abr. Ill, pi. 19-20. Thus, the right of the executor to the surplus, was virtually limited to the surplus of the assets, the property of which had been altered by his act in his life-time. If the estate of the first executor was responsible to the executor of the executor, as executor of the testator, for the assets so converted, this right to the surplus would be utterly frustrated, not only as to the first executor, but every succeeding executor ad infinitum; and after the payment of the debts and legacies of the testator, the residue *of the assets of the testator would be transmitted ad infinitum from executor to executor, each succeeding as to such assets as the executor of the testator, and the fund would never be liable for any debts of the intermediate executors. If a creditor sued the executor of the executor for the debt of the executor, the executor of the executor would say, \u201cmy testator, the executor, was indebted for goods wasted and converted, to me as executor of the first testator, in a large sum which I have retained out of the assets of my immediate testator, and no more came to my hands, than was sufficient to pay that debt;\u201d and so every succeeding executor ad infinitum. The right of an executor to the surplus, stands, in Virginia, preciselv on the same footing that it does- in England. This was certainly the case, until January 1, 1787, as was decided in Shelton v. Shelton, 1 Wash. 53, in this Court. In that case, a doubt is thrown out, whether, since the time when the act of 1785 took effect, the executor is not, by that act, deprived in all cases of the surplus. That act provides that \u201cwhen any person shall die intestate as to his goods and chattels, or any part thereof, the surplus shall be distributed.\u201d The expression, or any part thereof, was adverted to in Shelton v. Shelton, as referring to all that was not actually bequeathed. 1 cannot think that the expression had that import. A testator might die testate as to part, and intestate as to other part of his estate. 11 Vin. Abr. 79, pi. 3. As, if he appointed an executor of all his goods in Virginia, leaving goods in Maryland, he would be intestate as to all the goods in Maryland; or, was to appoint an executor of a specified part of his goods, saying nothing of the residue, tie would die intestate as to the residue; or, if his general executor died without administering or converting all his goods and chattels, the testator would be intestate as to all unadministered or unconverted, according to the cases before referred to. But, whenever a general executor was appointed, the testator was not intestate as to any part of his estate, unless the executor died without converting the *'whole; in which case, he would be intestate as to the part not converted, and it was to these cases of partial intestacy that the expression of the statute referred. All statutes should be construed, with reference to the principles of the common law; and the expression, \u201cif intestate as to a part of the estate,\u201d means intestate according to the signification of that term as used in the common law. It was not intended by the statute, to give it an entirely new signification.\nIf the administrator de bonis non had the' right now contended for, the statutes giving a remedy to creditors against the representatives of the deceased executor or administrator, for the waste or conversion of the assets, would not only have been useless for the reasons before stated, but the remi-dies of the creditors and of the administrator de bonis non, in relation to the same subject, would have been inconsistent in their effects. As respects the assets of such executor or administrator, the claim of all creditors (no matter what was their original dignity, in respect to the assets of the testator or intestate) were of equal dignity, and all ranked as simple contract debts only; and the first judgment was to be first satisfied. But, if the fund was to go into the hands of the administrator de bonis non, then the claims of creditors would rank upon the fund according to the original dignity of the debts. As against the executor or administrator of the executor or administrator, a simple contract creditor might get, by greater diligence, a preference over a bond creditor; which could not be done, as against the administrator de bonis non. If the administrator de bonis non had a right to claim the fund, the Legislature surely would not give to creditors a concurrent right to claim the same fund; the effect of which would be so totally different as to the ultimate rights of the different creditors; and that too, without any necessity.\nIt was argued that the Statutes of 30th Ch. 2, and 4th and 5th of Will. & Mary, did not give a remedy against an executor or administrator of an executor or administrator, *who had wasted or converted the assets, to any creditor, but such as had obtained a judgment against the executor or administrator in his life-time; and that, therefore, in order to provide for creditors who had not obtained judgment in the life-time of the executor or administrator, the fund should go into the hands of the administrator de bonis non, so that the creditors who had not obtained judgments might be satisfied. If this proposition were true, there was the same necessity before as since the statutes, to give the fund to the administrator de bonis non; and if that had been the law, the statute would have been unnecessary. But it seems to me, that the statute gives a right to all creditors, whether they had obtained judgments against the executor or administrator in his life-time or not, to sue the representative of the executor or administrator, and to allege in his declaration, the existence of the debt, that assets sufficient to pay it had come to the hands of the executor or administrator, and that he had wasted or converted them. This construction is necessary to give effect to the statutes. The declaration that the executor or administrator was liable, relates to the substance of the liability, and not to the mode of enforcing it. In an original suit against an executor or administrator, a devastavit cannot be put in issue, nor any thing, but whether the debt be due, and whether assets sufficient to satisfy it, in a due course of administration, have come to the hands of the executor or administrator. 11 Vin. Abr. 312, pi. 7. If the devastavit could be enquired of, then a personal judgment would be the consequence, whilst it might happen, that although the executor had committed a devastavit by paying debts of an inferior dignity, or by releasing a debt improperly, or by converting the goods to his own use; yet, there might be assets sufficient remaining to satisfy the creditor, upon execution ; in which case, none of those things would bean injury or devastavit, as to that creditor. It only becomes an \u25a0 injury to him, when, by a return of nulla bona, it appears that such acts had prevented the *recovery of his debt. It would, therefore, be premature to enquire into a devastavit, before it appeared that such devastavit had injured the creditor. But, after the death of the executor or administrator, none of the assets of the testator or intestate, can remain in the hands of his representative, answerable to the claim - of the creditor; and in a suit against such representative, an enquiry into the devastavit becomes pertinent and proper; for that is the only foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The gist of the action by a creditor of the testator, against the executor for a devastavit, is not the debt of the testator, but the tort of the executor in wasting the assets, which ought to have been applied to the payment of the debt. The action is therefore against the executor in the debet and detinet, for the recovery of compensation against him individually, for his tort; and the debt of the testator, ascertained by the judgment against the executor, is introduced collaterally, as an inducement to the action, and as furnishing the measure of compensation. Wheatley v. Bane, 1 Saund. 216. So the gist of an action against the administrator of an executor, for the devasta-vit of the executor, would be the personal wrong of the executor, which, by the common law, died with the person, but for which the administrator of the executor is responsible, in his character of administrator, by the statute.' The action is not for the recovery of the debt eo nomine, as the debt of the testator, but for compensation for the injury done by the executor; and the debt is matter of inducement, and the measure of the recovery. It is not at all uncommon, that the question whether a debt, and to what amount, is due to the plaintiff by a stranger to the defendant, is necessarily put in issue; as in the case of an escape, the creditor, in a suit against the sheriff, may recover the amount of the debt which he can prove to be due to him from the prisoner who escaped; and if he cannot prove that any debt was due, he can recover nothing. Alexander v. M\u2019Cauley, 4 Term Rep. 611; Ravenscroft v. Eyles, 2 Wils. 294; 4 Vin. Sup. 96, pi. 2. And if an *attorney or agent were sued for failing to collect a aebt, he would not be liable to any recovery, unless it were proved that the debt was due. It is a maxim of law, that there is no right without-a remedy; and especially, when a statute gives a jight and does not prescribe the remedy, the Courts are bound to devise the proper remedy, which, in general, is an action on the case founded on the statute. To give effect to this maxim, general rules of law, introduced for the sake of convenience, yield to cases of necessity, in which injustice would be done by adhering to the general rule. Thus, in an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, as a general rule the plaintiff can only recover damages for the first entry and eviction, and not for the detention of the possession, unless he has regained the possession by entry or action. But, if the estate of the plaintiff is expired, so that he cannot regain the possession, he may recover the profits accrued from the time of eviction till his title expired, without regaining the possession, notwithstanding the general rule. The rule that an executor could not be sued for a devastavit, until there was a judgment for the debt against him as executor, was a rule of convenience, and to avoid mischiefs which would arise, when the suit for a devastavit was against him, and which do not exist in the case of a suit against his executor or administrator. If, however, there was any inconvenience in allowing a suit for the devastavit of the executor against his representative, without a previous judgment for the debt against the executor, that must be submitted to, rather than that the right given by the statute should be unavailing. But, lean see no inconvenience in this remedy, although the fact that no debt was due, or that the executor had not wasted, or that the administrator of the executor has no assets of his testator, would each have been a complete defence for the representative of the executor, and before the statutes allowing double pleading, - he could only put his defence on one of those points. This was an inconvenience common to all cases, in which a party might *have several good pleas, but was confined to'one; as, an executor, although a plea that no debt was due, or that he had no assets, would have been a bar to the action, could plead but one of those pleas. The statute allowing double pleading has remedied this inconvenience; and the representative of an administrator, sued for his intestate\u2019s devastavit, may plead that no debt was due, and that his intestate did not waste or convert the assets, and that he has no assets of his intestate. Although I have found no case of an action against the administrator of an executor for the devastavit of the executor, without a previous judgment against the executor, yet such suits have been common against executors of executors. The opinion which I have suggested on this point, is supported by that of Sergeant Williams, 1 Saurjd. 219, e; and by the doctrine of the Court in 4 Vin. Supp. 196, pi. 2, Rivett v. Jeffries, &c.\nIf I am wrong in this opinion, then the creditor, who would have no reme ly at law under the statute, would be remitted lo his remedy in equity, as before the statute, against the executor or administrator of the executor or administrator ; and it would not follow, that the administrator de bonic non was entitled to any remedy.\nIt is, however, argued, that a creditor who has not obtained a -judgment against the executor or administrator, establishing his demand, cannot, on general principles of law, maintain an action for that purpose, against any but the proper representative of the testator or intestate, because no other can have the means of ascertaining waether the demand be proper or not. But the cases are quite common, in which such suits may be maintained against one not representing the testator or intestate, as against an executor de son tort; and when a wrongful administration has been revoked, a creditor may sue the displaced administrator, and he can only defend himself by shewing that he has legally administered all the assets, except those delivered over to the succeeding administrator or executor; and if'any remain in his hands, not so delivered over, or, *if he has committed a devastavit, by paying debts of inferior, before those of superior dignity, the creditor will recover. 6 Rep. 18, b, Packman\u2019s Case; 11 Vin. Abr. 119, pi. 5.\nThe cases of temporary administrators, who are responsible to the executor or administrator who succeeds them, have been relied upon; and it is said, that for the same reason that they are responsible to their successors, the representative of a deceased executor or administrator should toe responsible to the administrator de bonis non. But the cases are wholly different. The commission of the latter gives him only the goods not adminisiered; whilst in cases of an infant executor or administrator, or where one entitled to administration, or as executor, is absent, or is obstructed by a pending suit; whenever the impediment is removed, a general probate or administration is granted to him for the whole estate, and the administration is grunted in the mean time to the administrator durante minoritate, or durante ab-sentia, or pendente lite, for the use of the executor or administrator, to whom a gen-real probate or administration may be after-wards committed. They are only the bailiff's of such general executor or administrator, and therefore responsible to them. So, if administration is granted to an improper person, or by an improper Court, and afterwards revoked, the administrator to whom administration is after-wards properly granted, has, in such cases, a general commission of administration, and is thereby entitled to call the displaced administrator to accouni. 11 Vin. Abr. 117, pi. 4. The latter is, indeed, as to the former, an executor de son tort.\nI am satisfied upon the whole, that in England an administrator de bonis non never had any such right as is claimed for him in this suit; and our law is to the same effect unless changed by statute.\nThe Act of 1661-2, chap. 45, provides that if an administra cor die before he hath given an account of the estate and obtained his quietus, the Court should have power lo *grant the administration of the estate not so accounted for, to some other person, who may, by virtue thereof, call the heirs, executors or administrators of the former administrator to an account, who shall pay out of the deceased administrator\u2019s estate all such debts as shall be found due to the estate he administered upon, in the first place. This statute also directed distribution to the wife and children, and only applied to the case of a deceased administrator not having accounted ; and in that single case, authorised a commission to the succeeding administrator, for the estate not accounted for, and to call for an account; instead of an administration de bonis non, which gave no right to an account of the goods wasted, and converted; and the only object of that provision in the law, was, to enlarge the rights of the succeeding administrator, in that single case only, beyond the rule of the common law, and to make the debt due from the administrator in that case only, of the first digni*y. The reason why the same rights were not given to an administrator succeeding an executor, was, that it would have defeated the executor\u2019s right to the surplus of the assets administered by him. The effect of this statute was, to enable creditors to recover their debts, after the estate not accounted for came to the hands of the succeeding administrator, out of that fund which they could not reach before; but this only in the case of an administration after an administration, and not in the case of an administrator de bonis non, after an executor; and in effect, placed the rights of the distributees against the estate of ihe first administrator, in that single case, upon ihe fooling of a debt of the highest dignity.\nThe Act of 1705, chap. 33, sec. 13, provided, that when any person shall be chargeable as executor or administrator, or otherwise, with the estate of any person deceased, or with any orphan\u2019s estate, and shall die so chargeable, the estate of such person so dying, shall be liable to pay and satisfy such other deceased person\u2019s or orphan\u2019s estate., before any other debt whatever. This Act, in connection *wlth that of 1661-2, made, in effect, a legacy due from an executor, and the claim of the second administrator after another administrator, claims of the first dignity; but made no provision for creditors, in the case of an executor dying testate or intestate, nor in the case of an administrator, except incidentally as aforesaid.\nThe Act of 1711, chap. 2, sec. 3, provided that, \u201cif it should so happen, that any executor shall die intestate, not having fully performed his executorship, or any administrator shall depart this life, not having fully administered the goods of the intestate, it shall and may be lawful for the Court that granted the certificate for obtaining such probate, or commission of administration, to hear and determine the right of administration, and to grant certificate for obtaining letters of administration of the goods not administered, to such person as by this Act shall have a right thereto.\u201d This was the precise form of the administration de bonis non at the common law; and this Act, which repeals all Acts concerning any matter or thing coming within the purview of that Act, repeals the Act o\u00ed 1661-2, which directed an administration of the goods not accounted for by the first administrator.\nIn 1730, an Act passed, which has been re-enacted into our last Code, subjecting executors and administrators of executors and administrators, who had wasted or converted the assets, to the same liability, as the executor or administrator was subjected to. I have already observed how this liability directly to the creditors, conflicted what a supposed liability to the administrator de bonis non. Creditors, to whom a remedy was given by this Act, were entitled to claim against the assets of the executor or administrator, as for debts of the highest dignity, by virtue of the Act of 1705. But, the dignity of all the debts was equal in that respect, and a simple contract creditor, recovering first, would have the preference over a specialty creditor; whereas, if the fund went into the hands of an administrator de bonis non, and was not sufficient to pay all the debts, \"it would be paid to the creditors, according to the original dignity of their debts. This would be a palpable inconsistency. The Act of 1785, which was re-enacted at the last revisal, modified that of 1705, so far as to make the estate of the deceased executor or administrator liable, as for a debt of the first dignity, to legatees and distributees only. But, it is, in effect, the same; since the legatees would be responsible to creditors, to the amount recovered by them. The Act of 1661-2, if not repealed by that of 1711, is clearly repealed by the Act of 1S19, repealing all Acts not re-published in the Revised Code.\nThe only other statutes, which can be supposed to affect this question, are those which provide for the indemnity of the sureties of an executor or administrator, and the safety of creditors, legatees and distributees. The Act of 1785, (now repealed,) only extended to the indemnity of the sureties, and was, I think, only intended to enable the Court, if the executor or administrator failed to give counter security, if required, to give the same relief to sureties, which creditors, legatees and distributees already had in equity, to compel the executor or administrator to pay the money in his hands into Court, or to a receiver, and to deliver the assets remaining unconverted, to a receiver. 12 Ves. 4. And this, under the statute, might be done in a summary way, by compelling the executor or administrator to settle, pay and deliver, by attachment.\nThe only remaining Act is .that of 1814, re-enacted at the revisal. If this Act really introduced a new description of administrators, (an administrator of the goods not administered, who was entitled to claim those which were converted,) it would only apply to the particular cases provided for by the Act; but I do not think that the statute has this effect. Taken altogether, I think the fair construction of it is, that the administrator de bonis non was intended by the Act, to have only the goods not converted, and not the proceeds of those converted. It provides, that at the instance of the sureties, the Court may revoke \"the authority of the executor or administrator, in whole or in part, and appoint an administrator de bonis non, as if the executor or administrator were dead; or to put the unadminis-tered estate into the hands of the surety or other curator; or make any other order essential to the protection of the surety, having due regard to the interests of creditors, legatees or distributees. If, under this Act, an administrator de bonis non were appointed, he would have the same rights as, and no more than, an administrator de bonis non had at common law for, he is described to be appointed as if the executor or administrator were dead ; and the statute defines,, in effect, the unad-ministered estate as something which might be taken from one, and put into the hands of another; a definition perfectly appropriate to assets remaining in kind, but not to an unliquidated debt due from the executor or administrator. If the administrator de bonis non, or surety, or curator, appointed under this Act, had a right to claim of the executor or administrator, an account of the converted assets, and to have them put into their hands by a summary proceeding of the court, then there would have been little or no use for the additional authority given to the Court, to make any other order upon the subject. That provision I consider as having the same effect, as the Act of 1785 upon the same subject; to enable the Court to secure the fund, by compelling the payment of it into Court, or into the hands of a receiver, by summary process. Upon this construction of the Act, a due regard would be had to the interests of creditors, legatees and distributees. They might still proceed against the executor or administrator, and reach the fund so secured, as if his authority had not been revoked; for, the provision that the suits depending might be continued against the executor, or the name of thg administrator de bonis non, or curator, substituted for him, at the election of the creditor, was intended to enable the creditor, if he pleased, to pursue the administrator de bonis non or curator, without losing the benefit of his suit; and \"does not preclude the other creditors who had not sued, froan proceeding against the displaced executor or administrator for the goods wasted or converted; as a creditor had a right at common law, to proceed against an administrator whose authority was revoked, and who could only defend himself effectually by pleading and proving that he had duly administered all the assets which came to his hands, except what he had delivered over to the succeeding administrator; whilst the construction that such adminis- \u00edrator de bonis non, surety or curator, bad a right to claim the assets converted, would impair the rights of creditors, legatees and distributees in various ways; some of which only will be alluded to. A double commission would be chargeable upon so much of the estate as was converted. The creditors, legatees and dis-tributees, at least the two latter, would be delayed, until after a frequently tedious litigation, the administrator de bonis non, or surety, or curator, had recovered the fund, and until they could, by another tedious suit, recover it from him, and the surety, who was liable to account for the waste of the executor or administrator, would frequently be the person charged with the duty of calling his principal to account. He would be called upon to assert the interests of persons, whose interests were the very reverse of his. The manner in which this duty would frequently be performed, is easily conjectured; and if the executor or administrator died, the remedy given by statute to creditors against his representative, would either be frustrated, or materially varied, as to their effect, as has been before observed. I do not think that this statute has any influence upon the question under consideration.\nIt was said in the argument, that the proceeds of the testator\u2019s or intestate\u2019s perishable goods, directed by statute to be sold, ought not to be considered as assets converted; since the executor or administrator, in this respect, acts by direction of the law, and cannot be supposed to have intended by such sale, to convert the goods to his own use. *If that be so, it would not affect the question under consideration; for, if the administrator de bonis non were entitled to claim the proceeds, it would be upon the ground that the sale was not in such case a conversion, not being the merely voluntary act of the executor or administrator, and not intended by him as a \u25a0conversion. I am inclined to think that such a sale, although a conversion at law, would not be considered as a conversion in equity, so long as the debts remained uncollected; so that if the executor or administrator died before the debts were collected, the bonds uncollected at the time of his death, and which, by the statute, might be assigned to the legatees or distributees, or the money recovered upon them by the administrator of the executor or administrator, might be claimed in equity by the administrator de bonis non; upon the gronnd above stated, on which the cases of a judgment by the executor for the testator\u2019s goods, not enforced by the executor In his life-time, and the stocks changed by the executor for the benefit of the estate, were held to be unadmsnistered assets in equity. If, however, the executor had collected such debts in his life-time, and failed to keep the money separate as the money of the testator, so that it might be identified, and had applied it to his own use, this would, both at law and in equity, amount to a complete conversion.\nIt was also said in the argument, that the general impression in the Commonwealth had long been, that an administrator de bonis non was entitled to call the representative of a deceased executor or administrator to account; and that it was common, if not a matter of course, for such representatives to account for, and pay over, to the administrator de bonis non, all the assets converted by the executor or administrator; and that the Acts of the legislature already referred to, shew that such has been the impression of the Legislature.\nThe review already taken of the statutes, shews, I think, that nothing is to be found in any Act since that of 1711, '^indicating any thing as to the Legislative understanding on this subject, and that Act, compared with the Act of 1661-2, shews that the Legislature then had distinctly in view, toe difference between a commission of administration of the estate not accounted for, and one of the estate not administered ; and that clause of the Act of 1711 was unnecessary for any purpose whatever, but to repeal the Act of 1661-2, and put all administrations de bonis non upon the same footing, as well those granted after the death of an executor, as after the death of an administrator. A general power to grant administrations would have embraced administrations de bonis non, to be granted in all cases, as at the common law; but, such a general grant would have left the Act of 1661-2, in force, and applicable to the case of an administration after an administration. The clause was therefore necessary in that Act, to repeal the Act of 1661-2, and for no other purpose; and accordingly, it has never been thought necessary, in the various revis\u00e1is of the law, to re-enact that clause.\nThat the general impression of the country has been such as is stated, is, I think, very probable; and the origin of that impression is easily traced. Commissions of administration were originally granted by the Governor and Council forming the General Court, and signed by the Governor, upon the certificate of the County Courts, that the party was entitled, and had given proper security; and finally, they were made out by the Clerk of the County Court, and signed by a justice of the peace, upon a similar certificate of the County Court. The practice of actually making out the commission in form, has been, lor a great length of time, discontinued; the certificate of the Court, upon which the commission might issue, being sufficient for all practical purposes. No defendant can claim the production of the commission, at law or in equity. Indeed, I have never seen a commission of administration given in Virginia. The form cf a commission of administration de bonis non is almost forgotten ; and added to this, all attention to pleading *having for a long time been discontinued in practice, except in the use of short sentences, as \u201cnil debet,\u201d \u201cnon assumpsit,\u201d \u201cfully administered,\u201d &c. the idea was naturally adopted, that since upon the plea of \u201cfully administered,\u201d an executor or administrator could not defend himself against the claim of a creditor, by shewing that he had converted the assets to his own use; therefore, such a conversion was not an administration; and consequently, the as sets so converted, must go to the administrator de bonis non administratis. The reason why evidence of a conversion does not support the plea of fully administered, is not because such conversion is not an administration, but because it is, as to the creditor, not a legal administration. As to him, it is a wrong, but not as to any ocher. The question of devastavit is not put in issue upon that plea; but the replication puts in> issue the amount of assets which came to the hands of the executor or administrator, and their application to the payment of debts of equal or superior dignity, in a legal course of administration, and nothing more. The jury can only find against the defendant the amount of assets in his hands, liable to the creditor\u2019s demand. 11 Vin. Abr. 312, pi. 7. They do not find that he has not fully administered, but that-he has not legally administered, so as to bar the creditor.\nIt was said in the argument of the cause, that if the administrator de bonis non cannot claim an account of the assets converted by an executor or administrator, against his representatives, then in all cases where the representatives of deceased executors and administrators have accounted with administrators de bonis non for, and paid over to them, such assets, the estates of such executors or administrators will be still liable to creditors, legatees or distributees, as if no such payment had been made. It is not proper to decide this question, before it shall be presented in a shape to enable the Court, upon full consideration, to decide it conclusively. If such would be the consequence, it would afford no reason for deciding otherwise *than according to our convictions of what the law is. If any loss should fall upon a party, by acting under a mistake of the law, this Court has not the power of relieving him. I think it however, not amiss, to state now, that I am strongly under the impression, that the estate of an executor or administrator would not be liable to creditors, legatees or distributees, for the assets so pajd over, unless they had, before payment, asserted their claim against his estate, by suit; upon the ground, that such payment was an admission by the executor or administrator of the executor or administrator, that the assets had not been converted ; as in the case of the money kept separate by the executor or administrator, as the property of his testator or intestate, and the other cases in equity before referred to. But, if the executor or administrator had been guilty of a devastavit by paying debts of inferior, before those of superior dignity, or had otherwise committed waste, for which his representative had not so accounted; in the first case, the estate of the executor or administrator would still be liable, to the extent of such devastavit, to creditors, and for the other waste, to creditors, legatees and distribu-tees. Packman\u2019s Case, 6 Rep. 18, b; 11 Vin. Abr. 119, pi. S.\nIf the practice of the country has been contrary to these views, I do not find that it has ever been deliberately sanctioned by this Court; nor do I consider it as a question of practice liable to be varied I and moulded, according to the discretion of the Court; but, as a question of legal right, depending upon the commission of administration, which alone gives any right to the administrator de bonis non, and which gives him a right only to \u201cthe goods,.chattels, rights and credits, which, were of the testator or intestate, at the time of his death not administered by the former executor or administrator;\u201d which, in terms, does not embrace the value or proceeds of goods converted by the executor or administrator; such proceeds not being any part of the goods and chattels, rights, and credits, which were of the testator or intestate at the time of his death. This ^construction and effect of the terms of the commission, is perfectly settled by the common law', and by all the legislation which has any' bearing upon, the question, here or in England, and which is in conflict with any other construction. The statute giving a remedy to creditors against the executor or administrator of an executor or administrator, for assets of the first testator or intestate, wasted or converted to his own use, by the first executor or administrator, gives to all creditors an equal right to claim under the statute, whether that be in respect to the assets of the executor or administrator, as. for a simple contract debt only, or as for a claim of the first dignity; so that the creditor getting the first judgment, would have the prior right to satisfaction, without regard to the original dignity of the debt, and that, whether his claim was asserted in a Court of Law or Equity ; which equality of right amongst the creditors, given by the statute, would be utterly frustrated, by allowing the administrator de bonis non to recover the funds; since the debts would, in that case, be payable by him, out of the funds, according to their original legal priorities.\nIf the administrator de bonis non has not this right, the creditors have an immediate remedy against the executor or administrator of the first executor or administrator; in which it is only necessary to prove a waste or conversion to an amount sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s demand, and not to settle accurately the accounts of the administration of the executor or administrator; and without the intervention of the administrator de bonis non, all creditors, to the extent of the fund in question, would be secured by bonds given by the legatees to the executor or administrator of the executor or administrator, to indemnify him against debts of the first testator, which may appear and be recovered against him. He alone being responsible to the creditors for the fund for which his testator or intestate was responsible, he is the proper, and only proper person, to whom those bonds should be given; whereas, if the administrator de bonis non has a right to recover this fund, *it will be burthened with two commissions instead of one; which would be paid in the other case, or even more than two, if there were several successive administrators de bonis non. The creditors would be delayed, until after a tedious litigation, the accounts of the first executor or administrator were finally settled in the suit of the administrator de bonis non, and he had been enabled to coerce the payment of the money, and their rights would be varied as aforesaid. They might further be delayed by the necessity of a suit against the administrator de bonis non; and so the legatees and distrib-utees would also be delayed, not only by the first suit by the administrator de bonis non, but by their suit against him for a settlement of his accounts; and the hazard of loss to creditors, legatees and distribu-tees, would be doubled, trebled or quadrupled, according as there were one or more successive administrators de bonis non, from the possible, and indeed common, insolvency of executors and administrators and their sureties. The hazard of the insolvency of the first administrator is unavoidable; but the funds would be lost by the insolvency of any of the administrators de bonis non, if they received them, even although the estate of the first executor or administrator were good. Many mischiefs, in respect to delay, expense and hazard, would arise from giving to the administrator de bonis non, the right to. call the representative of the deceased executor or administrator to account, without one solitary advantage to any party concerned, which they would not have upon the contrary doctrine; and if this was a question, not of legal right, (as to which we are bound to administer the law,) as it is, but a mere question of practice, and we had authority to control it at pleasure, I should not hesitate to say7, that every consideration of convenience and justice should induce us to adopt the principles, which I have supposed to be the settled principles of law on this subject.\nThis case is a good commentary upon the question, whether an administrator de bonis non has a right to call *the representative of a deceased administrator to account. Wernick died intestate, and Marks administered on his estate in 1782, and gave an administration bond, with Coleman as his surety. The latter being anxious to get an indemnity, Marks deposited in the hands of Douglas S1S00, (which was not equal to the amount of the assets,) to be held by him for the indemnity of Coleman. Marks dying, Coleman took administration de bonis non on Wernick\u2019s estate, and sued the representative of Marks, and the executor of Douglas, in order to recover the $1500, in his character of administrator de bonis non. Douglas\u2019s executor answers, that the advances made by his testator to Marks, after the deposit of the $1500, exceeded that sum. There is no intimation in the proceedings, that there is any creditor or distributee of Wernick, who claims any thing against Wernick\u2019s representative; and if the administrator de bonis non has the right contended for, such an allegation is not necessary to entitle him to recover. Coleman died pending this suit; and the plaintiff took administration de bonis non of'Wernick\u2019s estate. Upwards of forty years having elapsed since the death of Wernick, and no creditor or dis-tributee now claiming, there is the strongest reason to believe that none will ever claim. This at least is possible; and if so, and the present plaintiff could recover the $1500; then, after his death, the next administrator de bonis non could claim it with interest, from his representative; and so it would devolve from administrator de bonis non, to administrator de bonis non, forever, to the exclusion of all other creditors of the deceased administrators de bonis non; the claim of each administrator de bonis non, upon the estate of the preceding administrator de bonis non, being preferred in dignity to any other debt; a more perfect perpetuity than was ever before devised.\nThe scire facias to revive the appeal should be quashed, as improvidently awarded.\n\u25a0\"'JUDGE COALTER.\nThis case brings, for the first time, before this Court, the propriety of a practice, which, it seems to be admitted, has heretofore prevailed without objection, of an administrator de bonis non calling to account the executor or administrator of the first administrator, in relation to the goods wasted or converted by that administrator. The practice, which also seems to have existed, of the administrator d\u00e9 bonis non with the will annexed, calling the administrator or executor of the executor to account for such goods, has also been incidentally debated, as one standing on the same grounds.\nThe British doctrines and authorities have been brought fully to the view of the Court, and will be first examined, in regard to the practice there; and if such a course would not be permitted there, I will then enquire whether there is anything in our laws, which would make it inexpedient, if not unlawful, to change the practice here.\nIt is said, that in that country executors were entitled to the surplus, where there was no residuary clause in favor of some one else, or something else in the will, shewing that the executor was not entitled to it; and that, except as to creditors, every thing which had been converted by the first executor, belonged to his estate when he was entitled to the surplus; and though he would stand as trustee for creditors, and his estate be responsible to them, they only had a right to charge the fund in the hands of his representatives ;\"for, if the administrator de bonis non got it, whether necessary for creditors or not, that which might belong to the estate of the executor would thus be taken from it; and that therefore, the commission of the administrator de bonis non with the will annexed, only authorised him to take possession of the goods of the testator remaining in kind,-or unconverted : that as to the administrator, inasmuch as before the Statute of Distributions, he was entitled always to the surplus, the like injustice *would follow, if his executor or administrator should be liable to account, except as to creditors, for the assets converted, and that consequently, the commission to the administrator de bonis non only gave him a right to the assets remaining in kind, or unconverted.\nWhether the Statute of Distributions it self ought to make any change in relation to the powers of the administrator de bonis non, under his commission, and especially in the case of intestacy, may be worthy of enquiry. One thing, however, I suppose must be admitted: that if any positive statute, or one or more, which could not be fully carried into effect, without enlarging his rights under his commission, so as to extend them to such a subject, had been enacted, either directly extending the power thereto, or, by necessary implication, doing so, the commission, though issued in the usual form, would extend to, and enable them to claim, the fund, as fully as if, from the beginning, such fund had been considered unadministered assets. If it is declared by statute, to be unadministered assets, the administrator\u2019s right to it, under the commission, would necessarily be extended to it.\nBefore the Statute of Distributions, I believe it was admitted, that where there was no residuary clause in favor of some one else, the executor of course took the surplus ; but, after that statute, as the law provided a successor to an undisposed of surplus, if it appeared not to be the intention of the testator to give it to the executor, but to leave it undisposed of, the executor was held a trustee of that surplus, for the next of kin, according to the statute; and so, in like manner, was the administrator, in all cases. Whenever the executor or administrator then converted the goods or any part of them, and died leaving a surplus in their hands, not administered, in payment of debts, and the executor was not entitled to the surplus, they were considered as trustees of that fund, as well for creditors as next of kin, and their estates answerable therefor. This fund, before the statutes which gave a suit to creditors ^against the representatives of executors or administrators, was a mere trust to be enforced in equity in favor of creditors and next of kin, etc.; and it would seem to me, ought regularly to pass .into the hands of the administrator de bonis non, for their benefit; and that his commission ought to be held to extend to it, as it sometimes does to subjects, which are not considered in equity as having been converted. It seems, however, to have been the practice in England, either for the creditor or next of kin to go into equity, and there reach the fund, and have it applied as by layv it ought. Whether this can be done in all cases, without calling into Court the administrator de bonis non, I am not well advised. I incline to think it has been done in many cases without doing so. As to creditor suing, without making him a party, it may be that they could do so, in cases where they had established the debt against his predecessor; but where that was not the case; and unless it appeared that there was no dispute or difficulty as to that matter, I presume he must make the administrator de bonis non a parly; for neither he, nor the dis-tributees, would be bound by a decree charging the estate with a debt, in a suit to which they were no parties. There may be some peculiar cases, such as actions for escapes, on mesne process, before a debt has been established, in which the debt must be proved, in order to shew the injury that has been done; but if there are such, it proceeds from the necessity of the case, and because the party who has done the .wrong, is not, in this way, to shield himself from the consequences of his own acts; but it will be, to me at least, a new doctrine, if a decree or judgment can be recovered, so as to charge an estate with a debt, without a representative of the estate being before the Court. If such decree would not charge the estate, so as to end the matter, it would be for want of the necessary parties; and if it did not end the matter, such decree would be wrong.\nWhen the next of kin come, I presume they must all come, and they of course being entitled to the administration, *would be entitled to the fund, subordinate always to creditors, who can pursue the fund in their hands, and to secure whom a Court of Equity in England will require bond to refund, whenever it is deemed necessary. But, if some of them only have been appointed administrators de bonis non, or it has been granted to a stranger, then if the suit is by the next of kin, the administrators themselves would be parties plaintiff, with others. But whether, in the case of the stranger, they can proceed without making the administrator de bonis non a party, may be a question; for he represents creditors, may have paid debts himself, and this fund may be necessary to reimburse him, &'c. ; and there being such a representation of the estate, of which this fund is a part, it may be and probably is necessary, that he shoud be a party.\nBe this as it may, there are certainly many cases in England, in which the next of kin have recovered against the executor himself such fund, when he was not entitled to the surplus, but claimed to hold it.\nIn the case of Corden v. Noden, Prec. in Ch. 12; Ibid. 92, the testator gave legacies to his relations, amounting to nearly the whole of his estate, and also gave legacies to his executors, and lived several years, during which he increased his estate considerably. In a suit by the next of kin against them, they were decreed to distribute it.\nSo in Farrington v. Knightly, Ibid. 566, there was \u00e1 similar decree, and it was there said, that since the Statute of Distributions, the succession to a personal estate is as much established, as to real before the statute;, and that the executors should claim to have the surplus to their own use, because they are made executors, would be to construe the will by a rule which probably the testator did not understand ; for, he might be ignorant of the import of the word executors, or never intended, by making them such, to give them his personal estate; and that here it would be more unreasonable, because they had legacies given .them. So that executors, says the Judge, are but trustees, and *are to have nothing more to their own use, than what the testator plainly intended them as legatees or devisees, and not the .whole residuum by virtue of the executor-ship. The Eord Chancellor then puts this \u25a0case: If A. and B. severally make their \u25a0wills, and make C. executor; and A. gives him the surplus, but B. does not, and then C. dies intestate; in this case, the personal estate of A. and B. shall go several ways. For, the administrator of C. is admitted to the administration of the personal estate of A. but the next of kin are to have administration to him; which proves that <G. as to that, was but a trustee. Now, although the next of kin of B. might come into equity, according to the British practice, without taking out administration de bonis non to B. and get this surplus, or the administrator of C. might retain the surplus of A\u2019s estate, without taking administration de bonis non to A. (that being considered there the shortest way, as creditors could still pursue the fund,) j'ei they might take the administration de bonis non, and it is their right to do so; which gives them the right to claim immediately, and without this form.\nThis doctrine is exemplified also by the case of Rachfieid v. Careless, 2 P. Wms. 1S8, where a legacy of SI. was given to the executor for his care in fulfilling the will. He notwithstanding claimed to hold the surplus, and the next of kin sue for it. It was there declared, that the bequest of SI. amounted to a declaration of the trust, especially considering that it is a fundamental rule in a Court of Equity, that an executor is but a trustee; and, on his dying intestate, so much of the testator\u2019s personal estate as remains unadministered, must go to the testator\u2019s next of kin, to wit, to the administrator de bonis non, and not to the administrator of the executor. I will here remark, that in both these cases, the Judges, when speaking of the right to the thing, speak of it as belonging to the administrator de bonis non, as distinguished from the administrator of the executor. As to the jurisdiction of *equity to give it immediately to one who may ultimately be entitled to receive it from the one having the right to receive it in the first instance, it is another question.\nI take it that the Judge in this last case, could not have intended to say, that the unconverted assets went to the administrator de bonis non. No one could doubt that; for, no one else could get them. The next of kin, unless they administered, could not. They remained without an owner, until administration ; when the legal, not the equitable right to them, would vest in the administrator de bonis non. This was not a suit to recover such unadministered assets, or no such decree could have been given ; and it cannot be supposed, I presume, that if the next of kin had taken administration, they could not have recovered this subject, not administered in payment of debts, in that character; but must sue merely as next of kin. It is because they would be entitled to it in that character, and because it is an equitable subject in the hands of a trustee, that they may come at once into equity, where substance alone is regarded, and call the trustee to account, without the form of taking administration.\nSo, too, before the statute of Charles, creditors where also relieved in equity, and indeed in one case in the Exchequer, they were sustained at law before that statute, on the principles of the civil law. 3 Keb. 517. But that case seems not to have been approved of, or followed up.\nThus, in Chatnberlayne v. Chamber-layne, 1 Ch. Cas. 257, a few years before the statute of Charles, it was ruled, that if an executor make devastavit and die, his executor is liable to make it good to the creditors, if he has assets from the executor.\nSo, in Vanacre\u2019s Case, lb. 303, the same was ruled, and the creditors directed to come to account, and have satisfaction pro-portionably; and it is there said, that an executor, in case of devastavit, is to be considered in the nature cf a trustee of an estate.\n*So, in Price v. Herbert, 2 Ch. Cas. 217, the Lord Chancellor said, \u201cAlthough, by the common law, when the executor wastes, his executor shall not be Bable, because it is a personal wrong, it is otherwise hero; and the common law will come to it at last;\u201d and it was decreed that the executor should answer for the waste, as far as he has assets.\nThese cases would seem to be founded on the waste by the executor, which happens when judgment has been recovered against him, and nulla bona returned. I have seen no case, nor have I searched sufficiently to say that there are none, where a debt has, in the first instance, been set up in a suit charging such waste in a bill in equity; but, I am content for the present to say, that it may, if proper parties are before the Court.\nBut, as was predicted by the Judge, the common law did, in a short time thereafter, come to it to a certain extent, by the statute of 30th Char. 2, explained and extended by that of William & Mary. Those statutes in substance provided, as ours has since done, that all and every the executors and administrators of any person or persons, who, as executor in his own wrong, and the executor or administrator of an executor or administrator of right, who shall waste or convert to his own use, goods, chattels or estate, of his testator or intestate, shall be liable and chargeable in the same mariner, as his testator or intestate might have been.\nIt is contended, that this statute gives a right to the creditor to sue the executor or administrator of an executor, or the executor or administrator of an administrator, when the executor or administrator has wasted, riot only in the case where the creditor has recovered a judgment against the executor or administrator, and had a return of nulla bona, so as to fix the dev-astavit on him ; but to sue on a bond or other chose in action ; and not only to set up that debt at law against the estate, but to suggest and prove a devastavit in the executor or administrator. I doubt this; *and if this is not the case, but if he can only sue under this statute for a devastavit, when he could bring such suit against the executor, then a large class of creditors could not sue under this statute.\nIt becomes necessary, therefore, in the first place, to enquire, under what circumstances the executor himself was liable to an action for-a devastavit, and see the reason why he was so liable; and then see how far those reasons and others will bear me out in supposing, that his executor or administrator ought not to be liable in any other manner, or in any other case.\nThe case of Wheatley v. Bane, 1 Saund. 216, is, perhaps, the first case but one, which clearly decided ,this question. There the creditor had obtained a judgment against the executor, who, he alleges, had wasted the assets, &c. ; and the action is in the debet, suggesting this waste, &c. It was triecj on a demurrer to the declaration, and many objections were made; amongst others, that it was an action of debt for a tort, which dies with the person; and if debt will lie, it may be brought against his executor; and that for the same reason that this action is brought on a judgment against him, it might be brought on a judgment against the testator, or on a bond entered into by him, &c. ; that in case the action would survive, jt would be doubtful whether it would be debt on a judgment or simple contract, &c. But, the action was sustained.\nIt will be found, however, that though attempts were made to carry it further, this action of debt for a devastavit against the executor himself, has never been sustained, except where a judgment has been first obtained against him, in which assets have been admitted, or found to be in his hands, and where, on a. return of nulla bona, it appeared that he had wasted them. It was held, too, that it did not survive against his executor or administrator; and therefore, the statutes giving the suit against them, were enacted. It was also held that this action for a waste by the executor, did not lie against him on a judgment against, or *on a bond executed by, his testator, notwithstanding the privity between them, because of the difficulty of pleading and making a proper defence, &c. ; and because it was with difficulty the action was introduced, and the Courts would not carry it further.\nAll the reasons why it should not be sustained, in such case, against the executor himself, apply, if possible, with ten-fold force, to shew that it ought not to lie against his executor or administrator; and hence it no doubt has followed, that we see no case in which this action has been sustained, since the statute, against the executor or' administrator of an executor or administrator, except on a judgment against the executor or administrator, establishing the debt, and fixing a devastavit on him. It is founded on the tort, and though there is also a judgment, it nevertheless ranks only as a simple contract claim; and notwithstanding Sergeant Williams, in his note on the above case in Saunders, seems to intimate that it may be sustained against the executor or administrator of the executor or\u2019 administrator, without a previous judgment establishing a devastavit, yet he cites no case to support his position; and I therefore take it for granted, that none such had then occurred. I feel confident that he had not examined the matter with reference to the pleadings, or he never could have come to that conclusion.\nHow an administrator of an executor can b,e privy to the first testator, so as to defend himself against a suit brought on a bond executed by the testator, I cannot perceive. The only case which looks at all that way, is that of Trivett v. Jeffries, given to us in 4 Vin. Supp.'192, pi. 2; and which was a suit against the executors of an administrator, on the bond of the intestate, and was prosecuted on this ground, as I understand the case. The administrator, at his death, had goods of the intestate, not converte'd or wasted, enough to pay the debt. These came to his executors, and were in their hands at the institution *of the suit. There was no waste by the executor, charged. There was no administrator de bonis non; and the question was, whether these goods could be charged in the hands of the executor of the administrator, as they might have been in his hands. It was held that the action could not be sustained, though there was a verdict finding that there were assets, as alleged; for, there was no privity between the executor and intestate.\nIt was said that it could not be maintained at common law for that reason; that it could not be under the statutes of Ch. 2, and Wm. & Mary, for there was no devastavit in the executor charged; and hence it has been supposed that this was impliedly saying, that such devastavit might have been charged in that case, so as to bring it within the statute. But I do not think so. What was meant was this; that a devastavit must be charged to bring the case within the statute; but here it was not only not charged, but it was not a case in which such charge could be made; for, it is on a bond of the intestate, not on a judgment against the administrator.\nIt surely could not have escaped the Court in that case, that a charge of a 'devastavit would not have created any privity between the executors and the intestate, so as to have enabled them to defend that suit; to plead that it was not the act and deed of the intestate, obtained from him by duresse, or that he had paid it in his life-time, &c. How could such debt, in the first instance, be set up against them, so as to charge the estate of the intestate in their hands? Did the statute mean to alter the common law, which requires that the suit which is to establish the debt, shall be brought against him who is privy to, and represents as well the person, as the estate, of the intestate? It never has been so held, and never can be. It has only been held to continue the action which once accrued against the executor or administrator for a devastavit, and which, if not given against his executor or administrator, would die with him.\n*In addition to the above cases on this subject, I refer to the cases of Berwick v. Andrews, reported in 1 Salk. 314, and 2 Bd. Raym. 971; to an anonymous case in 1 Vent. 292; to Ent v. Withers, Ibid. 321, which will be found also more fully stated in 3 Keb. 797, and 825; to Bathurst\u2019s Case, 2 Vent, 40; and to Brown v. Collins, 3 Keb. 462.\nBut, the administrator of an executor is sued on a bond of the testator, charging a devastavit in the executor, and he pleads that the executor fully administered, and it turns out that he did pay away, in discharge of debts, the whole of the assets \u25a0which he had converted, but they are debts of inferior dignity to the bond. Still, I maintain that this is not necessarily and per se a devastavit; for, he may have left assets enough in kind to pay the debt, and which have gone over to the administrator de bonis non, and which would have been rendered in execution, had judgment been recovered against the executor. Surely this would be a good defence; otherwise, however large the estate, no executor ought to pay debts of inferior dignity, without first converting the whole of the assets; for, if he does, and dies, and the unconverted assets go to the administrator de bonis non, who wastes them, the estate of the executor will be answerable. Any course of decision, leading to such injustice, can never have my support. He has a right to make the defence, or he has not; and if he has, how is it to be tried in this suit at law on the bond? Assets enough, or some assets, may have gone to the administrator de bonis non. He may have wasted or paid debts of inferior dignity; and if he has, who is to sustain the loss? And how is this to be established in a suit to which he is no party?\nAgain. In England, this claim, as before said, is but in nature of a simple contract; and there, if the executor or administrator of the executor or administrator, pays out debts of any dignity, he stands safe; but here, the claim, if sued for by the administrator de bonis non, if he can sue for it, or bj- the legatees or next of kin, is a debt of *the first dignity. But if, in a suit at law by the creditor, it would only rank as in England, there will be difficulties and dangers here on al! sides, which would not beset the road to justice in England. I incline to think that would be its rank at law. It is founded on the tort, according to the very terms of the statute giving the suit; and which leaves it at law, as in England. How a Court of Equity would consider it, on principles of substitution, and permitting the creditor to stand, as it were, in the shoes of the next of kin, &c. is another matter.\nRestrain the cases, then, to those in which a debt has been established in a suit against the executor or administrator, and the devastavit fixed, and all those difficulties vanish. This fixes a debt against the executor, and there is no plea of fully administered, except as to his estate.\nThus far, then, I am willing to admit that in England, the practice has been for the creditor to sue under these statutes, where a devastavit had previously been fixed by judgment as aforesaid; and when that was not done, they went into equity, either against the executor or administrator of the executor or administrator, or the legatees or distributees, &c. as the case might be; inasmuch as the Courts of Equity were open to them, as well before as since the statutes. But, our practice has. been different. Here the administrator has gone for the fund, as has been first stated.\nThis practice will be found to have originated, in the first instance, in positive statute, passed upwards of a century and a half ago; and even if that statute has been repealed, or its policy changed by a subsequent statute, (which I will hereafter deny,) still it will be found that our laws on the subject of executors and administrators, and of the estates of testators and intes-tates, have, from time to time, during that whole period, undergone so many changes and alterations from those of England, all concurring to shew the propriety of out-practice, and enacted under a full knowledge of its existence, and many of which laws, it seems to me, cannot *well stand or be executed under the proposed change of practice; that I think that practice, if not now sanctioned by positive law, has an equally legal and sure foundation. Hence it has followed, that there being no necessity for creditors to resort to their remedy at law under the statute, even where they had judgments, or to equity where they had not, inasmuch has the administrator de bonis non got in the fund, we hear of no suits either of the one kind or the other by creditors.\nAs to legatees or distributees coming into-Court directly, and where there is no administrator de bonis non, or where there is, without bringing him in as a party, in order to reach such fund and distribute it, the principles of our decisions, as J understand them, are opposed to such pretension. Here, it is considered, as I understand, that every fund that is subject to debts, must go into the hands of one who can be sued at law for the debt, who gives bond and security, can be ruled to counter-security or displaced, and the fund taken from him ; and it is not enough that the party may be entitled, after debts are paid. Hays v. Hays, S Munf. 418. We have, it is true, made some exceptions to this; as where a suit has been long pending, no debts appearing, &c. on the party giving bond and security. But, bond from such a party is not like that of an administrator. He can be displaced in a summary way, &c. but the legatee cannot. The structure of our laws, then, arising from the situation of our country, is different in this respect, as in many others, from those in England; and hence the propriety, and indeed the necessity, of a different practice.\nBut, suppose that in England, (as I incline to think it is here, at least since the Act of 1785,) there was no such thing as an executor having the surplus, except by express residuarj' bequest; and let usgo further, and suppose that no such thing had ever existed there, either as to executors or administrators; can it be supposed, that it ever would have been doubted that the administrator de bonis non was entitled to get into his hands every thing to which creditors *and next of kin were entitled? The reason for the contrary opinion and practice never would have existed, and we cannot presume the practice would. But, our early laws expressly gave the right to the administrator de bonis non, to call in this fund.\nThe Act of 1661, 2 Hen. Stat. at Large, 92, provides, that where an administrator dies before he has given an account of the estate and obtained his quietus, the Court may grant the administration of that estate, so not accounted for, to some other person, who may, by virtue thereof, call the heirs, executors or administrators of the former administrator to an account, who shall pay out of the deceased administrator\u2019s estate, all such debts as shall be found due to the estate he administered on, in the first place.\nAgain. By the Act of 1705, 3 Hen. Stat. 371, sec. 13, it is provided, that where any person is chargeable as executor or administrator, or otherwise, with the estate of any person deceased, and shall die so chargeable, the estate of such person shall be liable to pay and satisfy such other deceased person\u2019s or orphan\u2019s estate, before any other debt, &c. Thus, the provisions of the other Act, are extended to executors as well as administrators, not only as to the dignity of such debt, but as to the accountability to the administrator de bonis non; for, in no other way can it come to the estate; and it was not until long after this, (viz. in 1730,) that we had a statute, 4 Hen. Stat. 285, similar to those of Char. 2, and Wm. & Mary, empowering creditors to sue. Mark the phraseology of this law. The estate of the trustee shall be answerable. How? Not by suit against the heir, legatee, &c.; but the representatives of the personal estate most certainlj'. To whom answerable? To the deceased person\u2019s estate; not to the heir, distributee, &c., but to him who has a right to the personal estate, to wit, the administrator de bonis non. Our Courts of Equity, then, as early as 1661, had jurisdiction at the suit of the administrator de bonis non, to call *the representatives of the first administrator to account; and since 1705, to call the executor or administrator of an executor to account; and it has been constantly the practice to do so.\nShall an after statute, then, giving a right to cteditors to sue in a particular case, be considered as operating more than to give a remedy cumulative, as it were, to creditors in such cases; or shall it be considered as abrogating a practice, which that great feature in the law, in relation to the priority of such claims, seems to me to require a continuance of, merely because subsequent Acts may not repeat and continue, in the precise terms of the Act of 1661, the liability to the administrator de bonis non? And this, under the idea of a legal right in the creditor to be protected from the effects of a statute, passed twenty-five years before the Act, under which he claims this right. This statute, then, cannot repeal or alter that of 1705.\nOur Courts are full of cases of suits by the administrator de bonis non claiming such a fund. This is one of them, in which no one thought of the objection until it came here. On the other hand, where are the cases of suits by creditors against the representatives of executors or administrators, either at law or in equity? How have they been prosecuted? Have thej' set up the debt in such suit, or have they first sued the administrator de bonis non for that purpose?\nBut, suppose the administrator de bonis non says to the creditor, \u201cI have no assets ; go against the representative of my predecessor ; he wasted assets enough to nay your debt.\u201d But, the creditor says, \u201cTrue, I have found that out; but your predecessor left no estate beyond enough to pay his own bond debts. My claim is in the nature of a simple contract, and of inferior dignity. Your\u2019s would stand higher; you must go;\u201d or \u201cI cannot go, because I have no judgment establishing a devastavit. \u201d What could the administrator de bonis non say to this? If he failed, would or would it not be a devastavit?\n*A11 these inconveniences may be avoided by adhering to the present practice; for, if the administrator de bonis non has a right to call for all the assets not administered, that is, not paid away, in debts, by the executor or first administrator, and the creditor establishes his debt against him, and he has properly administered all the effects which have come to his hands ; and this creditor cannot be paid, and if the executor or first administrator has paid debts of inferior dignity', not leaving enough to pay this debt; then, the way is open and plain for him to go into equity against the estate of that party who has done him this injury.\nWhether the executor, in this State, has been entitled to the surplus, since the Act of 1785, has never been brought before this Court, and ought not to be decided incidentally : but as some reasons have been given to shew that he may, I will merely observe, that as before shewn. Courts of Equity, ever since the Statute of Distributions, have treated them, whenever they could, as trustees. Our early statutes, before cited, clearly treated them as such, and gave the surplus to the administrator de bonis non. All our laws, in short, requiring them to give bond, holding them to counter security, &c. have placed them more in that character, than they stood in England. It is just too. that in all cases they should be so. And it was on a view of those ancient statutes, that I said in Dykes v. Woodhouse, 3 Rand. 312, that if this question was res nova, I would have serious doubts about it, even before the Act of 1785.\nWhen the Act of 1785 was about to provide for the succession to intestate\u2019s estates, and provides that when any one shall die intestate as to his goods and chattels, or any part thereof, what did the Legislature mean by the words or any part thereof? If they intended a partial intestacy as it regarded an executor, by making an executor only of a part, it was unnecessary to use those words; for, the general law, as it before stood, distributed in such cases. So too, of a total intestacy, as it regarded the appointment *or qualification of an executor, either because no executor is named, or because the executor refuses. In these cases, although there is a will bequeathing the whole or greater part of the estate, there is a technical intestacy; insomuch, that an administration with the will or testament annexed, is to be granted. But, in all these cases, the surplus would be distributed under the law as it before stood. To confine the words, then, to those, or like cases, might seem to impute to the legislature a work o\u00ed supererogation. The matter in hand was to provide how estates shall go by law, if the owner has not declared his wish on the subject. If he has, that wish must stand, although he has not appointed an executor, and in legal phase, is intestate. It did not mean, then, that kind of intestacy; for, it does not dispose of the estate in that case. But at present, it seems to me, that it intended to provide, that when the owner gave no other destination to his property by will, with or without an executor, he was to be considered as intestate in that sense of the word, as to such property, and that it should be distributed. This gives an operation and meaning to the words, and would introduce something new, or settle what might have been before doubtful; and in this way', we can account for their introduction.\nIf my impressions are right as to this matter, it is surely an additional reason why we should adhere to the present practice, as one reason for hot giving the fund to the administrator de bonis non no longer exists\u00bb\nBut it is said, that the Act of 1711, repealing all Acts within its purview, not having re-enacted the provisions above noticed in former laws, as to the right of administrators de bonis non to call for the account as above mentioned, repealed those Acts; at least, that it repealed the Act of 1661. But, there are many other important provisions in former Acts, in relation to estates of testators and intestates, which are not embodied in this Act, such as that declaring the right of the Commonwealth to the surplus, in '\"case there be no next of kin; the exemption of an executor or administrator from a personal judgment, until a devastavit is proved; 1 Hen. Stat. 446; the liability of the justices for failing to take bonds; the priority given to claims against the estates of- executors or administrators above mentioned, and which is in the same clause; provisions for counter security ; the right to demand a refunding bond, &c. Must it, in short, be considered a repeal of every provision thereafter existing on the subject of deceased persons\u2019 estates, not again provided for in that Act? It would seem to me, that this would be giving an unreasonable latitude to this repealing clause.\nThe former laws had confined the probate of wills and granting administrations, &c. to the County? Courts. This Act extends it, in certain cases, to the General Court, and subjects them, in case of neglect in taking bonds. Could it be supposed that they were to be subjected, and the County Courts not? The evident object of this Act was more clearly to define the manner of granting probates, letters of administration, and of administrations de bonis non, and how to be authenticated, &c., prescribing the forms of the bonds to be given, oaths to be taken, &c. ; and as it regards this particular question, it would be strange to suppose that it was intended to take away the right of the administrator de bonis non, to call for the accounts in question, when the same Act, in the 4th and 9th sections, (speaking of the effect of probates and administration prescribed by that Act, and which includes of course those of administrators de bonis non,) declares that it shall empower and enable them to sue for, recover and receive, by all lawful ways and means whatsoever, all and singular the goods and chattels, real and personal, and all and every, the estate or estates, as any executor or administrator might lawfully do, by any ways or means whatsoever. Now, in what way, and how far, could executors and administrators, and administrators de bonis non then recover? They could then recover the very fund now in question.\n*But, it is contended, that the terms on which the commission as administrator de bonis non is to issue, confines him to what is technically and at common law unadministered assets. Those terms are, \u201cAnd if it shall so happen that any executor shall die intestate, not having fully performed his executorship, or any administrator shall depart this life, not having fully administered the goods of the intestate, it shall be lawful, &c. to grant certificate for obtaining letters of administration of the goods not administered.\u201d Then follows the clause declaring the effect of probates and administrations, as above mentioned. It is said, that these terms bring the case within what is technically an administration de bonis non in England, and the clause was intended to repeal, and did repeal the Act of 1661; so that thenceforth the administrator de bonis non should not call for the accounts, as by that Act directed, and as had been done for fifty years.\nIn the first place, I am not clear that it is brought within the technical language of the commission of an administrator de bonis non. But, if the policy of the Act of *1661, so far it provided for the accountability now under consideration, was extended to executors, as well as administrators, by the Act of 1705, then it will not follow that the Act of 1711 repealed or altered that policy, unless it also repealed the Act o\u00ed 1705; and I supposed that this would also be contended for, but it has not.\nLet us see how the law stood in 1710. An administrator de bonis non, we will suppose, sues the executor of an executor, to recover the fund in question, under the Act of 178S, in order to pay debts; but, it is alleged by the executor of the executor, that the Act does not authorise such suit. I think it would have been answered by the Court in such case, \u201cHere is the Act of 1661, under which, for fifty years, the administrator de bonis non has recovered a similar fund from the executor or administrator of the administrator. It was the intention of the Legislature to extend the policy of that law, not only to the case of an executor as well as that of an administrator, but to other cases of persons having orphans\u2019 estates. This Act was not intended to repeal that of 1661, except so far as re-enacting its policy, and extending it, as aforesaid, repeals it. They must, therefore, be considered as Acts in pari materia, and as having the same object; and, therefore, the action will lie. It ought to lie for another reason. If an executor wastes and dies, it is a wrong which dies with him, and creditors may be injured; and as the Legislature has not provided that this action shall survive, we will consider that they have made this provision, so as in that way to secure creditors; and we will not presume the contrary ; *especiall}' as the c\u00e1se of the administrator is combined in the same clause with that of the executor, and the words themselves cannot bear any reasonable interpretation but this. Tor, how is this fund to go back to the estate of the deceased; except it g'oes to him who has a right to that estate, to wit, the administrator de bonis non?\u201d\nSuppose that there was such a decision of the Courts of that day reported, or found in their records; could we say it was a bad decision, or a wrong construction of these Acts; and that this fund ought to stand out, until the Legislature might thereafter make some provision to enable creditors to sue for it, or until legatees and distributees came of age and recovered it, and against whom creditors could go?' I would say, that it was a most correct decision, a most fair and just interpretation of the laws, and an advancement of justice, not only for the reasons which may thus be supposed to have influenced such Court, but for this further reason. Not only the law of 1661, but that of 1705, makes this claim against the estate of the executor or administrator, one of the first dignity; and if it is to remain unsettled,' whether the estate of such executor or administrator is or is not chargeable, on account of the trusteeship, until children of tender years shall be able to assert their claims, (for creditors, if there be any, and if they could, are not obliged, to resort to that fund,) no debts due from that estate can be paid with safety. The executor of the executor must come in by bill of conformity, bring in tne creditors, the administrator de bonis non, the infants, by their guardians, &c. in order to ascertain what is the sum so due, and to be first paid.\nSuppose he does, and that sum is ascertained, to whom will it be decreed? To the guardian of the distributees, when the administrator de bonis non wants it to pay debts, to reimburse his own advancements for the estate, &c.? Or to him, for these purposes, and afterwards for distribution? Surely, I think, it would be decreed to 'him.\n*If this was the law in 1710; if the executor or administrator of an executor, could then be called to account by the administrator de bonis non; then nothing is gained to the present question, by proving that the Act of 1661 is repealed by that of 1711. That must also repeal the Act of 1705, or the accountability still continued.\nIt is true there is no reported decision, as early as 1710, on this subject; nor have I examined the records of the Courts to see that such has been the practice. But this, I can say, I believe with confidence; that from 1661 until 1705, (44 years) if any administrator died in Virginia, not having obtained his quietus, and there was a second administration granted, *hat administrator called the executors and administrators of the first administrator to account for any assets converted, and not paid away in debts: that as creditors had not then, nor for many years thereafter, any remedy at law reaching such fund, it was a just and salutary law and practice; and I believe I may also with like confidence say, that from 1705 until 1825, (a space of 120 years more,) it has been the constant practice for the administrator de bonis non to call, as well the executor or administrator of an executor, as the executor or administrator of an administrator to account; and that such right never has been disputed, until the argument of this cause; and I think that these facts must be equal to a reported case, under the Act of 1705, of such decision as I have above supposed.\nTor these reasons, then, the Act of 1711 did not repeal or alter that feature of the Act of 1661, now under consideration ; and of course, could not repeal the same feature as re-enacted in 1705.\nBut the Act of 1711 is not to be construed, at this day, as repealing those Acts, for another reason. The compilation of 1733, made under the sanction of the Legislature, (as the title page shews,) contains in it as well the Act of 1705 as that of 1711, as subsisting laws. It is true, the Act of 1661 is noted by its title, and said to be repealed, *and by the Act of 1711. But, this note is not to be considered as a statute repealing it because of its improper policy; otherwise, its policy in declaring the dignity of the demand in question, would be repealed. It is no more a repeal or alteration of the policy in this respect, than a similar note in the compilation of 17S2, opposite the Act of 1711 above mentioned, repealed its policy. That statute is there marked \u201cRap\u2019d.\u201d and by the Act of 1748, which also has a repealing clause, and may be said to have repealed the Act of 1711; but it is repealed merely on the ground, that this latter statute embraced its provisions as to granting probates and administrations; and in this same way, that of 17\u00cd1 may be supposed to have repealed that of 1661, as to administrations de bonis non, but no further. All laws which may thus be considered as virtually repealed, are always taken into construction as in pari materia, in case of any doubt. Suppose the Act of 170S had not contained in it a provision in relation to the priority of these claims, and that had stood on the Act of 1661. Would the statute of 1711 have repealed that provision? Certainly not; fcr, it would not have been within the purview of the Act. That Act merely Intended to point out \u201cthe manner of granting probates,\u201d &c., not to prescribe the remedies of executors or administrators. This matter of priority of claim, as well as of accountability, regards their remedies, and would not have been repealed, or the Act of 170S, which continues the same matter in this respect, ought also to have been considered as repealed.\nThat branch, then, of the Act of 1661, was either re-enacted or repealed by the Act of 1705, not by the Act of 1711; though the other branch of the Act, and which fell within the purview, was repealed, or rather its policy re-enacted and enlarged by that Act. This, I think, is the only sound construction that can be put on those statutes.\nIt is a little remarkable, that even the power to grant a commission of administration de bonis non seems not expressly to be given since the Act of 1748, though it is occasionally incidentally spoken of. But the constant practice has been, and is, to grant them. Could it be said, at this day, that this power in the Courts does not exist?\nSo in 1748, (to be found in the compilation of 1752, p. 229,) a similar statute to that of 1705, is passed, extending its provision's to the case of a guardian, who had not been named before. So, also, in the compilation of 1769, this same law of 1705, and the one last mentioned, are both inserted as subsisting laws; and so the matter stood until 1785.\nIf I am correct, then, in my understanding and interpretation of the Act of 1705, as well the executor or administrator of an executor, as the executor or administrator of an administrator, was accountable to the administrator de bonis non, from 1705 until 1785, (a space of 80 years,) as the latter had been for 40 years before, and were so constantly sued and brought to account. This, I understand, to be admitted to have been the practice; whilst, at the same time, though there may; be a case, yet I can find no trace of any, where a creditor has taken his remedy under the statute in his favor.\nIn the Act of 1748, chap. 5, sec. 22, which impliedly repealed that of 1711, as, before mentioned, it is declared that ail commissions, probates, &c. issued, &c. and signed by the Governor, &c. shall empower and enable executors or administrators to possess themselves of the estates of their testators or intestates, by any lawful ways or means whatever. If the amount due from a former executor or administrator, is a part of the estate of the deceased, as understood in our laws, and subject to pay debLs, legacies, and for distribution, the payment and performance of all which belong to the duties of the administrator de bonis non, (as appears by the Statute of Distributions, which directs that after debts, funeral, and just expenses, &c. the surplus of all and singular the goods and personal estate shall be distributed, &c. ;) how can it be said that such commission cannot extend to it? I confess I am utterly unable to say that it shall not.\n^Although the Act of 1785, chap. 61, which extends the principle so as to embrace not only executors, administrators and guardians, but committees of idiots and lunatics, makes a change in the phraseology, by declaring that the executor or administrator of the person so chargeable, shall pay so much as shall be due to the ward, idiot or lunatic, or to the legatee or person entitled to distribution, before any proper debt, &c. ; it cannot be supposed that the object was to change what had theretofore been considered the settled law and practice. I say so, because no such change is indicated, except by a slight change in phraseology. It was not intended, surely, to cut out creditors; and if that law was intended to take away the surplus from executors, and thus to remove one reason why the administrator de bonis non should not have the action, it can hardly be supposed to intend any change ifi the practice on this subject, as to him. I say so the more confidently, for this further reason, that so far from any grievance under the former practice existing, which that Act may be said to remedy, that same practice has gone on yet forty years more, since that Act, without mischief or complaint, that we have heard oi ; successive Legislatures, after distant periods, re-enacting and extending the principle, without any declared intention to alter a practice, which must have been so well known and understood.\nThis Act of 1785, also introduces a feature into our laws, which has been, from time to time, much extended, and which seems to me to have a strong bearing on the other branch of the enquiry; as it seems to me to cut up almost every suit at law, which might have been brought by creditors under the statute aforesaid. It declares that no surety of an executor or administrator shall be answerable for any omission or mistake in pleading, &c. ; and the Act cf 1806 provides, that the executor or administrator himself shall not be liable for false pleading, non-pleading, mispleading, &c. in any action then pending or there after to be brought, &c.; provided that judgment may be given, so far as assets *may be found in his hands. This provision is not only in the Act of 1819, but it further provides a remedy, which surely is better than that given before, if that was restricted to a suit on a judgment as I have before contended, by enabling a creditor, after obtaining a judgment against an executor or administrator, to bring suit on the official bond against the executor or administrator, and his sureties, or either of them, or the executors or administrators of either of them, &c.\nIf an executor of an executor is not liable to be sued, except when a devastavit has been established by a judgment fixing such devastavit, (as I hold to be undoubted law ;) and as there will be few cases indeed, in which such devastavit will hereafter be established by the first judgment; this last Act, giving a remedy on the official bond, will, I think, forever put an end to any use, which the creditors might wish to make of the statute, and which, even without this alternate remedy, has remained, I believe, a dead letter in our statute book, for upwards of a century.\nThus, at a period of our legislation, when every reason for a change of practice has, from time to time, been more and more taken from under us, and when the remedy of the creditor under our former statute always doubtful and surrounded by. difficulties, has become entirely useless and unnecessary, (a better one being given to him) we are to interpose on some supposed legal right that he has to our interposition, so as to uphold his claim under a statute never to be resorted to, and change a practice of ISO years standing, which, to say the least of it, has some plausible ground of law to stand on.\nBut say that an executor may, notwithstanding the Act of 1785, be still entitled to the surplus, and that he also is entitled to our protection. If so, and the administrator de bonis non calls on his representative for the fund in question, and which he would necessarily do by a suit in Chancery ; might not that Court only, and from time to time, *decree what was necessary for the payment of debts? If a creditor sues for it at law, he will recover the fund, although there may be enough in the hands of the administrator de bonis non to satisfy him. It would therefore be more just, even on this score, that the administrator de bonis non, and not the creditor, should get the fund.\nOn the whole. I can see no reason for changing our practice; and it seems to me, it is one of those cases, in which it may be better to do too little than too much. In Dykes v. Woodhouse, we did not go according to what may be the British practice; but looking to our own statutes, and the reason and nature of the case, gave the scire facias, or action of debt, to the administrator de bonis non.\nI think, therefore, the process was properly issued, and ought not to be quashed.\nJUDGE) CABELL.\nThis case was elaborately and ably argued by the counsel, and has been fully discussed by the Judges who have preceded me. I also have considered with .very great attention, the arguments and authorities adduced; but, I must acknowledge that I have not experienced any difficulty on the subject; which appears to me to depend on a f.ew plain and obvious principles.\nThe powers of an administrator de bonis non, must depend on his commission. That commission, in England, is confined to the goods not administered by his predecessor. Bac. Abr. vol. 3, p. 19, 20. Now, although, in some cases, a question may be raised as to what shall, or what shall not amount to an administration, yet it never has been doubted in England, that when an administrator wastes the goods of his intestate, or converts them to his own use, that is an administration. Being an administrator of the goods by the former administrator, it is without the commission of the administrator de bonis non. And, accordingly, it is admitted on all hands, that the practice *in England, (founded no doubt on this principle,) has invariably been for the creditor and distributee of the first intestate, and not the administrator de bonis non, to prosecute the representatives of the first administrator for any waste or misapplication of the assets by that administrator.\nSuch being the law and the practice in England, let us see whether our Legislature has adopted the same or a different system. It is true, that at a very early period of our history, (in the year 1661,) when our Code afforded nothing like a matured system of legislation on the subjects of the probate of wills, and grants of administration, there was a law, 2 Hen. Stat. 92, which provides, that if an administrator died before he had given an account of the estate, and obtained his quietus, the Court shouid*be \u201cempowered to grant the administration of that estate so not accounted for, to some other person, who may, by virtue thereof, call the heirs, executors, or administrators of the former administrator to an account, who shall pay out of the said deceased administrator\u2019s estate, all such debts as shall be found due to the estate he administered upon, in. the first place.\u201d\nIf this law were now in force, there could be no doubt that the administrator would have the power contended for. But, that law was repealed more than a century ago, and has never been re-enacted.\nIn the year 1711, the Legislature matured and adopted a complete system upon the subject of the grant of administrations, and instead of the provision in the Act of 1661, above referred to, adopted the following: (See 4 Hen. Stat. 14,) \u201cAnd if it shall so happen that any executor shall die intestate, not having fully performed his executorship, or any administrator shall depart this life, not having fully administered the goods of the intestate; in every such case, it shall and may be lawful for the Court that granted the certificate for obtaining such probate or commission of administration, to hear and determine the right of administration, and to grant certificate for obtaining letters of administration *of the goods not administered, to such person as. by this Act shall have right thereto.\u201d That it was intended, by this law, to repeal the Act of 1661, is a subject on which I cannot doubt. In the first place, the two Acts (relating to the power of the administrator de bonis non,) are inconsistent with each other; and in the second place, all former laws \u201ccoming within the purview of this Act,\u201d are expressly repealed. In fact, there could have been no other object for introducing this provision in the Act of 1711, but to repeal the Act of 1661; for, the power to grant administrations de bonis non, would necessarily result from_ the general power to grant letters of administration. And accordingly, we find, that in the edition of the laws published under the authority of the Legislature, about twenty years afterwards, viz: in 1733, the Act of 1661, is given by its title only, as one that was repealed by the Act of 1711.\nIt is very worthy of remark, that our Legislature, in repealing the Act of 1661, and in providing for the appointment of a second administrator, have adopted the very terms used in \"England, as descriptive of the administrator de bonis non. This was not an accidental circumstance. It was the effect of a design to make our laws conform to those of England, the policy of which has been tested by long and approved experience. By this law, the commission of an administrator de bonis non is, in this country, precisely the same that it is in England. It is this commission that must determine his rights and powers; and looking at this commission, I cannot see how it is possible to claim for him greater rights and powers, than have been assigned to him by the decision of the English Courts. Those decisions have my entire approbation.\nIt is said, however, that a different practice has always prevailed in this country. This may be so. or it may not be so; for, the evidence on the subject does not enable me to pronounce anv positive opinion upon it. It is true, that in the case of Spols-wood v. Dandridge, the Special Court *of Appeals said that an administrator de bonis non had the powers now claimed for him. But I well remember that the point was not considered by the Court. This is the first time that the propriety of any practice on the subject, has been brought to the deliberate consideration of the Court; and I cannot sanction any practice that is against the law, however long it may have been pursued.\nI am clearly of opinion, that an administrator de bonis non has no right to call to account the represenlative of a deceased administrator, for a waste or misapplication of the assets; and consequently, that the scire facias heretofore awarded in this case should be quashed, as having been improvidentlv awarded, and that the appeal should be abated.\n\u2020\nThe President absent.\n*\nNote by J\u00fcdge Carr. When these remarks were written, I had not seen the revisal of 1733. My brother Cabell has since turned my attention to it, and I find it containing' such complete evidence of the repeal of the Act of 1SB1-2. by that of 1711. as would have saved me the trouble of the above remarks, had it been known to me. This revisal is' contained in a single volume, entitled thus: \u201cA collection of all the Acts of Assembly now in force in the Colony of Virginia, (with the titles of such as are expired or repealed, and notes in the margin, how and at what time, they were repealed,) examined with the record by a committee appointed for that purpose, who have added many useful marginal notes and references, and an exact table. Published, pursuant to an order of the General Assembly held in williamsburg, in 1737.\u201d In this volume, we have the title of the Act of 1661-2. to wit: \u201cAdministrations, to whom to be granted;\u201d followed by the word \"Repealed:\u201d and in the margin the following words: \u201cRepealed, chap. 2d, 1711;\u201d the very law, which I have contended above did repeal it. If stronger evidence could be necessary, than the Acts themselves afford, it is thus furnished.\n*\nNote by .'Judge Coai\/tkk. It is not clear to me. that if an executor had converted every thing- to his own use, and had paid neither debt nor legacy, and dies, that he has performed his executorship r or that an administrator, if he has in like maimer converted and died, without paying debts or making distribution, that he has fully administered the goods of his intestate; though it may be that he has technically administered them. There areno words confining the grant of administration to this technical administration; as. that it shall be granted of the goods which were of the intestate, and which remains unadministered. No. The obiect was, that the administrator de bonis non should, as theretofore, possess himself of the means to perform the will, as the executor ought to have done, and to administer fully, not technically, the estate of theintestate. This was conformable to the spirit of the law of 1681, and of 1705. which then had been long in force and practised under, and the policy of which is thus impliedly sanctioned, not repealed. But, if a mere technical common law commission was intended to he issued, still I do not think that would necessarily he a repeal of that branch of this section, which relates to the priority of the claim, or the accountability of the representative of the administrator, even if neither of them had been incorporated in the Act of 1705. To bring that subject within the purview, it must appear that there is something in the body of the Act opposed to the policy of the previous law. that it was intended by the Act to operate on this matter. That is attempted. by insisting that a technical common law commission is opposed to it; but that is not so. If the law had theretofore declared that goods wasted should no more be considered as administered, than goods remaining in kind, the common law commission would as well enable the administrator de bonis non to go into equity for these, as for assets that have been converted at law, though not in equity. But this was in fact the law, as it then stood, and which, I think this very clause recognizes as the law. The repeal, then, only went to that branch of the law, which imperfectly gave administration de bonis non, and which was there more fully and completely provided for."},{"case_name":"MAURO et al. v. RITCHIE","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6669227\/","date":"1827-05-01","court":"United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia","content":"CRANCH, Chief Judge.\nOn the 13th of September, 1826, Joseph Forrest and Philip Mauro, by J. Marbury, \u201ctheir attorney,\u201d applied to the orphans\u2019 court for leave to file their petition, praying that court to review its order, granting to John T. Ritchie the guardianship of John W. Ott, to whom the petitioners had been appointed guardians in the year 1821; and that the said John T. Ritchie may be cited to answer the prayer of the petitioners. Whereupon that court ordered that leave be given as prayed, and that a citation be issued against the said Ritchie, returnable to the 20th of September, 1826. The petition was accordingly filed, stating the appointment of the petitioners as joint guardians of John W. Ott; that they gave bond, &c.; that the said John W. Ott is still under age, being about fourteen years old, and still subject'to their control and care; that on the 9th of August, 1825, John T. Ritchie, (\u201cwho, your orators pray, may be made defendant to this bill of review,\u201d) made application to be appointed guardian to the said orphan, and filed a letter from the said orphan, dated from Frederick city, in the state of Maryland, on the 14th of July, 1825, directed to the judge of the orphans\u2019 court of the county of Washington, in the District of Columbia, in which he represents himself to be fourteen years of age, and states that he chooses the said J. T. Ritchie as his guardian, and requests that he may be appointed. Whereupon the judge of the orphans\u2019 court, without notice to the petitioners, without having caused the orphan to be brought into court, and without further evidence, or other proceeding, by a decretal order appointed the said J. T. Ritchie guardian of the infant, which decretal order is signed and enrolled; that they are aggrieved thereby, and that it is erroneous, and ought to be reversed and annulled. And they assign for error: (1) Because the petitioners were appointed guardians under Act 1798, c. 101, c. 12, \u00a7 1, which gives the court power to appoint a guardian for an infant until the age of twenty-one, and that having exercised that, power, by appointing the petitioners guardians of the infant till his age of twenty-one, it was not competent for the judge to remove the petitioners and appoint a new guardian except for cause shown, in the omission or neglect of duty, &c.; and if such neglect, were alleged, the petitioners were entitled to be cited and heard. (2) Because the infant had no right, at the age of fourteen, to choose a guardian, having had guardians appointed until he should be twenty-one years of age. (3) Because the infant was not brought into court, and under the inspection and examination of the judge; that his age, competency to choose, and wish might be distinctly known to the judge. (4) Because the petitioners were not cited to show cause why they should not be removed, and the said Ritchie appointed guardian. (5) Because the petitioners had no notice of the application and appointment of the said Ritchie until after the said order was made, and had no opportunity to object to the same. \u201cFor all which errors in the said decretal order your orators have brought this bill ,of review, and humbly conceive that they should be relieved therein. In tender consideration whereof, and for that there are divers errors and imperfections in the said decretal order and proceedings, by reason whereof the same ought to be reviewed and reversed, &c.; and to the end that the same may be reviewed and reversed, &c., and that the said J. T. Ritchie may answer, &c., and that your orators may be relieved according to equity and good conscience, may it please your honor to grant your orators a subpoena to the said J. T. Ritchie,\u201d &c., and they file a record of the proceedings referred to. The said J. T. Ritchie appeared on the 20th of September, 1826, and prayed further time to answer, which was given to the 27th, when he appeared by Mr. Swann his solicitor, and said, \u201cthat the bill of review7, so as aforesaid exhibited against him, and the matter therein contained, are not sufficient in law to compel him to answer the said bill,\u201d &c. \u201c\"wherefore for want of a sufficient bill in this case the said John prays that the said bill may be dismissed,\u201d &c. And the said Joseph and Philip, by J. Marbury their attorney, say that the bill, &c., is sufficient in law, &c. &<;.\nThe cause having been submitted to the judge of the orphans\u2019 court, without argument, he decreed that the prayer of the petition could not be granted, and that the petition be dismissed with costs. Upon which decree the petitioners appealed to this court.\nThe original order, appointing the petitioners guardians, was in these words: \u201cMarch 21, 1821. Catharine Ott having declined the appointment of guardian to the infant children of her son, the late Doctor John Ott, it is by the court this day ordered, that Joseph Forrest and Philip Mauro, both of said county and district, be appointed joint guardians of the said orphan children of Doctor John Ott, deceased, they entering into a bond of $20,000, for each guardianship, with William Cooper and Hanson Gassaway securities.\u201d On the 9th of August, 1825, John T. Ritchie made application to the court to be. appointed guardian to John W. Ott, and filed the following letter: \u201cFrederick City, Frederick County, July 14th, 1825. To the Honorable Mr. Lee, Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court for \u25a0 Washington County, in the District of Columbia. Honorable Sir, \u2014 X beg leave hereby to make known to you that 1 am the son of Doctor John Ott, late of Georgetown, in the District of Columbia, deceased, and am above the age of fourteen years, but under twenty-one; and I do choose for my guardian, my uncle, John T. Ritchie, of Georgetown aforesaid; and do hereby make application to you, sir, and request that you will be pleased to appoint him my guardian; that thereby he may possess and exercise the right of protection to myself and the property that has descended to me. With great respect, I remain your most obedient servant, John W. Ott.\u201d On the back of which letter was the following affidavit: \u201cMaryland, Frederick County, ss. On the 14th day of July, 1825, personally appears John W. Ott, son of Doctor John Ott, late of Georgetown, in the District of Columbia, deceased, the individual whose signature is attached to the within letter, before the subscriber, a justice of the peace in and for said county; and the said John W. Ott, being by me privately examined apart from and out of the hearing of all persons whomsoever, declares that he had written the within letter for the purpose of having it delivered to the Honorable Judge Lee as thereby directed, with the view to procure the appointment of his uncle, John T. Ritchie, to be his guardian, and that he has not been induced to choose his said uncle to become his guardian by threat or ill usage of his said uncle, or of any other person, or through his or their displeasure. Witness my hand, George Rohr.\u201d\nIt is noted on the record of the orphans\u2019 court, that the court delivered an elaborate written opinion, concluding with a decree that the petition of Forrest and Mauro be dismissed with costs. It appears from that opinion, the substance of which was published in the National Intelligencer of the 25th of December, 1826, that although the counsel of Mr. Ritchie objected to the court\u2019s opening the case upon this bill of review, yet the court did open it; and did reconsider and-confirm its former decree; and the question whether that court had power thus to review its decree is to be Considered as reserved for the appellate court. The appeal from the original decree appointing Mr. Ritchie guardian, was dismissed by this court at May term, 1S26, because the transcript of the record was not transmitted within thirty days after the decree. It is now contended by the counsel of Mr. Ritchie that the present appeal is to the refusal of the orphans\u2019 court to review its former decree, and not to the decree which in effect affirmed its former decree; so that the only question now before this court, as they contend, is, whether the orphans\u2019 court erred in refusing to reconsider its former decree. But the elaborate opinion of that court shows that it did review its former decree, and that it was because it found that decree to be correct that it passed the decree for dismissing the petition of Forrest and Mauro. The former decree was reviewed, and in fact affirmed. Does the appeal from this last decree bring before this court the question whether the former decree was correct? If it does, and if this court should be of opinion that the first decree was erroneous, and that the orphans\u2019 court, upon the review or rehearing, ought to have reversed that decree, is it competent for this court to reverse it? If the orphans\u2019 court, in its discretion, had a right to review or rehear the cause, and did review or rehear it, we suppose no one will doubt the right of either party to appeal from the new decree made at the rehearing.\nThe first question, then, is, whether the orphans\u2019 court had a right, circumstanced as the cause then was, to grant a rehearing, or to review its decree. It is said that the proceedings of the orphans\u2019 court are analogous to those of a court of chancery, and that by the rules of that court a cause cannot be reheard after the decree has been enrolled; and that it is considered as enrolled after the expiration of the term in which the decree was rendered. To this it is answered, that the orphans\u2019 court has no terms. It sits every day, or whenever the judge thinks proper. That its decrees are never, in fact, enrolled, and are only to be found in the paper minutes of the court. That the court is not bound by the rules of the chancery court; and if it were, yet in courts of chancery a rehearing is often had after the term in which the decree is pronounced, and is always within the discretion of the court, who will, and often have set aside the enrolment for the purpose of letting in a party to a rehearing. 1 Har. Ch. Prac. 649, and to this effect were cited tlie case of Travis v. Waters, 1 Johns. Ch. 48; and Consequa v. Fanning, 3 Johns. Ch. 364. See also the case of Mills v. Banks, 3 P. Wms. 1, 8, where a cause was reheard after a lapse of eighteen years, and where the chancellor says that a rehearing is in the discretion of the court, and is not always a matter of right; and in one case, where the decree was not enrolled, the court refused to discharge an order for a rehearing, although at the distance of about twenty-four years. The principal difference between a rehearing and a review, is in this, that a rehearing may be had before enrolment of the decree; but after enrolment the party is put to his bill of review, which, if it be founded upon new matter of fact, discovered since the closing of the commission to examine witnesses, cannot be filed without leave granted upon petition; but if it be founded upon error in matter of law apparent upon the record, no such previous permission of the court is necessary. In the latter case, \u201cthe constant method is to put in a plea, and demur, namely, a plea of the decree, and a demurrer against opening the enrolment; and an answer is rarely required, unless the same be ordered by the court; so that in effect a bill of review cannot be brought without leave of the court, in some shape; for if it be founded upon matter apparent in the body of the decree, then, upon the plea and demurrer, the court judge whether there are any grounds for opening the enrolment; and if upon matter of fact newly discovered, the court, upon the petition for leave to file the bill, will judge whether there be any foundation for such leave.\u201d 1 Har. Ch. Frac. 170.\nThe court, then, had a right to review its decree. In the present case, leave was granted \u201cto file a petition, praying the court to review its order, in granting to John T. Ritchie the guardianship of John W. Ott.\u201d This petition was analogous to a bill of review in chancery, and points out the errors in law apparent upon the record for which it alleges that the decree ought to be reversed. It admits that the decree had been signed and enrolled, and prays that it may be reviewed and reversed. To this bill, or petition, the defendant, Mr. Ritchie, was cited to answer; and, having appeared, filed a general demurrer; to which there was a general replication and joinder. The decree of the orphans\u2019 court thereupon was, that the prayer of the petition cannot be granted, and that the petition be dismissed, with costs. This decree must be referred to the demurrer, and considered as a judgment in favor of the defendant, upon the issue of law joined by the parties; and cannot be considered as the mere exercise of the discretion of the court in refusing to' review its decree, or to rehear the cause. That discretion was exercised, and perhaps expended in the order for leave to file the bill of review. The decree is, in effect, a judgment that the errors, suggested in the bill of review as apparent on the record, were not such as ought to have induced the orphans\u2019 court to reverse its decree appointing Mr. Ritchie guardian to John W. Ott. The parties had, by the demurrer and joinder, submitted to the court a matter of law, (of right,) not of discretion. The court decided the matter of right, and the parties, aggrieved by the decree, have appealed to this court. The question, then, upon this appeal, is, whether that matter of law, (or right,) thus put in issue by the parties, has been correctly decided by the orphans\u2019 court.\nThe bill of review states five grounds of error: (1) That the petitioners, Forrest and Mauro, had, by a previous order of the court, been appointed guardians of John W. Ott, by virtue of the first section of the 12th chapter, Act 179S, c. 101, and that it was not competent for the court to remove them, except for cause shown, in the omission or neglect of some duty; nor without being cited and heard. (2) That the orphan, having had a guardian appointed for him until the age of 21, had no right, at the age of 14, to choose a guardian. (3) That he was not brought into court to choose his guardian. (4) That the petitioners were not cited to show cause why they should not be removed; and (5) That they had no notice-of the application and appointment of Mr. Ritchie, until after he was appointed.\n1. By the 1st section of the 12th chapter of Act 179S, c. 101, it is enacted, \u201cthat whenever land shall descend, or be devised to a male under the age of 21 years, or to a female under 16,\u201d \u201cand the said male or female shall not have a natural guardian, or guardian appointed by last will, agreeably to the statute in that case made and provided,\u201d (12 Car. II. c. 24,) \u201cthe orphans' court shall have power to appoint a guardian to such infant until the age of twenty-one years, if a male, and until the age of sixteen, if a female, or marriage.\u201d Under this clause of the statute, the petitioners Forrest and Mauro were, in 1821, appointed joint guardians of the infant children of Dr. Ott As the court had power to appoint them guardians until the full age of the infants, and as they were appointed generally, without limitation of time, their authority continues until the infants respectively attain that age, unless it be lawfully revoked by the court The orphans\u2019 court has no express power, under the statute, to remove a guardian, or to revoke the appointment, except in the single case of his refusing to give security when required; and by the 20th section of the 15th chapter of Act 1798, c. 101, it is enacted, \u201cThat the orphans\u2019 court shall not, under any pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction whatever, not expressly given by that act, or some other law.\u201d If it claim jurisdiction to remove a guardian for any other cause, it must claim it as a jurisdiction incidental to the power of appointment. But all incidental jurisdiction is expressly forbidden by the statute. The orphans\u2019 court, therefore, had no power to remove the guardians, or to revoke their authority, they never having refused to give the seeuritv required.\n2.But it has teen contended that an infant has a common-law privilege of choosing a guardian at the age of fourteen, and that this privilege has been \u201csanctioned by the uniform usage, in England and this country,'of a Thousand years;\u201d that it is \u201ca solemn, immemorial right;\u201d and that the statute, when it authorized the court to appoint a guardian until the infant should attain the age of twenty-one years, meant to say, \u201cunless the orphan, after he shall arrive to the age of fourteen years, shall object to such appointment, and ask permission to choose another guardian.\u201d But it was not contended that this was an absolute right to choose a guardian; but a right to be exercised under the \u201csurveillance\u201d of the court; for it was admitted that the court would not appoint the person nominated by the orphan if he \u201cwere non compos, convicted of an infamous crime, or notoriously dissolute and immoral; nor unless he gave ample security for the faithful discharge of his trust.\u201d The statute does not in the slightest manner recognize, or allude to, the right of the infant to choose his guardian; but by giving the court an absolute power to appoint a guardian till twenty-one, evidently negatives the idea of any such right; for such a right is inconsistent with the power given to the court. But it seems to have been taken for granted that, by the common law, the infant had a right to choose his guardian in all cases. This is not true. When there was a guardian in chivalry, or by nature, or by statute, the infant had no right to choose. It was only when there was a guardian in socage, or for nurture, in which cases the guardianship continued only till the age of 14, that' the infant\u2019s right of election existed.\nBy the law of England there are various kinds of guardians: (1) Guardian in chivalry; (2) in socage; (3) by nature; (4) for nurture: (these four were by the common law); (5) by the statute of 4 & 5 Phil. & M. c. S, and 12 Car. II. c. 24, g 8, by which statutes the father has a right, by deed or last will, to dispose of the custody of his infant children until their age of 21. or for a less time, and these are called \u201ctestamentary,\u201d and sometimes \u201cstatutory\u201d guardians; (0) guardians by the custom of particular manors, cities, &e.; (7) guardians appointed by the lord chancellor, exercising, in this respect, the royal prerogative of parens pa-triae; (8) guardians appointed by the ecclesiastical courts; (9) guardians ad litem,\"ap-pointed by any court in which the interests of an infant are litigated (3 Bl. Comm. 426; Harg. Co. Litt. 88b, note 16); these are, in general, only appointed pro hac vice, and continue only until such interest is finally disposed of by the court; (10) guardians by election.\n1. Guardian in chivalry existed only when the infant inherited lands holden by knight\u2019s service. This guardian had the custody of the person and lands of the infant until his full age of twenty-one, and took the profits to his own use without account; and also the value of the marriage of his ward. The infant had no right to elect a guardian. This tenure was abolished by the statute 12 Car. II. c. 24, and with the tenure went the right of guardianship connected with that tenure.\n2. Guardianship in socage arose, like that in chivalry, wholly out of tenure. It was necessary that the ward should have inherited lands holden in socage. It continued only until the heir attained the age of fourteen, although some have said that it continued until the age of twenty-one, unless the ward, after his age of fourteen, should have elected another guardian. King v. Pierson, And. 313; Lit. \u00a7 123; Byrne v. Van Hoesen, 5 Johns. 67. The guardian in socage had the custody of the person and of the lands; but wholly for the benefit of the ward. The guardian in socage must be the next of kin, to whom the lands of the infant cannot by any possibility descend.\n3. Guardianship by nature, existed only where the ward was heir apparent of the guardian, and extended only to the person of the ward. The father was always guardian by nature of the person of his heir apparent, even when the infant inherited lands holden by knight\u2019s service, and where the lord was guardian of the estate. Guardianship by nature continued until the full age of twenty-one; and the infant had no right to elect a guardian. This guardianship did not extend to -the younger children who were not heirs apparent. Guardian by nature has no right to the custody of the infant\u2019s estate. H. St. G. Tucker\u2019s notes on 1 Bl. Comm. 461.\n4. Guardianship for nurture extended only to the custody of the persons of those infants who are not heirs apparent, and continued only until their age of fourteen years, and none could have it but the father or mother. It only occurs where the infant is without any other guardian. After fourteen the infant is at liberty to choose his guardian. How this election is to be made, at common law, does not appear in any book that we have consulted.\nThe court of chancery, exercising, in regard to infants, the prerogative of the king as parens patriae, will appoint guardians whenever such appointment is necessary for the purpose of protecting the infant\u2019s general interest, or for the purpose of sustaining a suit, or of* consenting to the marriage of the infant. In re Woolscombe, 1 Madd. 213. But it could never have been required, by the common law, that all the infants in the kingdom who had not guardians provided by the common law, should be brought into the court of chancery, to obtain them. The ecclesiastical courts have claimed a right to appoint curators or guardians, as to legacies, and distributive shares of the personal estates of intestates, and this right has been admitted by the common-law courts; but their right to meddle with the persons of infants has been denied both by chancellors and by common-law judges. 4 Burn, Ecc. Law, 88, 91; Banes v. Lowder, 3 Keb. 834; Bishop of Carlisle v. Wells, 3 Jones, 90, 2 Lev. 162; Buck v. Draper, 3 Atk. 631; Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burrows, 1436. There is a dictum of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke in 2 Ves. Sr. 375, that \u201csupposing there was no testamentary guardian, nor a mother, if the infant has any socage land, and is of the age of twelve, if female, or of fourteen, if male, they are allowed to choose their guardian; as is frequently done on the circuit, and is the constant practice, and what this court frequently calls on infants to do; though this is still liable to any reasonable objection made to such choice.\u201d Mr. Har-grave, in note 16 to Co. Litt. 88b, understands the expression \u201con circuit\u201d to mean before a judge on the circuit. We have not found this practice alluded to in any other book, unless it be in Style, 456; but it is so explicitly stated by Lord Hardwicke that we must take it to be so; and it is probable that the appearance of the infant, and his choice, with the approbation of the court, were entered upon the minutes of the court, and constituted the only evidence of the title of the guardian thus chosen. This practice is, by Lord Hardwicke, confined to the case where the infant has socage land; and probably to the case where there had been a guardian in socage, which could only be where the infant took by descent. A person cannot strictly be said to have land -unless he has a freehold estate; for none but a freeholder can be tenant to the precipe, or be the owner of real estate. Where an infant had land by purchase, and not by descent; or where he had only personal property, it does not appear that a guardian could be elected or appointed before a judge on the circuit.\nThe right of the ecclesiastical courts to appoint a curator of guardian for the personal estate, is probably no more than the right of every court to appoint a guardian ad litem (3 Salk. 177, pl. 14; 3 Burrows, 1436); for those courts, having jurisdiction as to wills and legacies, and the ordering of distribution of intestate estates, all legatees, and persons entitled to distributive portions of intestate estates, were parties before them; and if any of those parties were Infants, those courts, as every other court, would have had a right to appoint guardians ad litem to protect their interests, so long as they were pending before those courts, and to receive and apply the money or other property which they should receive under the orders of such courts, who would have a right also to take security from such guardians for the faithful execution of their trust. This is probably the only foundation of the power of the ecclesiastical courts to appoint guardians; and it will not support a claim to appoint a guardian for the person of the infant, (Loury v. Reynes, 2 Lev. 217,) or for his personal estate acquired in any other way than by bequest, or in the course of distribution. In the case of guardian for nurture it does not appear in what manner, or before whom The infant, when he attained the age of fourteen, was to make his election; it is probable, however, that it was to be made as in the ease of tenure by socage. Nor does it appear that an infant, by the law of England, had a right to choose a guardian in any case where a guardian had been appointed for him by any person having a discretion to choose, unless such appointment were expressly limited to the time of the infant\u2019s attaining the age of fourteen, which it is believed, in analogy to the rule of the common law in guardianship in socage and for nurture, was generally the case in appointments by the court of chancery, and by the ecclesiastical courts; after which age of fourteen they were generally permitted to nominate their guardians, and if the courts perceived no material objection, they appointed the guardians thus nominated. And. 313, 2 Lev. 217. After the statute of 12 Car. II. c. 24, which abolished tenures by knight's-service, almost all the tenures became tenures in socage, and. consequently, almost all guardianships as to lands, fell upon persons not personally chosen by anybody. It was right that these accidental guardianships should be removable at the age of discretion of the infant; but the same reason did not apply to guardians selected by any authority competent to choose persons well qualified to take care of the interest of the infant. Hence the statute of 12 Car. II. c. 24, \u00a7 8, authorized the father to appoint a guardian to his child until the age of twenty-one, without recognizing any right in the child to choose a guardian. This provision, Mr. Justice Blackstone seems to think, was made in consideration of the imbecility of judgment in children of the age of fourteen.\nOf the four kinds of guardianship at common law, it is believed that only one exists in this country, namely, guardianship by nature. Tenancy by knight\u2019s-service, and, consequently, guardianship in chivalry, never existed here, as the lands were, by charter, to be holden in free and common socage. Guardianship in socage cannot, since the Maryland statute of descents. 1786, c. 45, exist here, because there cannot be found any of kin to the infant, who may not, by possibility, inherit the land. Guardianship for nurture cannot exist here, because it is applicable only to such children as are not heirs apparent; and here all are, by that statute, heirs apparent, and,' consequently, guardianship by nature exists in this country, and applies to all the children. But a guardian by nature, at the common law, has no authority over the lands of the infant, and, perhaps, not over his personal estate; as it has been decided, both in England and in some of these states, that he has no right to receive a legacy bequeathed to his ward. See Harg. Co. Litt. 88b, and note 12; Genet v. Tallmadge, 1 Johns. Ch. 3; Anderson v. Darby, 1 Nott & McC. 369; May v. Calder, 2 Mass. 59; Strickland v. Hudson, 3 Rep. Ch. 168; Dagley v. Tolferry, 1 P. Wms. 285; Eq. Cas. Abr. 300, pl. 2; Gilb. Cas. 103; Philips v. Paget, 2 Atk. 80; Cooper v. Thornton, 3 Brown, Ch. 96, 186; Cunningham v. Harris, cited by the master of the rolls, in Cooper v. Thornton; Tucker\u2019s notes to 1 Bl. Comm. 462; 1 Vern, 295; 1 Johns. Cas. 217.\n5. Statutory guardianship. The statute of 4 & 5 Phil. & M. c. 8, which, by implication, gave the father a right to appoint a guardian, by deed or will, to his daughters until the age of sixteen, and upon the death of the father, without such appointment, gave the custody of the daughters to the mother; and the statute of 12 Car. II. c. 24, \u00a7 8, which authorized the father to appoint, by deed or will, a guardian for his infant children until their full age, were in force in Maryland; and the latter is expressly recognized and referred to in the testamentary system of Maryland of 1798 (chapters 101, 12, \u00a7 1). These statutes are now in force in this country, and such guardians may now be appointed by the father.\n6. Guardians by custom are unknown in this country.\n7. Guardians by appointment of the chancellor. The chancellor in Maryland, it is believed, never had the power of appointing guardians, except ad litem.\n8. Guardians by appointment of the ecclesiastical courts. No such courts exist in this country. The judge, or commissary-general, or deputy-commissaries, who exercised in Maryland the only remnant of ecclesiastical jurisdiction transferred to this country, had no such power. It was, by Act Md. 1715. c. 39, vested solely in the commissioners of the county courts, that is, the justices of the county courts.\n9. Guardianship ad litem. All the courts had power to appoint guardians ad litem, to protect the interests of infants in their respective courts.\n10. Guardianship by election, as mentioned by some of the English writers, has never been recognized in this country. Hargrave, in his note 16 to Co. Litt. 88b. says: \u201cThe right of making such an election arises only when, from a defect of the law, the infant finds himself wholly unprovided with a guardian.\u201d\nLord Coke, in Co. Litt. 87b. saj-s: \u201cIf a man be seized of a rent-charge, rent-seek, common of pasture, and such like inheritances which do not lie in tenure, and dieth,\u2014 his heir within the age of fourteen years,\u2014 in this case the heir may choose his guardian; but if he be of such tender years as he can make no choice, then (if the father hath made no disposition of the custody of the child,) it were most fit that the next of kin, to whom the inheritance cannot descend, should have the custody of him. And who-sover taketh the rent, &c., the heir shall charge him in an account. But if he hold any land in socage, in that case the guardian in socage shall take into his custody as well the rent-charge, &e., as the land holden in socage, because he hath the custody of the heir.\u201d This is a ease in which Lord Coke supposes that the heir may choose his guardian before the age of fourteen. Mr. Har-grave remarks upon it, that \u201cLord Coke only takes notice of such an election where the infant is under fourteen; and, as to this, omits to state how, and before whom, it should be made. Nor have we yet met with any prior or cotemporary writer who supplies the defect. As to a guardian after fourteen, it appears, from the ending of guardianship in socage at that age, as if the common law deemed a guardian afterwards unnecessary. However, since 12 Car. II., enabling a father to appoint a guardian to his children till twenty-one, it has been usual, for want of such a guardian, to allow the infant to elect one for himself.\u201d \u201cSuch election is said to be frequently made before a judge on the circuit. 2 Ves. Sr. 375. But we do ndt think this form to be essential. The last Lord Baltimore, when he was turned of eighteen, having no testamentary guardian, and being under the necessity of having one for some special purposes, relative to his proprietary government of Maryland, named a guardian by deed.\u201d \u201cIndeed, it seems as if there was no prescribed form of an infant\u2019s electing a guardian after fourteen, any more than there is before; and therefore election by parol might, perhaps, be sufficient, though it would be wrong to trust to a mode so unsolemn. But we do not wonder at the deficiency, because guardianship by election of the infant is of very late origin; it being, we believe, not only unnoticed by any writer before Lord Coke, except Swinburne, but there still being no cases in print to explain the powers incident to it, or whether an infant may change a guardian so constituted by himself. Even Lord Coke, we see, though professing to enumerate the different sorts of guardianship, and though he had before mentioned the latter one, omits it here.\u201d Co. Litt. 8Sb. \u201cWhence it may probably be conjectured that, in his time, it was, in'- strictness, scarcely recognized as legal.\u201d\nWhat Swinburne says in part 3, \u00a7 11, respecting the right of the infant to choose his tutor, applies only to the custom of the province of York. Buck v. Draper, 3 Atk. 631. Thus we see that the right of infants, at the age of fourteen, to choose their guardians, is not .universal, nor has been \u201cof a thousand years\u2019 standing.\u201d By the law of Maryland (Act 1715, c. 39, \u00a7 7). \u201cIf any part thereof (that is, of the intestate\u2019s estate) belong to an orphan who is capable of choosing his guardian, such orphan shall be called to court (the county court) and shall then and there choose his guardian, into whose hands the said orphan\u2019s estate shall be committed; but if such orphan be not at age, then the justices aforesaid (of the county court) shall put the persons, lands, goods, and chattels of the orphans into the hands of such person or persons as they shall think fit, and take a bond, with two sufficient sureties, in the names of che orphans themselves, for the securing and delivering the said estate to said orphans, or their guardians, when thereunto lawfully called.\u201d The persons thus appointed, before the orphan is of age to choose his guardian, are, by the act, called trustees. It is not expressly said in the act how long these trustees shall exercise the rights of guardianship; but, from their being bound to deliver up the property to the orphans themselves, it is evident that the guardianship was to continue, or might continue, until the orphans should be of full age, and capable of receiving the possession of their estates; and by the provision being in the alternative, namely, to deliver up the estates to the orphans, or to their guardians, it is equally evident that guardians might be afterwards appointed; but as the county court had power, upon the trustees\u2019 refusal to give new security when required, \u201cto remove the orphan\u2019s estates out of their hands\u201d (Act 1715, c. 39, \u00a7 20), \u201cand to remove the person and estate of such orphan into other hands\u201d (Act 1729, c. 24, \u00a7 6), it does not necessarily follow that the trustees so appointed were to be removed of course, upon the infant\u2019s attaining the age of fourteen; nor that the infant, after such appointment, had a right, at the age of fourteen, to choose his guardian; for the obligation of the trustees to deliver up the estate to the guardian, when required, might be only an obligation to deliver it to the person into whose hands the court should order it to be removed, in the cases referred to in the 20th section of Act 1715, c. 39, and 6th section of Act 1729, c. 24.\nThis idea is corroborated by the 33d section of Act 1715, c. 39, by which, if a guardian should commit waste, and should fail to give security as the court should require, to answer to the orphan for the waste, when at age, the orphan (if at age to choose his guardian,) should elect his guardian; but if not of age to' make such election, the court should appoint such other person as they should think meet; and the guardian so elected, and the other person so appointed, were to hold and enjoy the land and plantations until the orphan should \u201ccome to age.\u201d By this section, the persons appointed by the court while the orphan was under fourteen years of age, were required to hold the estate granted, until the full age of the infant; therefore, taking together the 7th, 20th, and 33d sections of Act 1715, with the 6th section of Act 1729, and Act 1763, c. 24, it seems to us that the right of the infant to elect a guardian, which is clearly recognized by those acts, is confined to the case where the infant is without a guardian or trustee already appointed by the court, or by the father, under the statutes of 4 & 5 Phil. & M. c. 8, or 12 Car. II. c. 24. By Act 1703, c. 24, the court was authorized, on application, to permit an orphan of fourteen years of age to choose his guardian; and if under fourteen, the court was to appoint the guardian, even before the distributive share of the orphan was certified by the commissary to the county court; and the guardian so appointed was to have the same power as a guardian otherwise axipointed, viz. to hold the estate until the full age of the orphan. The act of Maryland of 1777 (chapter 8), by which the orphans\u2019 court was erected, gives to that court all the powers before vested in the eounty courts, or in the commissary general, in relation to guardians and testamentary affairs. Thus the law stood until the legislature revised the several acts upon the subject, and adopted the system reported by the chancellor of Maryland in Act 179S, c. 101.\nIn the previous acts nothing was said of guardians by nature, or natural guardians, or testamentary guardians, except that the latter are excluded from the operation of the 30th section of the act of 1715, which requires the guardian to ascertain the annual value of the real estate, &c., the words are \u201cother (orphans) than such whom the testator in his lifetime, by his last will or testament, hath otherwise ordered and disposed of.\u201d But those acts only provided for the case of orphan infants; that is, fatherless infants. The legislature seems to have supposed that the father, as guardian by nature, had the custody and care of the real and personal estate, as well as of the person of his child; and does not seem to have considered the mother of an orphan as his guardian by nature, after the death of the father. This was not so at the common-law. By that law the guardian by nature, had only the custody of the person of his heir apparent; and, after the death of the-father, the mother, if living, was guardian by nature to her heir apparent. The grandfather was also guardian by nature to his grandson, if he was his heir apparent. So the grandmother, the uncle, the aunt, &c., would, each, be guardian by nature to his or her heir apparent; and yet the old acts of Maryland, in all such cases, authorized the county courts to appoint guardians, although there were already, by the common law, guardians by nature whose authority over the person of the infant, continued until he arrived at the age of twenty-one years.\nThose acts, and especially the act of 1715, having provided for a guardian in every case, except the case of an infant whose father was living, ought to be construed as having virtually declared that the father, as guardian by nature, should have the custody and \u25a0 care of the real and personal estate of the infant, as well as of his person. But the acts did not give the courts authority to require surety from the father, as natural guardian, unless that authority were given by the 20th section of the act of 1715, which enacts, \u201cthat the justices of the county courts take able and sufficient security for orphans\u2019 estates, and inquire yearly of the security; and if there be just cause, that they require new and better security; and upon refusal to give new and better security, that they remove the orphans\u2019 estates out of their hands.\u201d This section was not deemed sufficiently explicit to enable the county court to demand security from guardians, chosen by infants of fourteen years; and to remedy this defect, an act was passed in 1752 (chapter 3), expressly for the purpose of enabling the court to require se-. curity from such guardians; but that act did not apply to guardians by nature. If the 20th section of the act of 1715, did not, by its general terms, include guardians chosen by infants, it could not include natural guardians nor testamentary guardians. Indeed, if testamentary guardians had not been expressly recognized in the 30th section of the act of 1715, it would be difficult to maintain that the general words, in which the 7th section gives the power of appointment to the county court, would not be justly construed as repealing the statutes of 4 & 5 Phil. & M. c. 8, and 12 Car. II. c. 24, so far as they might have been supposed to operate in Maryland. But it is believed that those statutes have always been considered as in force in Maryland, so far as to authorize a father to appoint, by his will, a guardian for his infant children.\nAgain, the 7th section of Act 1715, c. 39, by giving power to the court to appoint a guardian for every orphan who is entitled to a distributive share, superseded, in all such cases, the common-law right of guardianship by nature, except in the case of the father; so that neither the mother, nor the grandfather, nor the uncle, could, in such cases, be guardians by nature, in Maryland. Prom whence it follows, that after the statute of descents (Act 1786, c. 45), and before 1798, in Maryland, there were only three kinds of guardians, viz.: (1) Testamentary guardians under the statute of 4 & 5 Phil. & M. c. 8, and 12 Car. n. c. 24; (2) natural guardians; (3) statutory guardian, viz. guardian appointed by the county court under the statute of 1715, and by the orphans\u2019 court under the statute of 1777 (chapter 8). Por although the orphan, at the age of fourteen, had a right to choose a guardian, the appointment was still to be made by the court; and although the persons appointed by the court, when the orphan was under the age of fourteen, were called trustees, yet they were, in fact, guardians, and had all the rights, and were subject to all the duties of guardians; they are, indeed, sometimes called guardians in the same act of 1715. The infant, if no guardian had been appointed for him, and if his father were not alive, when he arrived at the age of fourteen, had a right to choose his guardian in court; but if a testamentary guardian had been appointed, or if the court had appointed a guardian for him before his age of fourteen, or if his father were living, he had no right to choose his guardian. If this be the true construction of the law of Maryland previous to 1798, the provisions of the act of that year (chapter 101) will be perfectly intelligible.\nThe act of 1798 (chapters 101, 12) does not, like the act of 1715, confine the power of the court to the case of orphans entitled to a distributive share of an intestate personal estate, but extends it to all infants to whom lands shall descend, or.be devised, or who may be entitled to a legacy, or to a distributive share of the personal estate of an intestate, if the infant have no natural or testamentar}\u2019 guardian. By \u201cnatural guardian,\u201d in this statute, must be intended such a natural guardian as is entitled to the guardianship of the estate, as well as of the person of the infant. At common law, there was no such natural guardian; the guardian by nature, under that law, being only entitled to the custody of the person of his heir apparent. The previous law of Maryland, recognized only one natural guardian entitled to the guardianship of the estate of the infant; and that was the father. If, then, the infant have no father, nor testamentary guardian, the orphans\u2019 court has the right of appointing the guardian. The act of 1798, does not, in any manner, recognize the right of the infant to choose his guardian at any age. On the contrary, the orphans\u2019 court is authorized, in all cases in which it may appoint a guardian, to make the appointment until the full age of the infant. This power is directly repugnant to those parts of the former acts of Maryland, which authorize the infant to choose his guardian, and consequently repeals them. Guardianship in socage, and guardianship for nurture, which were the only two eases in which the infant had, by the common law, a right to choose his guardian, seem to have been virtually abolished by Act 17C5, c. 39, which gave the power to the county courts to appoint guardians to all orphans entitled to a distributive share. The right of election, which they afterwards had, depended upon the statutes which were repealed by that of 1798 (chapter 101). The case of an orphan who has acquired property by deed of gift, or by purchase other than devise, is not provided for by that statute. There is no court competent to appoint a guardian for him, nor do we think he can constitute one by his own act Indeed, we think he has not, in any case, a right to choose his guardian. And it was not without reason, that the legislature thought proper to transfer the right of election from the infant to the orphans\u2019 court. At the age of fourteen, the infant begins to be restless and ungovernable, and the salu tary restraints of the guardian are irksome. The infant is apt to think his guardian penurious and tyrannical. He wants greater indulgences; and there are always artful and insinuating men enough, who are eager to grasp all the property they can lay hold of; and who, taking advantage of these dispositions in the infant, will stimulate his restlessness, excite his suspicions, undermine the authority of the guardian, and finally prevail on the infant, in his simplicity, to place his property in their hands. The chance of evil resulting from the infant\u2019s right of election, seems greater than the chance of good; and the choice of the court is more likely to be, judicious than that of the infant. \/\nAn appeal to the supreme court of the United States was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the matter in dispute not being of the value of $1000. 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 243.\nThe third error assigned, is that the infant was not brought into court to choose his guardian. This appears to us also to be a fatal error; especially as the infant was not out of the jurisdiction of the court at the time. In the case of Loyd v. Carew, in 1699, 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 200, pl. 2, it is said, that \u201cif a person, appointed a guardian pursuant to the statute (12 Car. II. c. 24), dies, or refuses to take upon himself the guardianship, my lord chancellor may appoint a guardian; but a guardian cannot otherwise be appointed, than by bringing the infant into court, or his praying a commission to have a guardian assigned him.\u201d 2 Fonbl. Bankr. Cas. bk. 2, pt. 2, c: 2, \u00a7 2, p. 236. In an anonymous ease, in the upper bench, in 1655: \u201cThe court was moved in behalf of an infant to discharge a guardian assigned by the court, with an intent to make Richard Somers, attorney of this \u2022court, guardian in his room, and that the former inspection may be discharged, and that the infant may now be inspected again, because when the former inspection was, and the guardian assigned, there was no action depending in court against the infant. Glyn, C. J. Let it be so, for the cause you have alleged, and give notice of it to the former guardian.\u201d Style, 456. 1 Newl. Ch. Prac. 105. If the infant reside within twenty miles of London, the guardian is appointed by the court, for which purpose the infant, and the person intended to be appointed guardian, personally attend in court. If the infant reside above twenty miles from London, the guardian is appointed by commission, and the infant must be personally before the commissioners. 14 Ves. 172; 2 Newl. Ch. Prac. 151; 1 Har. Ch. Prac. 711, 712; 2 Mad. Ch. Prac. 279 The Maryland act of 1715 (chapter 39, \u00a7 7), which allowed an infant of the age of fourteen to choose his guardian, required the infant to be called to court, and then and there to choose his guardian; and Act 1798, ec. 101, 12, \u00a7 2, says, \u201cThe said court shall have power to call, or have brought before them, any orphan as aforesaid, for the purpose of appointing a guardian.\u201d If, as we have supposed, the only right which the infant had, in Maryland, to choose his guardian, be given by the statute, it paust be exercised in the manner prescribed by the statute. We think, therefore, that if the infant had a right to choose his guardian, it could only be done personally, and in open court, and not having been so done, the election and appointment were void.\nThe fourth error assigned is, that the petitioners were not cited to show cause why they should not be removed. That the petitioners, who were the actual guardians, and who had a right to continue such until the full age of j their ward, unless lawfully removed, should have had notice of his application, and an opportunity to show cause against it, \/^eems to have been a course dictated by a v common sense of justice. They had a power coupled with an interest, which they had a right, and perhaps, were bound to defend. But, as we think the orphan had no - right to elect a guardian, and if he had, he could not exercise it out of court, we think the want of notice is a fatal error. The fifth \u25a0 error assigned is in substance only a repetition of the fourth.\nUpon the whole, we are of opinion, that the orphans\u2019 court, having' appointed Mr. Forrest and Mr. Mauro guardians of the infant until his age of twenty-one years, had no jurisdiction or authority to appoint Mr. Ritchie, and that his appointment is not merely voidable, but absolutely void; that Mr. Forrest and Mr. Mauro have never ceased to be guardians; and are now \u25a0 entitled to all the rights and powers of guardians; and that the sentence of the orphans\u2019 court, dismissing the bill of review, be reversed, with costs; and that this court, proceeding to pass such sentence, as the orphans\u2019 court ought to hare passed upon the hearing of the bill of review, should order and decree that the order of the orphans\u2019 court, appointing John T. Ritchie guardian to the infant John W. Ott be reversed, with costs,\n2\nSee the judge's opinion in the National In-telligencer of the 25th December, 1826."},{"case_name":"Peter Mc\u2019Cartee, one of the executors of the last will and testament of Philip Jacobs, deceased, appellant, against The Orphan Asylum Society of the City of New-York, respondents","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2159612\/","date":"1827-12-01","court":"New York Court of Errors","content":"Woodworth, J.\nThe will of the testator declares, that if he left any child alive at the time of his death, the executors should receive the rents and profits for the benefit of s\u00fcch child, until it should attain the age of 21 years or marry.\nThe next clause devises the rest and residue of the real and personal estate to the respondents, to take effect immediately after debts and legacies are paid, if the testator should leave \u00f1o child; and if he should leave a child, then upon the death, marriage, or attaining of 21 years of age of such child.\nFrom this statement, it is evident that had there been no child, the devise was direct to the respondents; and in that event, it was undoubtedly intended they should take immediately. But there was a child; and consequently no \u00e9s tate passed to the respondents at the death of the testator. The latter part of the preceding clause is to be taken in connection with that giving the rents and profits, to the child if any was left, inasmuch as the executors were to apply the rents and profits, until marriage or 21 years of age. The testator suspended the vesting of the estate in the respondents until the happening of e.ither of those events. Upon the contingency taking place, the devise is direct to the respondents.\nThus far the intent is plainbut it will be observed that the will had not yet declared in whom the legal estate should be vested from and after the.death of the testator, until the death, marriage, or lawful age of the child that might be left. As the executors were to receive the rents and profits if the contingency contemplated should happen, it was advisable to give them the legal estate during the continuance of this trust; and accordingly we find that the next clause in the will makes such a provision. It devises to the executors all the real estate subject to the trust aforesaid. This manifestly refers to such trusts as the executors were to perform. What are they 1 No other trusts were imposed on them, excepting that they should apply the rents and profits for the benefit of the child, in the manner the testator had designated. , *They did not hold the real estate in trust for the respondents, to be conveyed to them on the happening of a certain event, for this (to my mind) conclusive reason ; there was no necessity that they should hold for the respondents, because the testator had declared.that, on a certain contingency, the estate should go to the respondents. That event has happened ; and, therefore, by force of the will, (if they are capable of taking,) they took the legal estate directly. They needed not the aid of trustees to pass this estate to them. I consider their title as accruing independent of any act or thing to be done by the tras tees.\nThen follows a further direction, which is somewhat at variance with the disposition made before. The testator proceeds to declare that when the child shall attain 21 years, or marry, his real estate should be sold by the executors, and one half of the proceeds to be paid to such child. Now upon the established principle of collecting the intent from the whole will taken together, and reconciling discordant parts with each other, the question arises, what is the effect of this clause ? In the first place, I think it must be conceded that it clothes the executors with an additional trust. In a certain event they are to sell, and pay half the proceeds to the child. How is this clause to operate upon the preceding devise, which declares that on the death, marriage, or attainment of 21 years by the child, the respondents are to take all the real and personal estate ? They cannot stand together. I think the effect of the last clause is, to qualify and diminish the quantum of interest which had before been given to the respondents, provided the child married, or attained 21 years. Instead of the whole, which the words of the preceding ,part give, the testator has, in the conclusion, declared that his child shall receive half. This, then, operates as a diminution of the respondent\u2019s interest pro tanto. It also changes the manner of conferring on them the testator\u2019s bounty. Under the first clause, the estate, such as it was, would pass to them. Under the latter, they are restricted to one half; and as the executors were to sell the estate, had the contingency happened, then and in that case their claim would be for half of the money, not-half of the land. Upon the *supposition that the child had lived to 21 or married, I admit that the legal estate would have remained in the executors, until they had performed the trusts before specified ; and had they refused to pay one half of the proceeds of the sale, the respondents would be entitled to relief. Such are my views as to the construction of this will. If they are correct, then it follows that, as the testator left a child, the estate did not vest in the respondents at his death ; but it vested in the executors subject to the trusts I have mentioned; and such estate so vested in the executors, ceased on the death of the child. The objects for which it was created then ceased. There were no rents or profits to receive for the benefit of the child, nor could there be a sale of the estate. The death of the child was an event which deprived the executors of all further power or control over the real estate, and vested it in the respondents. If so, the estate was devised to them directly.\nIf the construction given is not erroneous it is a conceded point that the devise is void by reason of the exception in the statute of wills, unless the authority to purchase, given by the act incorporating respondents, includes the right to take by devise ; which forms the remaining point in this cause.\nIt is a well settled rule, that where there is a discrepancy or disagreement between two statutes, such exposition should be made as that both may stand together. In the present case, there is no express authority in the act of incorporation to take by devise ; but it is contended that the term purchase includes devise, as well as an actual purchase for valuable consideration. If it be admitted that such is the legal import of the term, it appears to me that does not decide the question. The inquiry is, ought the term to be construed in its most comprehensive sense, when, by so doing, the effect is to repeal the express words of a prior statute ? or in a more limited sense, according to the popular acceptation; thus leaving the former act unimpaired ?\nIt is laid down in 19 Vin. Abr, 525, pl, 132, that repeals by implication are things disfavored by the law, and never allowed of but where inconsistency and repugnancy are plain *and unavoidable; \u201cfor these repeals carry along with them a tacit reflection upon the legislators, that they should ignorantly, and without knowing it, make one act repugnant to and inconsistent with another; and such repeals have been ever interpreted so as to repeal as little of the preceding law as possible.\u201d\nIt is also a rule of law, that all acts in pari materia, are to be taken together as if they were one law. The statute of wills prohibits a devise to a corporation; the act incorporating the Orphan Asylum Society declares that they may - Purchase \u25a0 real estate. \u00a1In the-most extensive.signification ^e- word, purchase,- it \u2022 includes. a devise, and therefore relates to the subj ect which hy' the- statute of wills-, is excepted. These statutes, I apprehend-, ought to be construed - together; and-in as much as the right claimed is,-, by the'for mer statute, expressly denied, it' would-seem to .be.more congenial-to the spirit- of both -acts, to 'understand the word purchase- in a restricted sense, and as so intended by.the legislature. The-consequence of-such a construction is, that the statute of wills has full operation, and- the term purchase is confined to-such- other- modes-of'-acquiring real estate as do not--include- a devise. The legislature- may- be - considered as-granting to'this corporation the right to purchase-subject-to other existing- statutes, and not-as conferring a-right to purchase without restraint. It. cannot\u2019be that such a clause was intended to overleap positive restrictions found in other statutes. On this principle, I do not perceive why the- statute of.frauds, or that against maintenance, may not be passed over as in effect repealed,-so far as the right claimed by this corporation is concerned. -And yet it will not be pretended that the term purchase is to be carried to that extent. If not,- what are -the grounds -upon which-the restriction rests? Manifestly these : You may purchase and hold real estate it is true ; but in making the acquisition, it must be remembered that the laws of- the \u2022 state have declared certain requisites\" essentially necessary to perfects title; and in certain cases have denied.the right altogether. Whatever-*can be purchased consistently with 1 these laws, is granted; what can not is denied.\n-Again; the right topurehase is-incident to-a corporation, an^ would exist if the statute had not conferred the -right, But I presume it will not be contended that this incidental right, had the act of incorporation been silent, would have authorised the corporation to take by devise. Why .then should the term purchase, when used in the act, have a more extensive signification than it -would -have\u2019 as incidental to the power of the corporation? It-seems-to me that, in both cases the meaning of the term is the same. The act conferred no additional power in this respect. The princi pal object of this clause was, to limit the amount of property the corporation was authorised to hold.\nThat the right to purchase in a corporation does not include the right to take by devise, appears to have been the opinion of the supreme court in the case of Jackson v. Hammond, (2 Cain. Cas. in Err. 337.) The opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice-Benson. The construction of the act of April 6th, 1784, enabling, churches to incorporate themselves, was under consideration. The act declares that the trustees appointed under it shall have good right and lawful authority to take, acquire and purchase lands, tenements and hereditaments. The expressions are as ample as in the act incorporating the Orphan Asylum Society. It is manifest, however, the court did not consider those words as conferring a right to take by devise. It was contended, that by the statute of the 6th of April, 1784, enabling churches to incorporate themselves, they are constructively, (with respect to lands possessed or held by them at the time of their incorporation,) made capable of taking by devise. The court held that the term devise in that act referred to goods and chattels, not to lands and tenements. And it may here be observed, that whether that construction was well founded or not, the term devise there used had reference only to such property as the church or congregation may have held before, and at the time of incorporation. As to future acquisitions, *the 5th section of the act regulates them in the terms I have already stated. Under that clause it was considered that a power to take by devise was not granted. It was not, it is true, the direct question before the court; but the view taken is nevertheless entitled to respect, and is of considerable weight in deciding the construction of similar words in a subsequent statute. From the scope of the opinion, I infer that the learned judge entertained no doubt on this point. He observes, \u201c the only manner in which, had they been incorporated, they were capable of taking, being by gift or grant, and not by deviseand again, when speaking of the construction contended for, that the word devise applied to lands which the church held before incorporation, he fur ther observes, \u201c if this' construction is to obtain, then this consequence will follow: that the legislature must be supposed to have intended to give to a church\" a capacity to hold lands' as it were before their incorporation, and refuse to them a capacity to take, and consequently to hold lands acquired after their incorporation ; and without a reason for the discrimination.\" It was therefore considered that, after incorporation, the corporate body could not take by devise.\nI have thus very briefly given my views as to the construction of this statute ; and arrived at a conclusion that the exception in the statute- of wills is not affected by the grant of powers to the Orphan Asylum Society.\nIt is unnecessary for me to discuss the\" various- other questions which have been examined by his honor the chancellor ; as my opinion upon the whole case rests on this ground; that, on the death of the child, the estate was devised directly to the respondents ; that after that event, there were no trusts remaining for the executors to execute, those imposed upon them by the testator having ceased; and that the devise being void by the statute of wills, the decree in the court below should be reversed.\nSutherland, J. concurred.\n* Savage,\" Ch. J. being related to the appellant, gave no opinion.\nAllen, Dayan, Elsworth, Hager, Hart, Lake, McCarty, McMartin, Waterman and Wilkeson, Senators, concurred.\nCrary, Senator. (After stating the facts.) The respondents claim the whole residuary estate of the testator, The claim to the real estate is resisted, on the ground that the respondents, being a corporation, are disabled by the exception in the statute concerning wills to take by devise\nBy this act, it is provided, that any person having any estate in lands, may at his own free will and pleasure, give and devise the same to any person or persons, (except bodies politic andcorporate,) by his last will and testament.\nThis exception is found m \u201c an act to reduce the laws concerning wills into one statute,\u201d passed 3d of March, 1787. (See 1 Greenleaf's ed. L. 387.) At that period the people of this state could not have been jealous of col\u00f3rate bodies, for very few existed. We must then look for the reason of this exception to some other cause; and as we find it in the statute of Henry 8th, it is most likely it was adopted, upon the authority of the parliament of Great Britain; and no question having arisen upon it in this state, the exception has been continued in the subsequent revisions of the laws.\nIf the right to dispose of real estate by will is created by statute, then the legislature may qualify the right; but if it existed before the statute, then the legislature by affirming it in one part, cannot restrain the exercise of it in another.\nSir William Blackstone says, (2 Com. 373,) \u201cit seems sufficiently clear, that before the Conquest, lands were devisable by will. But upon the introduction of the military tenures, the restraint of devising lands naturally took place, as a branch of the feudal doctrine of non-alienation without the consent of the lord.\u201d\nPaley, in his Philosophy, (ch. 13,) says, \u201c since the Conquest, lands in this country could not be devised by will, till within, little more than two hundred years ago, when this *privilege was restored to the subject, by an act of parliament in the latter end of the reign of Henry the Eighth.\u201d\nRobertson, in his history of Charles the Fifth, (1 Vol. note 8 of proofs and illustrations,) says, \u201c the victorious troops divided the conquered lands. Whatever portion of them fell to a soldier, he seized as the recompense due to his valor, as a settlement acquired by his own sword. He took possession of it as a freeman in full property. He enjoyed it during his own life, and could dispose of it at pleasure, or transmit it as an inheritance to his children. Thus property in land became fixed. It was at the same time allodial, that is, the possessor had the entire' right oi property and dominion.\u201d\nThese references clearly show the right to dispos\u00e9 of real estate, hy will in England, previous to the statute of Henry the Eighth. And it is worthy of remark, that while this right continued, the tenure by which lands were held in England was allodial ; the precise tenure hy1 which they are held here,\nThus, it would seem that the devise of the real estate for the benefit of the respondents, is not void from the testator\u2019s incapacity to make it;' but valid at common law. 1\nThe next qiiestioti is, as to the ability of the respondents to take and hold real estate. That is settled by the act incorporating them, (30th sess\/ p. 508\/\u00a7 l,)\u2018tiy which\" it is enacted that \u201c The Orphan Asylum Society in\u2019the city of New York, by that iiam\u00e9 shall he capable inlaw of\" purchasing, holding and conveying, any estate, real or personal\/ for the use of the said' corporation: Provided, such estate shall not exceed in valu\u00e9\" \u00f3\u00f1\u00e9 hundred t\u00edi&ii\u00e9and dollars.\u201d\nThe value of the estate belonging to the\" respondents no where \u00e1ppears, and it is not to be presumed that it exceeds the amount allowed to be held by their charter.\n*This act of incorporation appears to have been passed on the 7th of April\/1807 ; and may be referred to for another purpose : It is the sense of the legislature, after1 the experience, under the\" statute concerning wills for twenty years, that the policy of the exception in that statute was wrong\", at least so far as it respected the Orphan Asylum hi the city of New York, and it1 may be questionable whether the exception is riot thus far abrogated.\nIt was assumed in argument, that if the testator was not disabled by the exception, from devising to the Orphan Asylum, it was not in the power of the legislature to prevent devises to any corporate body, ahd to any extent; but it was not pretended that the legislature might not repeal the exception.'\nThe Orphan Asylum have the capacity to take and hold real estate to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ; and are not disabled to take by devise. On what principle then can it be said they shall not take ?\nSuppose the statute had provided, that the Orphan'Asylum might take by devis\u00e9; can it b\u00e9 pretended that a' devise in that case would not be valid?\nIf the statute had enacted that the Orphan Asylum nriight take by devis\u00e9, it would have be\u00e9n a limitation upon the right t\u00f3 take generally; and might possibly b\u00e9 considered as excluding the right to take in any other way for the right, to take and hold generally includes all the Ways and means by which prop\u00e9rty can- be acquired.\nWhich of these statutes then shall we give effect t\u00f3 ? It is a familiar principle, that a new statute repeals an old one, if inconsistent with' it. In the present case, the statute concerning wills prohibits a devise to a corporate bodyand twenty years afterwards the legislature incorporate The Orphan Asylum Society in the city of New York ; and declare the society, by that name, capable in law of purchasing, holding and conveying any estate,- &c. I need- not mention that title by purchase includes that by devise.\nThus it will be s\u00e9\u00e9n that both statutes'may stand together and that is desirable, Whether inadvertently \u00f3r advisedlypassed.\n*But there is another view of the subject, which would induce me to be in favor of affirming the decision of the chancellor.\nAll tenures of land granted by the p\u00e9ople of this state, &c., shall be and remain allodial and not feodal. (1 Rv L. 71.)\nThis act was passed before the act concerning wills.\n1 Allodium, as defined by Blackstone, is the land possessed by a man in his own right, without owing any rent or service to any superior. (2 Bl. Com. 104.)\nThe absolute rights of each individual are the right of personal security, the right of personal liberty, and the right of private property. (3 Bl. Com. 119.)'\nIt is the last, that of private property, which has been invaded by the exception in the statute concerning wills.\nAnd I now advert again to the argument, that if the devise in question is not within the exception in the act concerning wills, it is not in the power of the legislature to restrain devises to corporate bodies. And I ask why it should be ?\nThe very definition of municipal law limits the power of the legislature to commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong.\nIf the legislature can restrain us as it respects our charitable donations, they may also compel us to make them; for whatever is a subject of legislation may be commanded as well as prohibited.\nAnd if the legislature can declare a devise to the Orphan Asylum invalid, they may, upon the same principle, make us pay tithes of all we possess.\nThis is a free representative government; and one of the prominent features by which it is distinguished from a despotic one is, the preservation and protection of individual right; for it can make no difference with the citizen what the form of government is that oppresses him, and deprives him of his right; whether it consists of one tyrant or one hundred and sixty, if his suffering and deprivation are the same.\n*It is difficult to conceive on what principle men elected, by the people for public purposes, can limit and restrain individuals in the exercise of their legitimate rights.\n\u25a0 If individuals give up any part of their rights by becoming members of society, it is that they may obtain protection for' such as remain ; and on the same principle that allegiance is demanded by the government, protection is claimed by the citizen; and if not granted, the original compact is broken.\nIf courts of justice have occasion to advert to first principles the object should be the protection of individual right and not to confirm legislative usurpation. And in a government founded on principle, it is the duty of the judiciary department to decide in favor of individual right, when it is required to be done, on fundamental principles, though it should be to declare invalid an act of the legislature. The contest which ended in the separation of these United States from Great Britain, was a contest for individual right, intended to be secured by the Constitution of the United States. But of what avail is it, that no law shall be passed impairing the obligation of a contract, or that private property shall not be taken for public use, without a just compensation, if the paramount right to dispose of our property by will is denied us ?\nIn a government founded on principle, the application of it is the only limitation of power. The judiciary, although the weakest, is the most independent branch of the government, and the only branch that can, by the force of principle, limit and restrain the exercise of power. Can it then admit of a doubt, that it is the duty of the judiciary so to apply principle as to prevent any encroachment by the legislature upon individual right ?\nAlthough I have taken a view of the subject somewhat different from the chancellor, I am however satisfied with the different views which he has taken. Yet I think his decree ought to be so modified as to allow the appellant his costs; inasmuch as he has acted under the advice of counsel, and I see nothing reprehensible in his conduct.\n*Stebbins, Senator. The merits of this case do not appear to me to lie beneath the mass of learning which has been displayed in the investigation of the case.\nAs I view it, the inquiries whether a devise of lands to a corporation directly, is void or not under the statute of wills, and if void, whether such a devise can be sustained in equity in virtue of the genera, powers and jurisdiction of the court of chancery in cases of trust, do not become material.\nThe questions presented by the case, as I view it, are first, whether the testator (Philip Jacobs) devised the real estate in question to the corporation directly,, or to his executors, subject to the trusts- mentioned in the will; second, whether the devise to trustees for the use of the respondents, is a- valid devise, under which they can take as cestuis que use; and third, whether the use is executed by the statute of uses, and-if so, the effect.\nTo carry into effect the intention of the testator, is a cardinal rule in the construction of wills ; and to do so, it is necessary to give effect to every part of the instrument, if possible.\nThe testator devises all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate real and personal, (which includes the premises in question,) to The Orphan Asylum Society, to be applied to the charitable purposes, for which the association was established; to take effect immediately after the payment of debts and legacies, if he should leave no child; but if he should leave a child, then to take effect upon the death, intermarriage, or attaining of age of such child.\nThis, it is contended, is a direct devise to the respondents of the real estate in question ; and, standing alone, it would undoubtedly be susceptible of no other construction ; but he proceeds to devise all his real estate to his. executors, subject to the trust aforesaidand declares his will to be,- that whenever such child should attain the age of twenty-one years, or marry, his real estate should be sold by his executors, and one half the proceeds paid to such child.-\nThe testator had a posthumous child, which died at about the age of two years. Had that child lived and attained to the age of twenty-one years, no doubt can be entertained of *the intention of the testator, that it should then be entitled to a moiety of the proceeds of the real estate, which was to be sold by the executors. But such a provision is in hostility to the previous devise to the respondents, to take effect upon the coming of age of the child. Upon the hap pening of that event by the first clause,,the.estate was to vest in the corporation, and by the subsequent, one,.to be -sold by the executors, and one half the proceeds paid to the child. If, therefore, the-'first devise is to be carried :into effect according to its terms, the latter provision is entirely without effect.\nTo give effect to every part of the will, it seems to have been the obvious intention of the testator, if he should leave a child, to devise the real ,estate to, his executors in trust for the society, if such child should die under age and unmarried; if not, then upon the .maturity or marriage of the child, to be sold, and the proceeds divided between the society and such child.\nThe executors, then, took the estate at the death of the testator, subject to these trusts; - and the question arises whether, at the death of the child under age and unmarried, the real estate was, by the terms of the mil, to vest in the corporation.\nIt has been- said upon the argument, that if the executors took the estate as trustees, they can only be divested of that ' trust by their own grant, or by operation of the statute of uses; but: I can perceive-no objection (provided the terms of the will require it,) to their holding the estate in trust, until the happening of an event such as the death of this child; and then that the fee should vest in other persons, by way of executory devise. Was it then the intention of the testator, upon the happening of this contingency, that the fee should vest in the corporation, or continue in the trustees for their benefit 1 The latter appears to me to be the fair construction of:the-will.\nIn one paragraph he devises, after payment of debts and legacies, \u201call the rest, residue, and-remainder of his estate real and personal, to the respondents, to take effect upon the death of this child; and in the next he devises his real estate to his executors, subject to the,trust aforesaid. It was a *use, therefore, or beneficial interest, which I suppose be intended to devise to the respondents, leaving the fee in the hands of the .trustees.\nIf, as I have endeavored to show, it was r.ot the intention of the testator to d\u00e9vise the estate dir\u00e9ctly to the respon\u00bb * bents upon the coming of age ox his child, it is a strong argument to prove that such was not his intention in c\u00e1se of the death of such child; for both contingencies are coupled in the same paragraph, and there is no limitation to the trust created in either case,\nThe next and more important question is, whether the x ... corporation can take the use under this will, notwithstanding the provisions of our statute of wills. This statute enacts that any person having any estate of inheritance in any lands, tenements or hereditaments, may give or devise the sam\u00e9, or any rent or profit out of the same, to any person or persons, (except bodies politic and corporate,) by his last will and testament, or by any other act by him lawfully executed; and it is contended, that if a devise to a corporation directly would be void, a devise of the us\u00e9 is also void.\nAlthough in England; under the Saxons, lands were deviable by will at common law, yet at the Conquest, and upon the introduction\"of the feudal system,'the common law underwent \u00e1 complete change in this respect; and an estate in fee simple in lands was no longer devisable. It became inconsistent with the nature of that system, that a tenant should have an unlimited power t\u00f3 devise his lands ; for' the reason that he might devis\u00e9 to persons incapable of performing- feudal services. The power of alienation by devise, (except of a chattel interest,) is in England, then, to be traced to the statutes of wills of the 32 Hen. 8, ch. 1, and 34 Hen. 8, ch. 5.\nOur statute of wills is a transcript of these, with the additional enumeration of rents and profits. It is contended that\" the terms rents and profits mentioned in the statute, are intended to describe a use, and that as the lands cannot, so the use also cannot, be devised to a corporation under this\" statute.\n*1 apprehend, however, there is a material difference between rents and profits, and that which has long been known under the denomination of a use.\nRents and profits are incorporeal hereditaments ; but a use is not. A use is said to be neither jus in re nor ad rem, neither right, title nor interest in law, but a species of property unknown to the common law, and owing its existence to the equitable jurisdiction of chancery, resting upon confidence in the person and privity of estate : a thing collateral to the land, and only annexed to a particular estate in it, not to the mere possession; so that when the estate to which the use is annexed is destroyed, the use itself is destroyed, as by disseisin, or the entry of tenant by the curtesy or in dower. It was rather a hold upon the conscience of the feoffee to uses, than a lien upon, or interest in the land; and the principle upon which it was founded was, that the feoffee was bound in conscience to follow the direction of the feoffor. (See Cruis. Dig. tit. 11, ch. 2.) A thing so subtle, and cognizable only in courts of equity, which act upon the conscience, differs essentially from an incorporeal hereditament, which is of legal cognizance. Indeed, incorporeal hereditaments, such as rents, advowsons, &c., were the subject of conveyance to uses.\nIf, then, a use is not comprehended in the terms of the statute, the argument rests upon the ground that if a devise of land to the corporation would have been invalid, the demise of the use is equally so.\nIt might perhaps be conceded, that if corporations were prohibited by statute from taking the fee by devise, (which by the by, is not the case,) the law would not allow them to take the use. But the history of the English law furnishes at least a plausible argument against such a proposition.\nCorporations were prohibited by several statutes of mortmain from holding lands ; yet it was deemed necessary to enact the statute of 15 Rich. 2, ch. 5, declaring uses subject to the statutes of mortmain. (Chudleigh\u2019s case, 1 Rep. 120.)\nBut the statute of wills is an enabling statute, and not prohibitory. Before this statute, individuals had no capacity *to devise lands ; but this enabled them to do so, except to corporations. In conferring the capacity to devise, the legislature withheld the capacity to devise to a corporation ; and for what reason ?\nBefore the statute of wills, corporations were prohibited by the mortmain acts from taking or holding lands, or uses \u25a0 arising from them. The exception therefore, in the statute of-wills, could not-have been introduced for the purpose of prohibiting, corporations from taking by .devise, for .they were already prohibited from taking in any mode ; but was to guard- against enabling them to take by devise. Without the exception in the statute of .wills in - England they .would have been enabled to take by devise, when the mortmain acts would have prohibited their taking .in any othei ,way.\nThe history of the statute, I think, fortifies this view . of it. In the first statute of wills, (32 Hen.: 8, ,ch. 1,) corporations were not excepted, and were therefore enabled to take by devise in common with other persons, contrary to the policy of the statutes of mortmain; but two years after-wards the parliament, finding the mortmain acts- so- far epealed by the statute of wills, passed a new statute, (34 Hen. 8, ch. 5,) not prohibiting corporations m terms from taking under the statute of wills, but entitled, \u201c an act for the explanation of the statute of wills,\u201d in which they -re-enact the provisions of the first statute of,wills, and introduce the exception as to corporations ; not, therefore, expressly prohibiting corporations from taking, but qualifying the capacity to devise. The intention seems to have been to rely upon the mortmain laws, to keep property from corporations and to qualify the statute of wills so as not to interfere with those prohibitory acts.\nThe distinction is a wide one between an incapacity to devise and a prohibition against taking; for although there may be an incapacity to devise directly to a corporation,' yet such incapacity will not prevent the corporation from taking by. grant from the devisee in trust, if there is no prohibition against their taking. So, too, there be an incapa city to devise lands to a corporation, and yet the corporation may-*take a use. But in either case, if prohibited from taking, the law would not probably allow that to be indirectly done which was directly prohibited.\nIf, then, there is no other reason arising from the, statute of wills why corporations may not take land by devise, except the want of capacity in the devisor to convey, there Would seem to be no objection in this case against the corporation\u2019s taking as cestui que use; for a devisor has capacity to devise a use; and this corporation is not prohibited from taking and holding either land itself or a use. All the English mortmain acts, including the 15th Rich. 2, are repealed by our statutes.\nAnd if corporations cannot take by devise, merely for want of capacity to take in that particular way, the cases of a conveyance from a wife to her husband through the intervention of a trustee, and of a tenant in tail to a purchaser by means of a common recovery, seem to be conclusive to show that an indirect mode of conveyance is no fraud upon the law when resorted to only to remedy a want of capacity to convey directly.\nBut it is contended, that inasmuch as our legislature saw fit to repeal the English mortmain acts, including the statute of 9 Geo. 2, ch. 36, which prohibited all charitable bequests unless made and enrolled one year previous to the death of the donor, the policy of retaining the exception in the statute of wills, was to prevent impositions upon persons in extremis who might easily be persuaded to dispose of property to ecclesiastical incorporations for charitable uses, after it should no longer be of use to themselves.\nSuch an object, however, would not seem to comport with the policy of the legislature, who neither saw fit to prohibit corporations from holding lands, nor to impose the restraints of the statute of 9 Geo. 2.\nIf the policy was to prevent impositions, why was not the exception in the statute aimed at devises for religious or charitable purposes, instead of devises to corporations gen-rally ? There surely is no danger of persons making improvident devises to monied or manufacturing corporations.\n*The English statutes, which the legislature were reenacting, furnished every variety of prohibition against improvident devises, much better calculated to effect the object than any general prohibition of devises to corporations. They guarded against improvident devises, whether io individuals or corporations, for religious, superstitious or charitable uses.\nIf it is shown that the exception in the statute of wills is to be regarded not as a prohibition against the taking oi lands by a corporation, but as a qualification of the capacity to devise, created by that statute, the opinion pro nounced in the court of chancery in this cause, contains another view of the subject which appears to my mind perfectly conclusive. It is, that before the statute of wills, when persons were not capacitated to take lands by devise, they might nevertheless take the use in that way; and, therefore, that since the statute of wills, although corporations cannot take lands by devise, yet they may take the use, there being no prohibition.\nCorporations, 'since the statute of wills, stand in the same situation as to taking lands by devise, as all natural persons stood in before that statute. If, therefore, a use was devisable before the statute, a corporation may take a use by devise since the statute, especially if it be such as is not executed by the statute of uses.\nIt is said by Cruise that uses were devisable, though lands were not; and persons, by that means, acquired a disposition of property for the benefit of their families, which they had not otherwise. They were the invention of ecclesiastics to evade the statutes of mortmain. And after the 15th Rich. 2, ch. 5, which subjected them to the statutes of mortmain, the practice of conveying to uses was continued, as the most effectual mode of evading the hardships of the feudal tenures, and of securing estates from forfeiture for treason. They became general, and were applied to purposes inconsistent with the policy of the government. Feoffments were made secretly; so that persons who had to sue, found it difficult to ascertain the right tenant against whom to bring their pracipe. Widows were deprived of their dower, husbands of their curtesy, purchasers and creditors were defrauded, the * king and other lords lost their profits, fines, &c., and obscurity and confusion of titles prevailed.\nDuring the long and bitter contest between the houses of York and Lancaster, most of the lands in England are said to have been conveyed to uses. As these evils came t'O-be felt, the parliament attempted, from time to time, to apply a remedy. By the 50th Ed. 3, feoffments to the use of the feoffor were made liable to execution creditors; by the 1st Rich. 3, ch. 1, all conveyances by cestui que use Were made valid; by the 1st Hen. 7, ch. 1, a formedon Was given against cestui que use; by the 4th Hen. 7, ch. 17, lords were entitled to wardship of the cestui que use; by the 19th Hen. 7> ch. 15, further relief Was extended to creditors ; by the 23d Hen. 8, superstitious uses were suppressed; and, finally, by the statute of uses, 27 Hen. 8, ch. 10, after reciting all these mischiefs, the legislature declared that possession shall be annexed to the use.\nThe object of the crown was to re-assert its rights of Wardship, and other feudal profits out of the lands of the nobility; and the intention of parliament was to abolish Uses by changing them into legal estates, and subjecting them to the rules of common law tenures.\nThe construction of this act, however, in a great measure defeated the intention of the legislature. Transferring the possession to the use by this statute gave rise to a mode of conveyance, by this means, which, on account of its convenience, by dispensing with the ceremony of livery, Soon came into general use; so that uses, instead of being suppressed, were resorted to as the common and most simple mode of conveyance. And it being determined that all uses were not executed by that statute, its operation was circumscribed; and a large class of uses were left untouched, and have continued to this day under the denomination of trusts, constituting one of the principal branches of equity jurisdiction.\nIt Was said by Lord Hardwicke, (1 Atk. 591,) that this statute, made upon great consideration, introduced in a solemn and pompous manner, by its strict construction has had no other effect than to add at most three words to a conveyance.\n*Before the statute of uses, we have seen they were devisable to natural persons, although there was then no statute of wills nor any common law capacity to devise.\nThe operation of the statute upon uses, js said to hart been by turning the use into land, to render it not devisable in the same manner as the land itself. (2 Black. Com. 375.) This is the language of the elementary writers ; and during ]the short period of time between the statute of uses and the subsequent statute of wills, (a period of only five years,) I have not been able to fipd \u00bfany case, and few, if any, could have arisen, going to sustain, impeach, or explain the proposition.\nIf it is meant that during this period a cestui que use, under a feoffment or other conveyance, was, by force .of the statute of uses, to be regarded as the owner of the land so far as to incapacitate him to devise such use, he having no capacity to devise land, I perceive no objection to the proposition.\nBut to render the doctrine applicable to this case, it must go farther, and be held to mean that a use created by will is converted into land by the statute, and therefore was not devisable.\nOne of the things necessary to the execution of a use by the statute is \u201c a use in esseand it seems to be difficult to conceive how the statute can operate upon a use until it shall be raised, and in existence ; and if a use was raised in this case, it can only be in virtue of a capacity to devise such an interest. There being, then, a capacity to devise the use, the .operation of the statute upon it, if it is such a use as could be executed by the statute, it appears to me could be no other than by annexing the possession to the use, to vest the estate in the devisee, who would take, not as devisee, but under the statute of uses. And there would seem to be no objection to the execution of the use in this case, if the position is correct that the corporation are not prohibited from taking, whatever may be the objection as to the capacity of the testator to devise to it directly; foi it has been held in the case of a feoffment by the husband to A, for the use of his wife, that such a use *is executed by the statute, notwithstanding the husband had no capacity to convey .directly to his wife. .(Cruis. Dig. tit. 11, ch. 3, s. 28.)\nBtit all the' reasoning arising from the statute of Uses, is answered, if the use in this case is such as- could Hot- be executed by that statute'; for clearly, in such case,- it could have no' operation to destroy the capacity to devise'.\nThe question then arises, whether the use'in this c\u00e1\u00e9e is within the statute'; and the' examination of it necessarily casts us back Upon the will, id seek for the intention\u2019 of the testator. He devises the estate to trustees, in trust for the Orphan Asylumt Society, to be applied to the charitable purposes for which th\u00e9 association was established. His object was not to benefit the society; but through it, to apply the estate to the charitable purposes for which the society was organized. The society itself is a trustee; and has- a trust to perform,- which a court of equity Would undoubtedly enforce. It is a devise to trustees for the' use of the society, as trustees for certain charitable pttrposes.\nSuppose the corporation to be- dissolved by the expiration of its charter ;\u25a0 it hever could have been the intention of the testator that these funds should be diverted from the charitable purposes to which he devoted them ;J and a court of equity he\u2019v\u00e9f Would permit it. If the corporation should, by dissolution or otherwise, become incompetent to execute the trust, I see. nothing to' distinguish the case from that of the ordinary one of a failure of th'\u00e9' \u00edr\u00fcste\u00e9, in which the court Would act by the appointment of another.\nAgain, suppose the' powers of the corporation to be enlarged by a statute authorizing it to' do banking or insurance business, in addition to the charitable operations for which it was first incorporated; will it be contended that it was the intention of the testator; that these funds should be used, or that the\" laW Would permit them to be used in such banking or insurance operations, instead of being applied to the charitable purposes designated in the will ? I apprehend not.\nIf it is granted, then, that the corporation itself had a trust to execute under this will, it is a case not within the statute of uses ; for that statute can only execute the first use, which, *in this case, would vest the estate in the cor poration, unincumbered by any trust for charitable purposes, and contrary to the plain intention of the testator.\nA trust is a use not executed by the statute; and the author of the Touchstone remarks, (p. 507, n. (1),) that \u201c one of the modes of creating a trust, is said to be where lands are limited to the use of A. in trust to permit B. to receive the rents and profits ; for the statute can only execute the first use.\nThe conclusions which follow my view of the case are, that the devise of the real estate in question, was not to the corporation directly, but to the executors for the use of the corporation upon the contingency which has happened, to be appropriated to certain charitable purposes :\nThat under the statute of wills, there is a mere incapacity in corporations to take lands by devise, and not a prohibition against their taking:\nThat a use was devisable at common law before the statute of wills; and therefore that this corporation may take a use by devise, not being prohibited by statute from taking either a use or the land itself:\nThat the use in this case is not such as could be executed by the statute of uses; or if it is, that the operation of the statute would not invalidate the devise, but vest the estate in the corporation.\nIf these propositions are established, it follows that the respondents are entitled to the estate in question; and that the decree of the court of chancery is, at least, substantially correct.\nBurrows, Gardiner, Haight McCall and Smith, senators, concurred, that the decree should be affirmed.\nDecree of reversal as to the real estate\n[1]\nBowen v.

And I do hereby declare it to be my will and intention, that the said rest, residue and remainder of my said real and personal estate, should be at all events applied for the uses and purposes above set forth,and that it is my desire all courts of law and equity will so construe this my sard will as to have the said estate appropriated to the above uses, and that the same should in no. case, for want of legal, form or otherwise, be so construed as that my relations, or any other persons, should heir, possess or enjoy my .property, except in the manner, and for the uses herein above specified.\u201d\nThe legislature of the state of .New York, within a few years after the death of the testator, on the application of the trustees, who are also named as executors in the will, passed a law, constituting the persons holding the offices designated in the will, and their successors in office, a body corporate, by the name and style of \u201c the Trustees of the Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbour in the city of New York,\u201d anddeclaring that they and their successors, by the name and , style aforesaid, shall be capable in law of holding and disposing of the said real and personal estate, devised and bequeathed as aforesaid, according to the intentions of the aforesaid will. And that the same is hereby declared to be vested in them and their successors in office for the .purposes therein expressed.\nIf, after such a plain and unequivocal declaration of the testator with respect to the disposition, of his property, so cautiously guarding against, and providing for every supposed difficulty that might arise, any technical objection shall now be interposed to defeat his purpose, it will form an exception to what we find so universally laid down in all our books, as a cardinal rule in the construction of wills, that the intention of the testator is to be sought after and carried into effect. But no such difficulty in my judgment is here presented. If the intention of the testator cannot be Parried into effect, precisely in-the mode at first contemplated by him, consistently with the rules of law, he has provided an alternatiye, which, with the aid of the act of the legislature, must remove all difficulty.\nThe case of the Baptist Association vs. Hart\u2019s executors, 4 Wheat. 27, is supposed to have a strong bearing upon the present. This is however distinguishable in many important particulars from that. The bequest there was, \u201c to the Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia.\u201d This association not being incorporated, was considered incapable of taking the trust as a society. It whs a devise in present\u00ed, to take effect immediately on the death of the testator, and the individuals composing it were numerous and uncertain, and there was no executory bequest over, to the association if it should become incorporated. The court therefore considered the bequest gone for uncertainty as to the devisees, and the property vested in the next of kin, or was disposed of by some other provision in the will. If the testator in that case had bequeathed the property to the Baptist Association on' its becoming thereafter, and within a reasonable time incorporated, could there be a doubt but .that 'the subsequent incorporation would have conferred on the association the capacity of taking and managing the fund.\nIn the case, now before the eourt, there is no uncertainty with respect to the individuals who were to execute the trust. The designation of the trustees by their official character, is equivalent to naming them by their proper names. Each office referred to was filled by a single individual, and the naming of them by their official distinction was a mere designado personas. They are appointed executors by the same description,and no objection could lie to their qualifying and acting as such. The trust was not to be executed by them in their official characters, but in their private and individual capacities. But admitting that if the devise in the present case had been to the officers named in the will and their successors, to execute the trust, and no other contingent provision made, it would fall within the case of the Baptist Association vs. Hart\u2019s executors.\nThe subsequent provisions in the will must remove all difficulty on this ground. If the first mode pointed out by the testator for carrying into execution his will and inten tion, with respect to this fund, cannot legally take effect, it must be rejected, and the will stand as if it had never been inserted ; and the devise would then be to a corporation, to be created by the legislature, composed of the several officers designated in the will as trustees, to take the estate and. execute the trust.\nAnd what objection can there be to this as a valid executory devise, which is such a disposition of lands, that thereby no estate vests at the death of the devisor, but only on some future contingency 1 By an executory devise, a freehold may be made to commence in futuro, and needs no particular estates to support it. The future estate is to arise upon some specified contingency, and the fee simple is left to-'descend to the heir at law until such contingency happens. A common case put in the books to illustrate the rule is : if one devises land to a feme sole and her heirs upon her marriage. This would be a freehold commencing in futuro, without any particular estate to support it, and would be void in a deed, though good by executory devise, 2 Black. Com. 175. This contingency must happen within a reasonable time, and the utmost length of time the law air. lows for this is, that of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards. The devise in this case does not purport to be a present devise to a corporation not in being, but a devise to take effect in futuro upon the corporation being created. The contingency was not too remote. The incorporation was to be procured, according to the directions in \u2022the will, as soon as possible, on .its being ascertained that the trust- could not legally be carried into effect in the mode first designated by the testator. It is a devise to take effect upon condition that the legislature should pass a law incorporating the trustees named in the will. Every executory devise is upon some condition or contingency, and takes effecConly upon the happening of such contingency or the performance of such condition. As in the case put of a devise to a feme sole upon her marriage. The devise depends on the condition of her afterwards marrying.\nThe doctrine sanctioned by the court in Porter\u2019s case, 1 Coke\u2019s Rep. 24, admits the validity of a devise to a future in corporation. In answer to the argument that the devise of a charitable use was void under the statute 23 Hen. 8, it was said, that admitting this, yet the condition was not void in that case. For the testator devised that his wife shall have his lands and tenements, upon condition that she, by the advice of learned counsel, in convenient time after his death, shall assure all his lands and tenements for the maintenance and continuance of the said free school, and alms men and alms women for ever. So that although the said uses were prohibited by the statute, yet. the testator hath devised, that counsel learned'should advise, how the said lands and tenements should be assured, for the uses aforesaid, and that may be advised lawfully: viz. To make a corporation of them by the king\u2019s letters patent, and afterwards, by license, to assure the lands and tenements to them. So if a man devise that his executors shall, by the advice of learred counsel, convey his lands to any corporation, spiritual or temporal, this is not against any act of parliament, because it may lawfully be done by license, &c. and so doubtless\u2019was the intent of the testator, for he would have the lands assured for the maintenance of the free school, and poor, for ever, which cannot be done without'incorporation and license, as aforesaid; so the condition is not against law: quod fuit concessum per curiam.\nThe devise in that case could det take effect without the incorporation. This was the condition upon which its validity dep\u00e9nded. And the incorporation was to be procured after th.e death of the testator. The devise then, as also in the case now before the court, does not purport to be a present devise, but to take effect upon some future event. And this distinguishes the present case from that of the Baptist Association vs. Hart\u2019s executors, in another important circumstance. There it was a present devise, here it is a future devise. A devise to the first son of A. he having no son at that time, is void; because it is by way of a present devise, and the devisee is not in esse. But a devise to the first son of A. when he shall have one, is good; for that is only a future devise, and valid as an executory devise. 1 Salk. 226, 229.\nThe'cases in the books are very strong to show,'that for the purpose of carrying into effect.the intention of the tes tat\u00f3r, any mode pointed out by him will be sanctioned, if consistent with the rules of law, although some may fail. In Thellusson vs. Woodford, 4 Ves. Jun. 325, Buller, Justice, sitting with the lord chancellor, refers to, and adopts with approbation, the rule laid down by lord Talbot in Hopkins vs. Hopkins: that in such cases, (on wills,) the method of the courts is not to set aside the intent because it cannot take effect so fully as the testator desired, but to let it work as far as it can. Most executory devises, he says, are without any freehold to support them; the number of contingencies is not material, if they are to happen within the limits allowed by law. That it was never held that executory devises are to be governed by the rules of law, as to common law conveyances. The only question is, whether the.contingencies are to happen within a reasonable time or not. The master of the rolls in that case says, (p. 329,) he knows of only one general rule of construction, equally for courts of equity and courts of law, applicable to willsi The intention of the testator is to be sought for, and the will carried- into effect, provided it can be done consistent with thq rules of law. And he adds another rule, which has become an established rule of construction. That if the court can see a general intention, consistent with the rules of law, but the testator has attempted- to carry it into effect in a way that is not permitted, the court is to give effect to the general intention, though the particular mode shall fail. 1 Peere Wms, 332. 2 Brown\u2019s Ch. 51.\nThe language of Lord Mansfield in the case of Chapman vs. Brown, 3 Burr. 1634, is very strong to show how far courts will\u2019 go to carry into effect the intention of the testator. To attain the intent, he says, words of limitation shall operate as words of purchase; implication shall supply verbal omissions. The letter shall give way, every inaccuracy of-grammar, every impropriety of terms, shall be corrected by the general meaning, if that be clear and manifest.\nIn Bartlet vs. King, 12 Mass. Rep. 543, the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts adopt the rule laid down in Thellusson vs. Woodford, that the court is bound to carry the will into effect if. they can see a general intention con sistent with the rules of law, even if the particular mode or manner pointed out by the testator is illegal. And the court refer with approbation to what is laid down by Powell in his Treatise on Devises, 421', that a devise is never construed .absolutely void for uncertainty, but from necessity: if it be possible to reduce it to certainty it is good. . So also in Finlay vs. Riddle, 3 Bihn. Rep. 162, in the supreme court of Pennsylvania,\"the rule is recognized, that the general intent must be carried into effect, even if it is at the expense of the particular intent.\nA rule so reasonable and just in itself, and in such perfect harmony with the whole doctrine of the law in relation to the construction of wills, cannot but receive the approbation and sanction of all courts of justice; and a stronger case calling for the application of that rule can scarcely be imagined than the one now before the court. The general intent of the testator, that this fund should be applied to the maintenance and support of aged, decrepid and worn out sailors, cannot be mistaken. And he seems to have anticipated that some difficulty might arise, about its being legally done in the particular mode pointed out by him. And to guard against a failure of his purpose on that account, he directs application to be. made to the legislature for an incorporation, to take and execute the trust according to his will; declaring his will and intention to be, that his estate should at all events be' applied to the uses and purposes aforesaid; and desiring all courts of law and equity.so to construe.his will, as to have his estate applied to such uses. And fo make it still more secure,' if possible, he finally directs that his will should in no case, for want of legal form or otherwise, be so construed, as that his relations, or any other persons, should heir, possess or enjoy his property, except in the manner and for the uses specified in his' will..\nThe will looks ther\u00e9fore to three alternatives:\n1. That the officers named in the will as trustees, should take th\u00e9 estate and execute the trust.\n2. If that could not ieg\u00edMy be done, then ha directs his* trustees to procure an act of incorporation, and vests the .estate in it fpr the purpose of executing the trust.\n3. If both these should fail, his heirs, or whosoever should possess and enjoy the property, are charged with the trust:'\n\u201e That this trust is fastened upon the land cannot admit of a doubt. Wherever a person by will gives property, and points put the object, the property, and the way in which it. shall go, \u00e1 trust is created; unless he shows clearly, that bis desire expressed is to be controlled by the trustee, and that he shall have an option to defeat it. 2 Ves. Jun. 335.\nIt has been urged by the demandant\u2019s counsel, that these lands cannot be charged with the trust in the hands of the heir, because the will directs that they, shall, not be possessed or enjoyed, except in the rhanner and for the uses specified. That the manner and the use must concur in order to charge the trust on the land. But I apprehend this is a mistaken application of the term manner,as here used. It does not refer to the persons who were to'execute the trust. But to the mode or manner in which it was to be carried into effect, viz. by erecting upon some eligible part of the land an asylum, or marine hospital, to be called the Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbour. And, the uses were, \u201cfor the purpose of maintaining and supporting aged, decrepid arid worn out. sailors.\u201d Whoever therefore takes the land, takes it charged with these uses or trusts, which are to be executed in the manner above mentioned. And if so,-there can be no objection to the act of incorporation, and the vesting the title therein declared. It does not interfere with any vested rights in the heir.. He- has no beneficial interest in the land. And the law only transfers the execution of the trust from him to the corporation, and thereby carrying into effect the clear and manifest intention of the testator. But being of opinion that the legal estate passed under the will, I have not deemed it necessary to pursue the question of trust, and have simply referred to it, as being embraced in the point submitted to this court.\nIf this is to be considered a devise to a corporation, it will not come within the prohibitions in the statute of wills, 1 Revised Laws, 3G4. For this act of incorporation is, pro tanto, a repeal of that statute.\nTaking this devise therefore in either of the points of view in whicn it has been considered, the answer to the question put must be, that it is valid, so as to divest the heir of his legal estate, or at all events, to affect the lands in his'hands with the trust'declared in the will.\nIf this view of the devise in the will of Robert Richard Randall be correct, it puts an end to the right and claim of the demandant, and might render'it unnecessary to examine the other points which have been certified to this court, had the questions come up on a. special verdict or bill of exceptions. But coming up on a certificate of a division of opinion, it has been the usual course of this court to express an opinion upon all the points..\nIt is not however deemed necessary to go into a very extended examination of the other questions, as the opinion of the court upon the one already considered, is conclusive against the right of recovery in this action.\nII. The second general question is, whether John Inglis, the demandant, was. or-was not capable of taking lands in the state of New York by descent.\nThis question is presented under several aspects, for the purpose, of meeting what at present from the evidence appears a little uncertain, as to the time of the birth of John Inglis. This question as here presented, does not call upon the court for an opinion upon the broad doctrine of allegiance and the right of expatriation, under a settled and unchanged state of society and government. But to decide what are the rights of the individuals composing that society, and living under the protection of tliat government, when a revolution occurs; a dismemberment takes place; new governments are formed; and new relations between the government and the people are esi\u00e1blished.\nIf John Inglis, according to tlfe first supposition under this point, was born before' the 4th of July' 1776, he is an alien; unless his remaining in New York during the war changed his character and made him an American citizen.' It is universally admitted, both in the English courts and in those of our own country, that all persons born within.the colonies of North America, whilst subject to the crown of Great Britain, were natural born British subjects, and it must necessarily follow, that that character was changed by the separation of the colonies from the parent state, and the acknowledgement Of their independence.\nThe rule as to the point of time at which the American unt\u00e9 nati ceased to be British subjects, differs in this country and in England, as established by the courts of justice in the respective countries. The English rule is to take the date of the treaty of peace in 1783. Our rule is to take the dat\u00e9 of the declaration of independence. And in the application of the rule to different cases, some difference in opinion may arise. The settled doctrine of this country is, that a person born here, who left the country before the declaration of independence, and never returned here, became thereby an alien, and incapable of taking lands subsequently by descent in this country. The right to inherit depends upon the existing state of allegiance at the time of descent cast. The descent cast in this case being long after the treaty of peace, the difficulty which has arisen in some cases, where ]he. title was acquired between the declaration of independence and the \u2022treaty, of peace, does not arise here-. Prima facie, and as a general rule; the character in which the American ante nati are to be considered, will depend upon, and be determined by the situation of the party and the \u00e9lection made at the date of the declaration of independence, according to our rule; or the treaty of peace according to the British rule. But this general rule must necessarily be controlled by special circumstances attending particular cases. ' And if the right of election is at all admitted, it must be determined, in most cases, by what took place during.the struggle, and between the declaration of independence and the treaty of peace. To say that the election must have been made before, or immediately at the declaration of independence, would render the right nugatory.\nThe doctrine of perpetual allegiance'is not applied by the British courts to the American ante nati. This is fully shown by the late case of Doe vs. Acklam, 2 Barn. & Cresw. 779. Chief Justice Abbott says, \u201c James Ludlow, the father of Frances May, the lessor of the plaintiff, was undoubtedly born a subject of Croat Britain. He was born in a cart of America which was at the time of his birth a British colony, and parcel of the dominions of the crown of Great Britain; but upon the fact found, we are of opinion that he was not a subject of the crown of Great Britain at the time of the birth of his daughter. She was born after the independence of the colonies was recognised by the crown of Great Britain, after the colonies had become United States, and their inhabitants generally citizens of those states. And her father by his continued residence in those states manifestly became a citizen of them.\u201d He considered the treaty of peace as a release, from their allegiance, of all British subjects who remained there. A declaration, says he, that a state shall be free, sovereign and independent, is a declaration, that the people composing the state shall no longer be considered as subjects of the sovereign by whom such a declaration is. made. And this court, in the case of Blight\u2019s Lessee vs. Rochester, 7 Wheat. 544, adopted the same rule with respect to the right of British subjects here. That although born before the revolution, they are equally incapable with those born subsequent to that event of inheriting or transmitting the inheritance of lands in this country. The British doctrine therefore is, that the American ante nati, by remaining in America after the treaty of peace, lost their character of British subjects. And our doctrine is, that by withdrawing from this country, and adhering to the British government they lost, or, perhaps more properly speaking, never acquired the character of American citizens.\nThis right of election must necessarily exist, in all revolutions like ours, and is. so well established by adjudged cases, that it is entirely unnecessary to enter into an examination of the authorities. The only difficulty that can arise is, to determine the time when the election should have been made. Vattel, B. 1, ch. 3, sec. 33. 1 Dall. 58. 2 Dall. 234. 20 Johns. 332. 2 Mass. 179, 236, 244, note. 2 Pickering, 394. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 49.\nI am not aware of anylcase in the American courts where this right of election has been denied, except that of Ainsley vs. Martin, 9 Mass; 454. Chief Justice Parsons does there seem to recognise, and apply the doctrine of perpetual alie giance, in its fullest extent. He then declares that a person born in Massachusetts, and who, before the 4th of July 1776, withdrew into the British dominions, and never since returned into the United States, was not an alien, that his allegiance to the king'of Great-Britain was founded on his birth, within his dominions, and that that allegiance accrued to the commonwealth of Massachusetts, as his lawful successor. But he adds what may take the present case even out of his rule: \u201c It not being'alleged,\u201d says he, \u201c that the demandant has been expatriated, by virtue of any statute or a.ny judgment of law.\u201d But the doctrine. laid down in this cas\u00e9is certainly not that which prevailed in the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, both before and since that decision, as will appear by the cases above referred to of Gardner vs Ward, and Kilham vs. Ward, 2 Mass, and of George Phipps, 2 Pickering, 394, note.\nJohn Inglis, if born before the declaration of independence, must have been very young at that time, and incapable ofniaking.an election for himself; but he must, after such a lapse of time, be taken to have adopted and ratified the choice made for him by his father, and still to retain the character of a British subject, and never Ip have become an American citizen, if his father was so to be considered. He was taken 'from this country by his father before the treaty of peace, and has continued ever since to reside within the. British dominions without signifying any dissent to the election made for him; and this ratification, as to all his rights, must relate back, and have the' same effect and operation, as ifvthe election had been made by himself at that time.\nHow then is his father Charles' Inglis to be considered \u201c? Was he an American citizen ? He was here at the tipie of the declaration of independence, and prima facie may be deemed to have become thereby an American citizen. But this prima facie presumption may be' rebutted; otherwise there is no force or meaning in the right of election. It surely cannot be said, that nothing short of actually removing from the country before the declaration of independence will be received as evidence of the election ; and every act -thatuould:be~dope to signify the choice that had been made, except actually withdrawing from the country, was done by Charles Inglis. He resided in the city of New.York at the declaration of independence, and remained there'until he removed to England, a short time before the evacu\u00e1tion of the city by the British in November 1783; New York during the whole of that time, except from July to September 1776, being in possession, and under the government and control of the British, he taking a. part'and acting with the British ; and was, according to the strong language of the witness, as much a royalist as he himself was, and that no man could be more so. Was Charles Inglis under these circumstances to be considered an American citizen? If.being here at the declaration of independence necessarily made him such, under all possible circumstances he was an American citizen. But I apprehend this would be carrying the\u2019rule to ap extent that never can be sanctioned in a court of justice, and would certainly be going beyond any case as yet decided.\nThe facts disclosed in this case, then, lead irresistibly to the conclusion that it was the fixed determination of Charles Inglis the father, at the declaration of independence, to adhere to his native allegiance. And John Inglis the son must be deemed to have followed the condition of his father, and the character of a British subject attached to and-fastened on him also, which he has never attempted to throw off by any act disaffirming the choice made for him by his father.\nThe case of M\u2019Ilvaine vs. Coxe\u2019s Lessee, 4 Cranch, 211, which has been relied upon, will not reach this case. The court in .that case recognized fully the right of election, but considered that Mr Coxe had lost that right by remaining in the state of New Jersey, not only after she had declared herself a sovereign state, but after she had passed laws by which she pronounced him to be a member of, and in allegiance to the new government; that by the act of the 4th of. October 1776 he became a member of the new society, entitled to the protection of its government. H\u00e9 continued to reside in New Jersey after the passage of this law, and until some time in the year 1777, thereby making his election to become a member of the new government; and. the doctrine of aller giaiiee became applicable to his case, which rests on the ground of a mutual compact between the government and the citizen or subject, which it is said cannot -be dissolved by either party without the concurrence of the .other. It is the tie which binds the governed to their gpvernment, in return for the protection which the government affoj-ds them. New Jersey, in October 1776, was in a condition to extend that protection, which Coxe tacitly accepted by remaining there. But that was not the situation of the city of New York; it was in the possession of the British. The government of the state of New York did not extend to it in point of fact.\nThe resolutions of the convention of New York of the 16th of July 1776, have been relied upon as asserting a claim to the allegiance of all. persons residing within the state. But it may well be doubted whether these resolutions reached the case of Charles Inglis. The language is, \u201c that all persons. abiding- within the state of New York, and deriving protection from the laws of the same, owe. allegiance to the said laws, and are members of the state.\u201d Charles Inglis was. not, within the reasonable interpretation of this resolution, abiding in the - state and owing protection to the laws of the same. He was \u2019ithin the British lines, and und\u00e9r the protection of the British army, manifesting a full determination'to continue a British subject. But if it should be ad-' mitted that the state of New York had a right to claim the allegiance of Charles Inglis, and did assert that eight by the resolution, referred to, still the case of M\u2019ilvaine vs. Coxe does not.apply.\nIt cannot, I-presume, be denied, but that allegiance may be dissolved by the- mutual consent of the government and its citizens or subjects.. The government may release the governed from their allegiance. This is even the British doctrine in .the case of Doe vs. Acklam, before referred to. The act of attainder passed by the legislature of the state of New Y^rk, by which Charles Inglis.is declared to be for ever, banished from the state, and adjudged guilty of treason if ever afterwards,he should be-found there,-must he considered a release of his allegi\u00e1n\u00e9e, if ever he owed any to the-state. 1 Greenleaf's Ed. L. N. Y. 26.\nFrom the view of the general question referred to in this court, the answers to the specific inquiries will, in my judgment, be as follows.\n1. If the demandant was bom before the 4th of July 1776, he was born a British subject; and no subsequent act on his part, or on the part of the state of, New York, has occurred to change that ch\u00e1racter; he of course continued an alien, and disabled from taking the land in question by inheritance.\n2. If born after the. 4th of July 1776, and before the 15th of September of the same year, when the British took possession of New York, his infancy incapacitated him from making any election for himself, and his election and character followed that of his father, subject to the right of disaffirmance in a r\u00e9asonable time after the termination of his minority; which never having been done, he remains a British subject, and disabled from inheriting the land in question.\n3. If born after the British took possession of New York, and before the evacuation on the 25th of November 1783, he was, under the circumstances .stated in the case, born a British subject, under the protection of the British government, and not under that of the state of- New York, and of course owing no allegiance to the state of New York. And even if the resolutions of the convention of the 16th of July 1776 should be considered as asserting a rightful claim to the allegiance of the demandant and his father, this claim was revoked by the act of 1779, and would be deemed a release and discharge of such allegiance, on the part of the state, and which Saving been impliedly assented to, by the demandant, by withdrawing with his father 'from the state of New York to the British dominions, and remaining there ever since, worked a voluntary dissolution, by the assent of the government and the demandant, of whatever allegiance antecedently existed, and the demandant at the time of the descent cast was an alien, and incapable of taking lands in New Fork by inheritance.\n4t When, Charles Inglis, the father, and John Inglis, his son, withdrew from New York to the British dominions, they had the right of electing to become and remain British subjects. And if the grand assize shall find, that in pointof fact they had made such election, then the demandant at the time of the descent cast was an alien, and could not inherit real estate in New York.\nIII.. The next question is, whether the will of Catherine Brewer-ton was sufficient to pass her right-and interest in the premises in question, so as to defeat the demandant in any respect; the premises being at the dat\u00e9 of the will, and ever since, held adversely by the tenants in the suit.\nMrs Brewerton-was the sister of Robert Richard Randall, and if the devise in his will is void and cannot take effect, she, as one of his heirs at law, would be entitled to a moiety of th\u00e9 lands in question. She died in the year 1815, having shortly before made her last will and testament, duly'exeeuted and attested to pass -real estatq. By this will she devised and bequeathed all her real and personal estate, whatso\u00e9v\u00e9r and wheresoever, in law and equity, in. possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy (except some specific legacies) untp-. her executors, - upon certain trusts therein mentioned. If this will was therefore operative, so as to pass her right to her brother\u2019s estate,, it will defeat the demandant\u2019s right to recover, asfo one moiety of the premises in question.\nThe objection taken to the operation of this, will is,, that the premises were at the date thereof,, and ever since\u2019have been held adversely by the tenants in. the suit.-\nTh\u00e9 validity of this objection must depend upon the construction of the statute of wills in the state of New York. By that statute (1 N. Y. Rev. Laws, 364, sec. 1.) it- is declared,- that , any person having any estate of inheritance, either in severalty, in coparcenary, or in common, in any lands, tenements\u2019, or hereditaments, may.at his own free will and pleasure, give or devise the same, or any of them; or any rent or profit out of the same or out of any part thereof, to.any person pr persons, (except bodies public and corporate) by his last will and testament, or any other act by him lawfully executed.\nThis'being a question depending upon- the construction of. a state statute, .with respect to the title to real property, it has been the uijiform course of this court, to apply the same rule that we find applied by the. state tribunals in like cases. 1 Peters, 371. This statute upon the point now under consideration has received a construction by the supreme court of the state pf New York, in the case of Jackson vs. Varick, 7 Cowen, 238. The question arose tipon the validity of a devise in the will of Medcef Eden, the younger. The objection was, that .at the time of the devise, and of the death of the testator, the premises in question were., and had been for several years before in the adverse possession of the defendant, and that he and those under whom he claimed entered originally, without the consent- of the devisor or any one from whom he claimed. The court say, the facts present the question whether the owner in fee can devise land, which, at the time of the devise and his death, is in the adverse possession of another. That is, whether a person having a right of entry in fee simple, shall be said to have an estate of inheritance in lands, tenements or hereditaments in the language of Pur statute of wills.\nIt is unnecessary to pursue the course of reasoning which conducted the. court -to the. conclusi\u00f3n to which it came. The result of the opinion was,, that under the comprehensive words used in the act, a right of entry, as well as an estate in the actual seisin and possession of the devisor, was devi's\u00e1ble; and that an estate that would descend to the heir is transmissible equally by will. The judge who delivered the opini\u00f3n adverted to some cases that had arisen in the same court\u2018, wherein a\u2019contrary doctrine would seem to have been recognized, but-came to the conclusion, that no decision had been made upon the point.\nIn the case of. Wilkes vs. Lion, 2 Cowen, 355, decided in the court \u00f3f errors, in New, York; one of the points relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, was, that this same will of Medcef Eden, the younger, was .inoperative as to the premises then in question; they being lands of which he was not seised at the time.of his death. I do not find that any direct opinion was given upon this point; but the objection must have been overruled, or the court could not have pome to.th\u00e9 conclusion it did. .\nJt is said, however, by the demandant\u2019s counsel} that these cases do not apply to the or\u00ed\u00e9 now before the court ; but' only such estate as. would descend to the heir of the devisor, and that the premises in question here would not descend to the heirs of Mrs Brewerton for want of actual seisin. According to the rule laid down in Watkins on Descents, 23,-that where the ancestor tak\u00e9s by purchase, he may be capable of transmitting-the property so taken to his own heirs; without any actual possession in himself; but if the ancestor himself takes by descent, it is absolutely necessary, in, order to make him the stock or terminus, frorn; whom the descent should how run, and so enable him to transmit such fieredit\u00e1ments to his own heirs, that he acquire an actual seisin of such as are corporeal, or what is equivalent thereto, in such as are incorporeal.\nIt is very evident, however,'that the court could not have intended to apply this rule to the construction of the statute of wills- For they say, in terms, that the question is, whether a person having a right of entry in lands has an estate of inheritance devisable, according to the provisions of the statute. But under the common law rule referred to, a personhaving only \u00e1 right of entry, would not be accounted an ancestor from whom the inheritance would be.derived. 2 Black. Com. 209. Such a construction would be in n greki measure defeating' the whole operation of the act.\nThe demandant in this case states in his count, that upon the death of Robert R. Randall, the right to the land descended to -Paul R. Randall and Catherine Brewerton,in moieties. So that, by his own showing, she had a right of entry, which, according to the express terms of the decisions in Jackson and Varick, was devisable.\nThe answer to this question must accordingly be, ihat the Will of Catherine Brewerton was sufficient to pass her right and interest in the premises in question, notwithstanding .the adverse possession held by the tenants in this suit, at the date of the will.\nIV. The fourth point stated is, whether the proceedings against Paul.Richard Randall, as an absent debtor, passed bis right or interest in the lands .in question to,' and vested the .same in, the trustees appointed under the said proceedings, or either of them, so as to defeat the demandant in any-respect.\nPaul R. Randall, as stated in the case, died some time in the year 1820. He and his sister Mrs Brewertdn were the heirs at\"law to the. estate of their brother Robert Richard. Randall. If therefore the will of Mrs Brewerton operated to pass her right, .Paul R. Randall would be entitled to the other moiety. If her will did not operate, then he would be entitled to the whole of his brother\u2019s estate.\nIt does not appear from the case that any objections were made .to the regularity\u00a9! the proceedings against Paul R. Randall, under the absconding debtor act; and indeed the question, as stated for the opinion of this court, necessarily implies that no such objection existed. The question is, whether his'ri'ight in the land passed to, and became vested in the trustees.\nAs this, is the construction of a state law, this court will be govern\u00e9d very much by the decisions of the state tribunals, in relation to it. The question is, whether a right of entry passes under the. provisions of the absconding, debtor act of the state of New York, 1 Rev. Laws, 157. By the first section of the act, the. warrant issued to the sheriff commands him to attach, and safely keep, all the estate, retd and personal,, of the debtor. The tenth section authorises the trustees to take into their hands all the estate of the debtor,, whether attached as aforesaid or afterwards discovered by them; and that the said trustees, from their appointment, shall be.deemed vested with all the estate of- sacjh debtor, and shall be capable to gue for and recover the same. Arid the- trustees' are required to sell \u00bf11 the estate, real and personal, of the debtor, as shall come to their hands, and execute deeds and bills of sale, which shall be as valid as if made by the debtor himself.\nThese are. the only parts of the act which have, a material bearing upon this point. And the first question that would seem to arise is, whether the' t\u00e9rm estate, as here used, will extend to. the interest which the debtor has in lands held adversely.. An estate in lands, tenements, and hereditaments, signifies such interest as a person has therein, and is, the con dition or circumstance in which the owner stands with regard to his property. Coke, sec. 345. a. 2 Black. Com. 103.\nThe language of the act is broad, enough to include a right of entry and there can be no reason to believe that such was not the intention of the legislature.\nThe doctrine of the court of common pleas in England; in the case of Smith vs. Coffin, 2 H. Black. 461, has a strong bearing upon this question. The language of this absconding debtor act, with respect to the estate of the debtor to which .it shall extend, is as broad as that of the English bankrupt laws, and the same policy is involved in the construction. In the case r.ef\u00e9rred to, tfie court say, the plain spirit.of the bankrupt Jaw is, \u2022 that every beneficial' interest which the bankrupt has, shall be disposed of for the benefit of his creditors. On general principles, rights of action are notassigna-. ble, but that- is a rule founded on the policy of the comm.on \u2022law, which \u00a1S\u2019averse to encouraging litigation. But the policy of the bankrupt law requires that the right of action should be assignable, and transferred to. assignees, as much as any other species of property. Its policy is, that every right, belonging in any shape to the bankrupt, should pass to the assignees.\nThe estate of the debtor, under the New York statute, becomes vested in the trustees, by the mere act and operation of law, without any assignment-\nThe courts in New York have given a literal construction to this act, whenever it has,come under consideration, so as to reach all the property of the absconding debtor.. In the matter of Smith, an absconding debtor, 16 Johns. 107, .the broad rule is laid down that an attachment under this act is analogous to an execution. And in the case of Handy vs. Dobbin, 12 Johns. 220, when the proceeding was under another statute, 1 Rev. Laws, 398, very analogous to \u2019 the one under consideration, the court say, there can be no doubt that the constable, under the attachment, could take any goods and chattels which could be levied on by execution. The authority in both cases is the same. And in Jackson vs. Varick, 7 Cowen, 244, it is laid down as a rule admitting-off no doubt, that a right of entry may be taken and sold under an execution.\nIt is s.aid, however, that this right of entry does not pass, because, by the tenth, section of the act, it is declared, that the deeds given by the trustees shall be as valid as if made by the debtor, and that the debtor could not make a valid deed of lands held at the time .adversely.\nThis objection does not -apply to the case .: the question does not arise upon the operation of a .deed given :by the trustees. The point is, whether the trustees themselves had any interest in these lands: not whether they would give a valid deed for them, before reducing the right to possession. If it should be admitted that they could not, it would not.affect the presept, question. The right is vested' in the trustees by operation of law, the act, declaring that the estate shall 'be deemed vested in them on their appointment, and,that they shall be capable to sue for and recover the same; implying thereby that.a suit may be necessary to reduce the estate of. possession.\nAgain, it is said, that after such a lapse of time, it is to\" be presumed that all the-debts of Paul R. Randall have been paid, and the trust of course satisfied; and that the estate thereupon became revested in Paul R. Randall.\nThis-objection admits of-several answers. It does not appear properly to -\u2022arise-under the point stated.. But the question intended to be put would seem to be, whether the right, being a mere right of entry* passed, and became vested in the trustees. If it. did so^vest, it could not be revested, except by a reconveyance, or by operation of law, resulting from a-performance of the trust, by paying off all the debts of the absent debtor. And whether these debts have been satisfied, is a proper subject of inquiry for the grand assize. There is not enough before this dourt to enable it to decide that point. It is a question of fact, and not of law. If it was-'admitted that all the debts have been satisfied,- the effect of such satisfaction would -be a question of law. The evidence might probably warrant the grand assize in presuming payment; but even that may not be perfectly clear: The order of. the court upon the trustees to pay to the agent or attorney of Paul R. Randall five thousand five hundred dollars, out of the money remaining in their hands, does not purport to consider this sum as the surplus after payment of all the debts. . It was to be paid out of the moneys remaining in the hands of the trustees, thepeby fully implying, that their trust was hot closed.. And if the fact of payment and satisfaction of the debts.is left at all doubtful, this court cannot say, as matter of law, that the interest in the land became revested in Paul R. Randall. It must'depend upon the finding of- the grand assize!\nIt is objected, however, that the defence set up, - and embraced in the two last questions, is inadmissible. That in a writ of right, the tenant cannot, under the mise joined, set up title, out of himself, and in a third person.. That if is a question of mere right between the demandant and the tenant. And it has been supposed, that this is the doctrin\u00e9 of this court in the case of Green vs. Liter, 8 Cranch, 229. If any thing that fell from the court in that case will give countenance to such a doctrine, it is done away by the explanation given.by the court in Green vs. Watkins, 7 Wheat. 31.; and. it is there laid down, that the tenant may give in evidence, the title of a third person, for the purpose of disproving the demandant\u2019s seisin. That a writ of right; does bring into controversy the mere right of the parties to the suit, and if so, it, by consequence, authorises either party to establish by evidence, that the other has no right whatever in the demanded premises; or that his mere right is inferior to that set up against him. And this is the rul\u00e9 recognized in .the supreme court of New York. In the case of Ten Eyck vs. Waterberry, 7 Cowen, 52, the court say, that in a writ of right, the mise puts the seisin in issue, as the plea of not guilty in ejectment puts in issue the title, and that under the mise any thing may be given in evidence, except collateral warranty,. The same rule is laid down by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in the case of Poor vs. Robinson, 10 Mass. Rep. 131; and such appears to be the well settled rule in the English courts. Booth, 98, 115, 112. 3 Wilson, 420. 2 W. Black. Rep. 292. 2 Saund. 45 f. note 4. Stearns on Real Actions, 227, 228, 372.\nThe answer to this question will accordingly be in the affirmative, unless the -grand assize shall find that the trusts have been fully performed; and if so, the interest.iu the land will by operation of law become. revested in Paul R. Randall,\nV. Another point submitted to this court is, whether, inasmuch as the count in.the cause is for the entire -right in the premises, the. demandant can recover a less quantity than the entirety.\nThis is rather matter of form, without involving materially the merits of the case. And as .the action itself has becpme almost obsolete, it cannot be very important how the point is settled. I have not therefore pursued the question t\u00f3.see how it would stand upon British authority. The leaning of the courts in that country is against the action, and against even, allowing almost any amendments, holding parties -to the most strict and rigid rules of pleading; and it may be that .the .pnglish .courts would consider, that the recovery must be according to the count. But whatever the rule may be there, I think it-is in a great measure a matter of practice, and that we are at liberty .to adopt o\u00fcr rule on this subjeGt. -And no prejudice can arise to the tenant by allowing the demandant to have judgment for \u00e1nd recover according to the right which, upon the trial, he' shall establish in the demanded premises. The cases referred to, showing that a demandant may abridge his plaint, do not apply to a writ of right. . This is confined to the action of assize, and authorised by statute 21 Hen, 8, ch. 3. This statute has. been adopted in New York, 1 Rev. Laws, 88, but does not help the case.. But independent of any statutory provision, I see no good reason why the. demandant should not be allowed to recover according to the interest prov\u00e9d, if less than that which he has demanded.\nIt is the settled practice in the supreme judicial court in Massachusetts, in \u00e1 writ of entry, to allow the demandant.to recover an undivided part ot the demanded premises. The technical ..objection, that the verdict and judgment do not agree with the count, is deemed unimportant; the title being the same as to duration and quality, and differing only in the degree of interest between a sQle tenancy and a tenancy in common; The tenant cannot be prejudiced by allowing this. He is presumed to know his own title, an,d might have dis claimed. The courts in that state consider, that with respect to the right to renew a part of the land claimed, there is no distinction between a writ of entry and an action of ejectment. 2 Pick. 387. 3 Pick. 52. Nor is it perceived that any well founded distinction, in this respect, can be made, be-: tween the action of ejectment and a writ of right.\nThe opinion of the court upon this point is, that under a count for the entire right, a demandant may recover a less quantity than'the entirety."},{"case_name":"The Trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association vs. Smith and Robertson, 4 Wheat. 1","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/3305627\/","date":"1830-01-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Story J.\nCharitable donations were of great consideration in the civil lawr arid bequests to pious uses were deemed privileged testaments( ). There can be little doubt that the authority of the Roman code, combining with the religious notions of former times, contributed in no small degree to engraft the principles of that law respecting charities into the common law. \u2018 This was manifestly the opinion of lord Thrirlow( );, and lord Eldon, in assenting to it has added, that, as at. an early period the ordinary had authority to apply a portion of every man\u2019s estate to charity, when after-wards the statute compelled a distribution, it is riot impossible that the same favour should have been extended to charity in trier construction of wills! by thejb own force purporting..to.authorise such a distribution( ). Be this as\nit may, it cannot be denied that many of the privileges given tb charitable-testaments, by, the civil law have been for ages incorporated into the common law. For instance, one privilege was that no - such testament was void for uncertainty either as to persons or objects. Hence, if a testator gave his goods to be distributed among the poor, or. made the poor his executors, the legacy was.not void; although- it would have been otherwise, if charity had not been the legatee( ). And the same rule has been adopted into the common law, at least ever since the statute of charitable uses( ). Indeed, at one period, the constructions in respect to charitable bequests were pushed to a most extravagant length;. apd. the good sense of succeeding timesjias lamented, and as far. as, it consistently .could, has ende\u00e1voured to ab\u00edidg\u00e9; the ancient doctrine to something like _a,rational system( ). It is now too late to contend that a disposition in favpur of charity can be construed according to the rules which are applicable. to individuals. In the first place, thq same words in a will, when applied to individuals, may. require a very different construction, if applied to the case of a charity; If a testator' give his property to such jperspn a\u00e1 he shall hereafter name to be his executor, and .afterwards appoint no executor.; or, if, having- appointed an. executor, he dies in his life tim\u00e9, and no other, is appointed', in. his place, in. either of these cases, as to individuals, the testator must be held intestate,, and.his. next, of kin will take the estate. But to give effect to a bequest in favour of cha-. rity, \u00a1chancery will in both instances supply the place of ah executor, and qarry into effect tha-twhich in the case of individuals must have failed altbgether( ). Again, in the-case of an individual, if an estate is devised to . such pensonas the executor shall name,- and no executor, is- appointed, or one. being appointed dies in the testator\u2019s life time, and no one is appointed in .his place, the bequest amounts to nothing. Yet such-a bequest to charity would be good, and the court of chancery would in such case assume the office of executor( ). So if a legacy be given to trustees to distri-imte in charity, and they die in, the testator\u2019s life time, although the legacy is lapsed at law, (and if they, had -taken to their own use it would have, been gone for ever), yet in equity it will be enforced( ). Again, although in carrying into execution a bequest to an individual, the mode in which the legacy is to fake effect must be of the substance of the legacy, yet where, charity is the legatee, the court will consider it as the whole substance of the bequest; and in such cases only, if the mode fail,, will provide a mode by which that legatee shall take, but by which no other than charitable legatees can take( ). A still stronger case is, that if the testator has expressed an absolute-intention to give a legacy to charitable purposes, but has left uncertain* or to some future act, the mode by which it is to be carried into effect, there the court of chancery, if no mode is. pointed out, , will of itself supply the defect and enforce the charity( ).' Therefore it has heen held,- that if a man devises a sum of.money to sueh charitable uses as he shall direct by a codicil to be annexed to his wil], or by a note in writing, and afterwards leaves-no direction by note or codicil, the court of chancery hath power to dispose of it to such charitable uses as it sh\u00e1ll think fit( ). So if a testator -bequeath a sum for such a school as he should appoint, and he appoints none, the court may apply it for what school it pleases( ). The doctrine has gohe yet farther, and established that if the bequest denote a charitable intention, but the object to which it is to be applied is against the policy of the law, the court will lay hold of the .charitable intention, and execute it for. the purpose of some charity agreeable to the law, in the room of that cohtrary to it.( ) Thus a sum of money bequeathed to found a Jew\u2019s synagogue, has been taken hy the court, according to this principle, and transferred to the benefit of a foundling hospital( ).' And a bequest for the education of poor children in the Roman catholic faith, has been decreed to be disposed of according to the pleasure of the king, under his sign manual ( ). Another principle equally well established is, that if the bequest be for charity, it matters not how uncertain the objects or persons may be.; or whether the bequest can be carried into exact execution or not; or whether the persons who are to take be in esse or not; or whether the legatee be a corporation capable in law to take or not; in all these and the like cases the court will sustain the legacy, and give it effect according to its own principles, and where a literal execution becomes inexpedient or impracticable, will execute it cy pres. Attorney General vs. Oglander, 3 Bro. Ch. 166. Attorney General vs. Green, 3 Bro. Ch. 492, Freer vs. Peacock, Rep. temp. Finch, 245. Attorney General vs. Barltree, 2 Ves. Jun. 380. Duke, 108 to 113. Thus a devise of lands to the church wardens of a parish (wh\u00f3 \u00e1re not a corporation capable of taking lands), for a charitable purpose, though void at law, will be sustained in equity( ). So if the corporation for whose use it is designed is not in esse, and cannot come into existence, but by some.future act of the crown, as for instance, a. gift to found a new coll\u00e9ge, which requites ari incorporation, the gift is valid, and the court will execute it( ). So if a devise be to an existing corporation by a misnomer, which makes it void at law( ). So where a devise was. to the poor generally, the court decreed it to be executed in favour t)f three public hospitals in London( ). So a legacy towards establishing a. bishop in America was held gpod, though none was yet appointed( ). And where a charity is so given that there can be no objects, the court will order a different scheme of the charity ; but it is otherwise .if objects may, though they do not at present exist( ); and When objects cease to exist, the court will new model the charity( ). And in aid of these principles the court will, in all cases of charities, supply all defects in the conveyances, where the dpnor hath a capacity and a disposable estate, and his mode of donation does not contravene the provisions of any statute( ).\nSome of these doctrines- may seem strange to us, as they have also seemed to lord Eldon; but he considered the cases too stubborn to be shaken without doing that in effect which no judge will in terms take upon himself, to reverse decisions that have been acted upon for centuries( ).\nIf, therefore, the present case had arisen in England since the statute of charitable uses, 43 Elizabeth, ch.4, there can be no doubt that it would have been established as a valid be quest, notwithstanding it is given to an .unincorporated sOciety( ). The only question would have been, whether it ought to be administered by a scheme under the direction of the court of chancery, or by the king himself, as parens patrise, under his sign manual. As to this, the rule which has been drawn by lord Eldon, from a most learned and critical examination of all the authorities is, that where there is a bequest to trustees for charitable purposes, the disposition must be in chancery under a scheme tobe approved by a master; but where the object is charity,' and no trust is interposed, it must be by the king,- under his sign manual; for in such cases the king, as parens patrise, is deemed the constitutional trustee( )'.\nBut the statute of Elizabeth not being in force in Virginia at the time when the present will took effect, (it having been repealed by the legislature between the making of the will and the death of the testator), it becomes a material inquiry, how far the jurisdiction and doctrines of the court of chancery respecting charitable uses depends upon that statute, and whether, independent of it, the present donation can be upheld.\nIt is not easy to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion on this head. New traces remain of the exercise of this jurisdiction in any shape prior to the statute of Elizabeth. The principal, if not the only cases now to be found, were decided in the. courts of common law, and turned upon the question, whether the uses were void or not within the statutes against superstitious uses. One of the earliest cases. is Porter\u2019s case(c); which was a devise of lands devisable by custom to the testator\u2019s wife in fee, upon condition that she should assure the lands devised for the maintenance and continuance of a free school and certain almsmen and alms-women ; and it'appeared that the heir had entered for condition broken, and conveyed the same lands to the queen. It was held that the-use being for charity, was a good and lawful use, and not void by the statutes against superstitious uses, and that the queen might well hold the land for the charitable uses. - Lord Eldon in commenting on this.case has observed, \u201c it does notappear that this court (i. e. chancery) at that period had cognizance upon informations for the establishment of charities. Prior \"to the time of lord Ellesmere( ), as far as the tradition of times immediately following goes, there were no such, informations as that upon which I am now sitting (i. e. an information to establish a charity); but they made out. their case as well as they could by law\u201d( ). So that the result of lord Eldon\u2019s researches on this point is, that until about the period of enacting the. statute of Elizabeth, bills were not filed in chancery to.establish charities ; and it is remarkable that sir Thomas Egerton and lord Coke, who argued Porter\u2019s case for the queen, though they cited many antecedent cases, refer to none which were not decided at law- And the doctrine established by Porter\u2019s case is, that if a feoffment is made to a general legal use, not superstitious, though indefinite, though no person is in esse who could be the cestui que use, yet the feoffment is good; and if the use was bad, the heir of the feoffor would be entitled to enter, the legal \u201cestate remaining in him( ). The absence therefore of all authority derived from equity decisions ; on an occasion when they would probably have been used, if existing; certainly does very much favour the conclusion of lord Eldon; and if we might hazard a conjecture, it would be, that Porter\u2019s case having established charitable uses, not superstitious, to be good at law, chancery, in-analogy to other cases of trusts, immediately held the feoffees to such uses accountable in equity for the due execution of them; and that the inconveniences felt in resorting to this new and anomalous proceeding, froth the indefinite nature. of some of the uses, gave rise within a. very few years to the statute of 43 Elizabeth( ). This view would have a great tendency to reconcile the language used on other occasions by other chancellors, in reference to the jurisdiction of chancery, over charities, with that of lord Eldon; as it would show, that in cases of feoffments to charitable uses, bills to establish those uses might in fact have been introduced by lord Ellesmere about five years before the statute of Elizabeth; which might be quite consistent with the fact that such bills were not sustained where the donation was to charity generally, and no trust was interposed or legal estate devised to support the uses. And it is very certain that at law a devise to charitable uses generally, without interposing a trustee, or a devise to a non-existing corporation, or to an unincorporated society,.would have been, and in fact was. held, utterly void for want of a person having a sufficient capacity to take as devisee( ).' The statute of Elizabeth in favour of charitable uses .cured this defect( ), arid-provided (as we shall hereafter have occasion more immediately-to consider) a new mode of enforcing such uses by a commission under the direction of the court of chancery. Shortly after this statute it became a matter of doubt whether'the court could grant relief by original bill in cases within that statute, or was not confined to the remedy by commission. That doubt remained until the reign of Charles II. when it was settled in favour of the jurisdiction by original bill( ). But on one occasion, in which this very question was argued before him, lord keeper Bridgman declared \u201c that the king, as pater patriae, may inform for any public benefit for charitable uses, before the statute of 30 [43] of Elizabeth for charitable uses; but it-was doubted the court could not by bill take notice of that statute, so as to grant a relief according to that statute upon a bill( ).\u201d On another occasion, soon afterwards, where the devise was to a college, and held void at law by the judges for a misnomer, and on a bill to establish the devise as a charity, the same question was argued; lord keeper Finch (afterwards lord Nottingham) held the devise good as an appointment under the statute of Elizabeth, and \u201cdecreed the charity, though before the statute no such decree could have been made().\u201d\nIt would seem, therefore, to have been the opinion of lord Nottingham, that an original bill would not, before the statute of Elizabeth, lie to establish a charity where the estate did not pass at law, to which the charitable uses attached. In Eyre vs. Shaftesbury(), sir Joseph Jekyll said, in the course of his reasoning on another point, \u201c in like manner, in the case of charity, the king, pro bono publico, has an original.right to superintend the care thereof, so that, abstracted from the statute of Elizabeth relating to charitable uses, and antecedent to it, as well as since, it has been every day\u2019s practice to.file informations in chancery in the attorney general\u2019s name, for the-establishment of charities.\u201d In the Bailiffs, &c. of Burford vs. Lenthall( ), lord Hardwicke is reported to have said, \u201cthe courts have mixed the jurisdiction of bringing in-formations in the name of the attorney general, with the jurisdiction given them under the statute of Elizabeth, and proceed either way, according to their discretion.\u201d. In a subsequent case ( ), which was an information filed by the attorney general against the master and governors of a s\u00e9hool, calling.them to account in chancery, as having the general superintendency of all charitable donations, the same learned chance^or, in discussing the general jurisdiction of chancery on this head, and distinguishing the case before him from others, because the trustees or governors were invested with the visitatorial power; said, \u201c consider the nature \u00f3f the foundation; it is at the petition of two private persons, by charter of the crown, which distinguishes this case from cases of the statute of Elizabeth on charitable uses, or cases before that statute, in which this court exercised jurisdiction of charities at large. Since that statute, where there is a charity for the particular purposes therein, and no charter given by the crown to found and- regulate it, unless a particular exception out of. the statute, it must be regulated by commission. But there may be a bill by information in this court, founded on its general jurisdiction ; and that is from necessity, because there is no charter, to regulate it, and the king has a general jurisdiction of this kind. There must-be somewhere a power to reg\u00falate; but where there is a charter with proper powers, there is no ground to come into this court to establish that charity; and it must be left to be regulated, in the manner the charter has put it, or by the original rules of law. Therefore, though I have often heard it said in this. court, if an information is brought to establish a charity, and praying a particular relief and mode of regulation, and the party fails in tnat particular relief, yet that information is not to be dismissed, but there must be a decree for the establishment; that is, always with this distinction, where it is a charity at large, or in its nature before the statute of charitable uses; but not in the case of charities incorporated and established by the king\u2019s charter, under the great seal, which are established by proper a\u00fathority allowed.\u201d And again, \u201c it is true, that an information in the name of the attorney general, as an officer of the crown, was not a head of the statute of charitable uses, because that original jurisdiction was exercised in this court before; but that was always in cases now provided for. by that statute, that is, charities at large\u00a1, not properly and regularly provided for in charters of ihe crown\u201d\nIt was manifestly, therefore, the opinion of lord Hardwicke, that, independent of the statute \u00f3f Elizabeth, the court of chancery did exercise original jurisdiction in cases of charities at large, which he explains to mean charities not regulated by charter; but it does not appear that his attention was called to discriminate between .such as could take effect at law, by reason of the interposition of a feoffee or devisee capable of taking, and those 'where the purpose was general charity, without the. interposition of any trust to carry it into effect; and the same remark applies to the dictum by sir Joseph Jekyll. In a still, later case( ), which was an information to establish a charity and aid a conveyance in remainder to certain officers of Christ\u2019s college to certain charitable uses, lord keeper Henley (after-wards lord Northington) is reported to have said, \u201c the conveyance is admitted to be defective, the use being limited to certain officers of the corporation, and not to the corporate body; and therefore there is a want of proper persons to take in perpetual succession. The only doubt is, whether the court shall supply this defect for the benefit of tlje charity under the statute of Elizabeth. And I take the uniform rule of this, court, before, at and after the statute of Elizabeth, to have been, that where the uses are charitable, and the person has in himself full power to convey, the court will aid a defective conveyance to such uses. Thus, though devises to corporations were void under the statute of. Henry VIII., yet they were always considered as good in equity, if given to charitable uses.\u201d And he then proceeds tq declare, that he is. oblig d, by the uniform course of precedents, to assist, this conveyance, and therefore establishes the conveyance expressly under the statute of Elizabeth.\nThere is some reason to question, if the language here im-. puted to lord Northington be minutely accurate. His lordship manifestly aids the conveyance, as a charity, in virtue, of the statute of Elizabeth; and there is no doubt that it has been the constant practice of the court since that statute, to aid defects in conveyances to charitable uses. But there is no case in which such defects were aided before that statuteThe old cases, though arising before, were deemed to be within the reach of that statute, by its retrospective language, and expressly decided on that ground( ). And the very case put of devises to corporations, which are void under the statute of Henry VIII.j and are held good solely by the statute of Elizabeth, shows that his lordship was looing to that statute; for it is plain, that a devise, void by statute, cannot be made good upon any principles of general law. What therefore is supposed to have been stated by him as being the practice before the statute, is probably founded-in the mistake of the reporter. The same case is reported in Ambler, 351, where the language is, \u201cthe constant rule of the court has always been, where a person has a power to. give, and makes a defective conveyance to charitable uses, to supply it as an appointment ; as in Jesus\u2019 college, Collin-son\u2019s case in Hobart, 136.\u201d Now Collinson\u2019s case was expressly held to-be sustainable, only as an appointment, under the statute of Elizabeth; and this shows that the language is limited to case's governed by thaLstatute.\nIn \u00e1 very recent charity case, sir Arthur Piggotf in argument said, \u201c the difference between the case of individuals and that of charities, is founded on a principle which has been established ever since the statute of charitable uses, in the reign of Elizabeth, and has been constantly acted upon from those days to the present;\u201d and lord Eldon adopted the remark, and said, \u201c I am fully satisfied as to all the principles laid down in the course of this argument, and accede to them all.\u201d His lordship then proceeds to discuss the most-material of the principles and cases from the time of Elizabeth, and builds his reasoning; as indeed he had built it before, upon the supposition that the doctrine in chancery, as now established, rested mainly on that statute( ). And his lordship\u2019s opinion, in the case alluded to( ), when commenting on Porter\u2019s case, is entitled to the more weight, because it seems to\u2018have been given after a very careful examination of the whole judicial history of charities.\nThese are all the cases which the researches of the court and of counsel have enabled them to find, where the jurisdiction of chancery over charities antecedent to the statute of Elizabeth has been directly or incidentally discussed. The circumstance that no cases prior to that tim\u00e9 can be found ' in equity; the tradition that has passed down to our own times, that original bills to establish charities were first entertained in the time of lord Ellesmere ; and the fact that the cases immediately succeeding that statute, where devises; void at law, vVere held good as charities, might have' been argued and sustained upon the general jurisdiction of the court, if it existed, and yet were exclusively argued and decreed upon the footing of that- statute; do certainly afford a very strong presumption that' the jurisdiction of the court.to enforce charities, where no trust was interposed, and where no devisee was in esse, or where the charity was general and indefinite- both as to' persons and objects, mainly rests upon constructions (whether ill or well founded is now of no consequence) of that statute.\nIt is very certain, also, that since the statute of Elizabeth, no bequests, are deemed within the authority of chancery to establish and-regulate, except bequests for those purposes which that statute enumerates as charitable, or which, by analogies, are deemed within .its spirit and intendment. A bequest may be in an enlarged sense charitable, and yet not within the purview of the statute. Charity, as the master of the rolls has justly observed, in its widest sense, denotes all the good affection men ought to bear towards each other; in its more restricted and common sense, relief to the poor..\nIn neither of these senses is it employed in the court of chancery( ). In that court it means such only as are within the letter and the spirit of the statute of Elizabeth * and therefore, where a testatrix bequeathed the residue of her personal estate to the bishop of I). to dispose of the same \u201c to such objects of benevolence and liberality as the bishop in his own discretion shall most approve of,\u201d and appointed the bishop her executor;. on a bill to establish the will and declare the residuary bequest void, the court held the bequest void upon the ground that objects of benevolence and liberality were not necessarily charitable within the statute of Elizabeth, and were therefore too indefinite to be executed. The court further declared, that no case had yet been de^ cided in which the court had executed a charitable purpose, unless the will contained a description of that which the law acknowledges a charitable purpose, or devoted the property to purposes of charity in general, in the sense in which that word is used in the court. That the case was therefore the case of a trust of so indefinite a nature, that it could not be under the control of the court, so that the administration of it could be reviewed by the court, or if the trustee died, the court itself could execute the trust. That it fell therefore within the rule, of the court that where a trust is ineffectually declared, or fails, or becomes incapable of taking effect, the party taking shall be a trustee, if ,not for those who were to take by the will, for those who take.under the disposition of the law; and the residue was accordingly decreed to the next of kin.\nSo that it appears, since the statute of Elizabeth, the couft of chancery will not establish any trusts for indefinite purposes of a benevolent.nature, riot charitable within the purview of that statute, although there be an existing trustee in whom it is vested; but will declare the trust void, and distribute the property among the next of kin : and yet, if there was an original jurisdiction in chancery over all be quests charitable in their own nature, and not superstitious, to establish and regulate them, independent of the statute, it is not.easy to perceive why an original bill might not be sustained in such court to establish such bequest, especially where a trustee is interposed to effectuate it; for the statute does not contain any prohibition of such bequests. An argument may therefore be, fairly drawn from this source against a general jurisdiction in chancery over charities of an indefinite nature prior to the statute.\nAnd the statute itself may be resorted to as affording an additional argument in corroboration of the opinion already expressed. It begins by a recital that lands, goods, money, &c. \u00abfee. had been given; \u00abfee. heretofore to certain, purposes, which it enumerates in detail, which lands, \u00abfee. had not been employed according to the charitable intent of the givers and founders, by reason of frauds, breaches, of . trusts, and negligence in those that should pay, deliver, and employ the same. It then enacts, that it shall be lawful for the lord chancellor, \u00abfee. to award commissions under the great seal to proper persons to inquire, by juries, of all and singular such gifts, <&'c. breaches of trusts, \u00abfee. in respect to such gifts, \u00abfee. heretofore given, \u00abfee. or which shall hereafter be given, \u00abfee. \u201c to or for any, the charitable and godly uses before rehearsed;\u201d and upon such inquiry, to set down such orders, judgments and decrees; as the lands, &c. may be duly and .faithfully employed to and for such charitable uses before rehearsed, for which they were given; \u201c which orders,. judgments and decrees, not being contrary, to the orders, statutes, or decrees of the donors or founders, shall stand firm and good according to the tenor ahd purpose thereof, arid, shall be executed accordingly, until the same shall be undone and altered by the lord chancellor, &fc. upon complaint.by any party grieved, to be made to them.\u201d Then follow several provisions^ excepting certain cases from the operation-of the statute, which are not now-piaterial to be considered. The statute then directs the orders, \u00abfee. of the commissioners to be returned under seal into the court of' chancery, \u00abfee. and declares .that the lord chancellor, \u00abfee. shall, and may \u201c take such order for the due execution of all or any of the said judgments, orders and decrees, as to them, shall seem fit and convenientand lastly, the.statute enacts that any person aggrieved with any such orders, &c. may complain to the lord, chancellor, &c. for redress therein; and upon such complaint the lord chancellor, &c. may, by such, course as to their,wisdom shall seem meetest, the circumstances of the case .considered, proceed to the examination, hearing and determining thereof; \u201c and upon hearing thereof, shall arid may annul, diminish, alter, or enlarge the' said orders, judgments, and decrees of the said commissioners as to. them shall'be thought to stand with equity and good conscience, according to the true intent and meaning of the donors and founders thereof;\u201d arid may tax and award costs against the persons complaining with just and sufficient cause-qf the orders, judgments, and decrees-before mentioned.( )\nFrom this summary statement of the contents of the statute,' it is apparent that the authority conferred on the court qf chancery in relation to charitable uses is very extensive; and it is not. at all .wonderful, considering the religious notions of the times, that the statute should have received the most liberal, not to say in some instances the most extravagant, interpretation. And it is very easy .to perceive how it came to pass, that as power- was given to the court in. the most unlimited terms to annul, diminish, alter or .enlarge the orders and decrees of the commissioners, and to sustain an original bill in favour of any party grieved by such order or decree, the .coprt arrived at the conclusion that it might by original bill do that , iri the first instance, which it certainly Could do circuitously Upon the commission(b). . Arid,, as.in some cases, where the. trust w\u00e1s f\u00f3r a definite object, and the trustee living, the court'might, upon its ordinary jurisdiction over trusts, compel an execution of it by. an \u00a9ri ginal Kill, indep\u00e9ndent of the statute( ), we are at once let into the origin of the practice of mixing up the jurisdiction by original bill with the jurisdiction under the statute, which lord Hardwicke alluded to in the passage already quoted( ), and which at that time was inveterately established. And this mixture of the jurisdictions serves also to illustrate the remark of lord Nottingham in the case already cited( ); where, upon an original bill; he decreed a devise'to charity, void at law, to he good in equity as an appointment, though before the statute of Elizabeth no such decree could have been made.\nUpon the whole, it seems to me that the jurisdiction of the court of chancery over charities, where, no trust is interposed, or there is no person in esse capable of taking, or where the charity is of an indefinite nature, is not to be referred to the general jurisdiction of that court, but sprung up after the statute of Elizabeth, and rests mainly on its proyisions( ). This opinion is supported by the weight of authorities speaking to the .point, and particularly by those of a very recent date, which appear to have been most 'thoroughly considered. The language too of the statute lends a confirmation to the opinion, and enables us to trace what would otherwise seem a strange anomaly to a legitimate origin. If so, there is no pretence that by the law of Virginia, at the period when this will took effect, the statute of Elizabeth was then in force) or that any court of equity of that state could sustain the bequest in equity as a charity; if it was void at law. And .that it was void at law, cannot be seriously doubted; for the legatees were not then a corporate society capable of taking it( ); and it is a maxim that the legacy must take effect at the death of the testator, or be, void at that time, and the right vest in another( ). And if a court of chancery could not in virtue of its general jurisdiction t\u00e1ke cognizance of, or sustain the bequest in this suit, neither can the circuit court of the United States.\nIf we could surmount the objection already considered, that this bequest is under the present law of Virginia de\u00e9med void both in law and equity, and therefore incapable of being decreed by this court, we might entertain the other questions which have been made in this court. One of these questions is, whether this.court, as a court of equity, has a right to administer any charities, the administration of which would properly belong to the government of Virginia as parens patriae. It is certainly stated in books of authority, that the king, as parens patriae, has the general superintendence of all charities not regulated by charter( ), which he \u00e9xercises by the keeper of his conscience, the Chancellor; and therefore the attorney general, at the relation of some informant, when it is necessary, files, ex officio, an information in the court of chancery to have the charity properly established. And it is added, \u2022 that the jurisdiction thus exerciseu does not belong to the court of chancery as a court of equity, but as administering the prerogative and duties of the crown(). It may be safely admitted that the government of a state, as parens patriae, has a right to enforce all charities of a public nature, by virtue of its general superintending authority over the public interests, where no other person is entrusted with it; and it seems also to be held, that the jurisdiction vested by the statute of Elizabeth over charitable uses is. personal to the lord chancellor, and' notip nis ordinary or extraordinary jurisdiction in chancery, like 'that, in short, which he exercises as to lunatics and idiots( ).\nIt'may also be admitted, that where money is given to charity generally and indefinitely, without trustees or objects s\u00e9lected, the king, as parens patriae, is the constitutional trustee, aftd may apply it as he pleases under his sign manual, and not under a'decree of chancery (). Where, however, the execution is to be by a trustee with general or some objects pointed out, or to a trustee for indefinite and general charity, the court of chancery will take the administration of the trust( ). Whether in such a case upon an original bill to establish the charity, the lord chancellor acts a\u00e1 the personal delegate of the crown, administering its prerogative in analogy to the authority personally given to him by the statute of ^charitable' uses und\u00e9r a commission; or Whether as a court of equity in virtue of its general powers, may perhaps upon the authorities admit of some question ; though my opinion is that it belongs ,to the court, as a. court of equity, exercising jurisdiction to enforce a trust recognized and enforced by the law of the land; and I think this opinion is corroborated by the better authorities( ). Be this as it may, where there is a trust for a definite object, and the trust is in point of law sustainable, there seems no reason why a court of equity, as suchj may not take cognizance of such, trust at the suit 6fvany competent party, whether the attorney general, or'a private interested relator, as .well, as of any other trust whose execution is sought( ). If therefore by the law of Virginia the beq[uest in this case had been valid in l\u00e1w. or. eqUi.ty, :the trustees being marked out, and the objects being-definite, there does not seem any reason why at their instance it might, not have been exe cuted in this as well as hi any other court of equity. The court in such a case would carryrinto effect the intention of the testator ; nothing wo\u00fald be left to its discretion'! and it would therefore do precisely what a state court of chancery must, do, acting as such, or administering the prerogative of the government as parens patriae.\nIn respect to another question, whether the attorney general be not a necessary party to a bill in equity to establish a charity or carry it into effect, that must depend upon circumstances. If the charity be indefinite, or there be no trustees, or no persons competent to take, or the objects be' of a general and public nature, it would cl\u00e9arly.be proper that the government to whomqthe superintendency of 6uch charities belongs, should be made a party to the bill by their attorney general. This seems to have been the general course'established by the authorities( ). But'where, the charity is definite in its nature, and trustees are appointed to take or execute it, it is not perceived why a suit at the instance of such trustees may not properly be maintained without the government being a party( ).\nAnother question which has been discussed in the argument is, whether- a court of equity sitting within one jurisdiction, can execute any charitable bequests for foreign objects in another, jurisdiction j and it is said, in a technical sense, to be against.the public policy of Virginia to sustain or execute such bequests. There is no statute of Virginia making such bequests void ; -and'therefore, if. against her policy, it can be only because it would be against the general, policy of all states governed by the common law. The case, of the Attorney General vs. The City of London( ), is relied on to establish the general proposition. It was an in iormation to establish a new' scheme for a charity of Mr Boyle, who by his will in 1691 gave the residue of his fortune tobe laid out by his executors for charitable and oth\u00e9r pious and good uses, at their discretion, but recommended that the greater part should be laid out for.th\u00e9 advancement of the Christian religion among infidels. The charity had-been established under a decree of the court, and the property conveyed to the city of London upon trust to lay out. the'rents and profits in the advancement of the Christian religion, as the bishop of London, for the time being, and lord' Burlington should appoint. The trustees appointed the rents and profits to be paid to an agent in London, for the college of Williamf and Mary, in Virginia, for this purpose, that the college should maintain and educate in.the Christian religion so many Indian children\", as far as the fund would go,-and that the president, &c. thereof, should transmit accounts, and should be subject to rules given them yntil altered. This arrangement was ratified by the court. After the revolution, the present bill was filed for the purpose of taking away the charity from the college, because emancipated from the control of the court, and to have it disposed-of by a new scheme. Upon hearing the cause a decree was made ac cordingly, upon the ground that the trusts to the college to convert neighbouring infidels ceasing for want of objects, (there being now, as the court said, no neighbouring infidels), the charity must be applied anew( ). There was also an intimation at the argument, that the corporation was not now an existing corporation, and at all events was not within the control of the court. ' But the ground of the- decision was as above stated. It is observable in this case, that the charity of Mr Boyle was not in terms or substance limited \u2022to foreign- countries or objects; but the application to foreign objects was originally under the decreevof the court.. It certainly then furnishes no argument against, but an argument in fav'-ur of the power of a court of equity, to apply even a general charity to \u00bffomgnobjects. .\nBut we need not rest here. There are other cases directly in point, in which bequests for foreign charitable objects have been sustained in equity. In the Provost, &c. of Edinburgh vs. Aubury( ), there was a devise.of three thousand five hundred pounds, south sea annuities, to the plaintiffs, to be applied to the maintenance of poor labourers residing in Edinburgh and the towns adjacent. Lord Hardwicke was of opinion, that he could not give any directions as to the distribution of the money, that belonging'to another jurisdiction, that is, to some of the courts in Scotland j and therefore directed that the annuities should be transferred to such person as the plaintiffs should appoint, to be.applied to the trusts in the will. So in Oliphant vs. Hendrie( ), where A. by will gave three-hundred pounds to a religious society in Scotland, to be laid out in the purchase of heritable securities in Scotland, and the interest thereof to be applied to the education of twelve poor children, the court held it a good bequest. That case approaches very near to the case now at bar. In Campbell vs. Radnor( ), the ...court held a bequest of seven thousand pounds, to be laid out in the purchase of lands in Ireland, and the rents and profits distributed hmong poor persons in Ireland, &e. to be good and valid in law. In Curtis vs. Hutton( ), the court held a bequest of personal estate for the maintenance of a charity (a college) in Scotland, to be a valid bequest. In a still more recent case, a bequest of ten thousand pounds in trust with the magistrates of Inverness in Scotland, to apply the interest and income for the education of certain boys, was held a valid bequest( ). There is also another case( ), in which it was held that a legacy , given towards establishing a bishop in Amerjca was held good, notwithstanding none was yet appointed; apd the court directed the money to remain in court, until it should be seen whether any appointment should take place. Nor is the uniformity of the current of the authorities broken, in upon by the doctrine in De Garcin vs. Lawson( ). There, the bequests were to. Roman Catholic establishments, or for the benefit of Roman Catholic priests, and were considered void, because they were illegal and contrary to the policy of England, evinced by the express enactments of statutes on this subject( ). It does not strike me, therefore, that there is any solid objection to the bequest in the case at bar, founded on the persons or objects being foreign to the state of Virginia.\nBut for the reasons already stated, the bequest being void, I am of opinion that the court ought to certify that opinion to the circuit court of Virginia.\na\n(\u0430) Swinburne, pl. 1, s. 16, p. 103.

Mitchell, Ordinary, et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2510208\/","date":"1831-03-01","court":"South Carolina Court of Appeals","content":"Johnson J.\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nThe case stated, supposes, that the relator, Simon Moses, fraudulently possessed himself of certain slaves, the property of an intestate estate, when there had been no application for administration, nor any granted; and the question raised, is, whether the ordinary was authorized under any circumstances, to issue process to the sheriff and his officers, commanding them to take the slaves out of the relator\u2019s possession, and deliver them to another. It is not necessary to refer to Magna Charta, or our own constitution, for the rule, that no one shall be disseized of his freehold, despoiled of his goods, or deprived of liberty, ov life, without being heard: nor otherwise than according to the forms of law. It is a rule of common right, and in some shape or other is engrafted upon the constitution of every civilized country. That it has been violated in this instance, is too palpable to admit of any doubt. The slaves were in possession of the relator, who claimed them in his own right. If he possessed himself of them without right, he subjected himself to an action of trespass, trover, or detinue, at the suit of him who had the right. Of such action our Courts of common law had exclusive jurisdiction, and in them the right of trial by jury is secured by the constitution. And yet the ordinary has assumed the power of deciding the question of right against him; and without making him a party to the proceedings, has awarded process h deprive him of the possession.\nIt seems that by the ancient common law of England, the right of administering the goods of one dying intestate, belonged to the crown ; and it is said by the ancient writers, that the King was intitled to seize them, as parens patriae, and general trustee of the kingdom. 2 Bl. Com. 494. And it has been contended in support of the ordinary, that he has succeeded to this branch of the prerogative; and if no one will administer, it becomes a matter of duty in him to seize the goods, to preserve them for those who are intitled, and prevent their being eloigned or destroyed. The act of 1789, P. L. 472, prescribes the mode in which the ordinary may obtain administration, and it may be questioned, whether he has any power over the goods of an intestate estate, without administration. But I have not thought it necessary to this case, to consider that question; for if it be conceded, still that would not justify his using force to obtain possession, and of his own head to lay violent hands on whatever he may please to claim in right of the intestate. When the books say that the King may seize the goods, I do not understand it to authorize lawless violence, but a seizure according to the forms of law: and the fact that the books con tain no memorial of a precedent for this most summary proceeding, is itself sufficient authority that none such ever was in use.\nThe necessity of using it as the means of protecting the rights of minors and others, under such like disabilities, has been resorted to in support of it. But that necessity can very rarely arise in practice. The stimulus of interest and humanity are generally found sufficient; and when these fail, the ordinary could not better manifest his paternal care over this unfortunate class of persons, than by administering himself, in the manner provided for in the act before referred to. If none of these should be found sufficient, then the minors are only in the same situation in this respect, that they are in relation to all other rights that devolve on them, or of which they are possessed. In any possible view this proceeding cannot be sustained. The motion is therefore granted; and it is ordered that a prohibition do issue, to restrain the execution of the process set out in the proceedings.\nProhibition granted."},{"case_name":"UNITED STATES v. NOURSE","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6131225\/","date":"1831-05-01","court":"United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia","content":"THE COURT\n(CRANCH, Chief Judge, not sitting) was of opinion that the United States had a right to appeal; and on a subsequent day, THRUSTON, Circuit Judge, delivered the opinion of the court (CRANCH, Chief J udge, not sitting on the appeal) :\nThe great question, in this cause, is: \u201cIs the appellee, as agent for the disbursement of certain contingent funds of the treasury department, library of congress, and other appropriations for public purposes, entitled to compensation for those disbursements?\u201d It is a single and a simple question; and can admit of no doubt, if the defendant be not barred by considerations connected with and growing out of his official duties as register of the treasury. The first point, then, is to examine those official duties. See the law declaring those duties. Here we see his duties as register, defined, among which we cannot discern that of receiving and paying public moneys. It is plain that he was not bound, as register, to receive or pay away public moneys, but he has, for a long course of years, received, paid away, and accounted for very large sums of public money. This must have been an extra duty, in nowise incident to his office of register. How came Mr. N. to have this duty imposed on him? We are told in the certificate of Oliver Wol-cott, in the year 1801, that Mr. Nourse had been \u201cemployed\u201d as agent for defraying the incidental and contingent expenses of the treasury department. Here we have evidence of the way in which Mr. Nourse became agent. He was \u201cemployed.\u201d This is a strong expression, and deserves consideration. It carries with it the idea, and almost the essence of a contract. What other more forcible expression would have been used if a contract had been made with any private person? If the secretary had a right to require this duty of Mr. Nourse as register, would he have used the term \u201cemployed\u201d? Would he not rather have said, Mr. Nourse has been required, ordered, directed, or appointed? Suppose Mr. Nourse had refused the agency, would there have been any violation of his official duty? None whatever. Then one of two consequences follows. This burthensome agency, (for that it was onerous and troublesome is proved by the depositions of Mr. Michael Nourse, Mr. Charles J. Nourse, Mr. Rush, Mr. Crawford,. and the certificate of Mr. Wolcott,) was undertaken gratuitously, or compensation was expected. Was it undertaken gratuitously? That it was not is proved by the intended application to congress for compensation, as far back as 1801, as appears by the memorial to congress exhibited in the argument, with Mr. Wolcott\u2019s certificate indorsed. Then it is evident Mr. N. expected compensation, and the then secretary of the treasury was apprised of it. Here was notice that Mr. N. expected compensation; and, of course, he acted neither gratuitously nor under the impression that he was, in executing this agency, discharging any duty belonging to his office of register, but an extra duty for an expected compensation.\nBut it is contended that if Mr. N. is entitled to compensation, it is a right founded upon no law, and dependent entirely upon the will of congress. A right not to be asserted in a court of law, is a solecism. A strange argument has been used to maintain this principle,\u2014that because Mr. Nourse proposed to apply to congress for remuneration, he has acknowledged that he had no legal remedy. How so? Does a man forfeit his right to compensation for services rendered because he has misconceived his remedy? But how did he misconceive his remedy? He could not have sued the government; and therefore had no means to enforce his claim in a court of law. But it is asked, why did he not prefer his accounts to the treasury department at the time he thought of the memorial to congress? Because, in the first place, he might have been, and probably was ignorant of his rights, or apprehended that the secretary of the treasury had no power to allow them; or lie might hare been apprehensive of giving offence to the government, and as he was a removable officer, that he might have endangered his office of register; and. moreover, as he had always large sums of public moneys in his hands, there was, in fact, but little necessity for having the legal point settled at that time. But, for none of these causes can X discern that he has waived or forfeited his right to compensation. Admitting, then, that Mr. Nourse was doubtful, at that period, of his claim to compensation, little doubt exists, at this day. The practice that has uniformly prevailed since, in transactions of this nature, has settled the point. The opinion of Mr. Wirt in Governor Cass\u2019 Case [2 Ops. Attys. Gen. 189], the allowance by Colonel Bomford for extra services of' this sort rendered by army officers; of General Gratiot, by engineer officers, all go to show\u00bb compensation for extra services in disbursing money by officers who receive regular pay as such; and in private transactions compensation by way of commissions to agents receiving and disbursing moneys, is too well settled to be disputed. Then if Mr. Nourse always expected compensation for this extra service, and the government was apprised of it in 1801, (see O. Wolcott\u2019s certificate.) and he has not forfeited it, as I have endeavored to show, by either ignorance of his rights, or by not asserting them sooner, because, having, as 1 observed, already large sums in his hands, and had, until now, no necessity to assert them, I see no reason why he is not entitled now to this compensation; and in this I am supported by Mr. Crawford, late secretary of the treasury: and as two and a half per centum is the rate of allowance established for similar services, (see Bomford and Grat-iot\u2019s certificate,) and has been reported reasonable by the auditors, whose report stands unexcepted to, I am of opinion that the decree of the district judge should be affirmed by this court.\nNOTE. Reversed by the supreme court of the United States (6 Pet. [31 U. S.] 470), on the ground that the United States had no right to appeal from the district to the circuit court; which, in effect, affirmed the judgment of the district court.\n[Subsequently the United States instituted an action of assumpsit upon a transcript from the treasury. The circuit court gave judgment for the defendant, and on error that judgment was affirmed by the supreme court. 9 Pet. (34 U. S.) 8.)\nA strange argument was used to show that Mr. Nourse would have had the same duties to perform as register, had he not acted as agent, as he has had, having acted as such; that he would still have liad the accounts of the agency to register and enter on the books of his office, and so as register he would have had this duty to perform let who will have been agent; and he had all this to do, although he was himself the agent. But, in fact, the concerns of the agency are entirely distinct from and independent of his functions as register. What have contracts for wood, paying superintendents of buildings, watchmen. paying drafts of the library committee for books purchased, paying painters, glaziers. carpenters, bricklayers for work done on the public offices, and the multifarious and innumerable private claims on the contingent fund, and many of these payments, and indeed most of them, not in office hours, drawing cheeks. &c. &c., keeping private books of these transactions, producing vouchers for every, even the smallest payment in settling his accounts, to do with his duties as register of the treasury? Nothing. They are entirely distinct. But Mr. Nourse was \u201cemployed\u201d to do all this; and if he was employed, why should he not be paid? If no special contract was made, then he is entitled, on the principle of a quantum meruit, which creates an implied assumpsit, to pay, on the part of the government, and the quantum of two and a half per cent, is settled by the usage established by other officers of the government in similar cases; by the report of the auditors and by all the analogies to the cases of private agents.\nAs to the statute of limitations; in the first place, it is not pleaded; in the next place, it cannot avail against a party who could not assert his claim by law. Mr. Nourse could not sue the government; therefore could not avoid the operation of the statute. He was obliged' to wait to be sued. Besides, we are bound to decide on principles of justice and equity. The statute, if otherwise available of, seems to be overruled by this directory provision. But the government would be disgraced by pleading the statute of limitations, and if so, we ought not to allow it. Moreover, the policy of the statute, however wise and wholesome as to transactions between private persons, is in nowise applicable to government concerns. The prevention of litigation, the peace and quiet of the community, and the security of the citizens against stale claims, were the objects of the statute; none of which seem at all to bear on the interests or the weal of the government; and therefore the government ought not. and cannot take shelter under it. Again, the United States are not bound by the statute, and it is not right that they should have the benefit of it; the benefit should be reciprocal.\nAs to the want of a replication, it appears, from the record, that a general replication was agreed to be filed, in the judge\u2019s order of the 2d of January, 1831, (see page 7, of the record; see, also, the final decree of the judge,) who says, \u201cThe cause coming on for final decision, on said report, and the bill, answer, replication,\u201d &c., \u201cadmitted by the parties,\u201d so that there appears to have been a replication.\nThe decree of the district court is affirmed."},{"case_name":"Gallego\u2019s Ex\u2019ors v. The Attorney General; Same v. Lambert and Wife and Others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6726328\/","date":"1832-02-01","court":"Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia","content":"CARR, J.\nThis case involves several very important questions, which I shall consider in the order they were discussed at the bar.\nFirst, then, as to the charities. The attorney general filed an information and bill, to have them applied to the objects for which they were bequeathed, and to enforce the execution of the trusts in respect to them; and the chancellor considering them good and valid, decreed them. It was contended in the argument that this decree was erroneous, because the devise and bequests were vague and indefinite, and therefore void. Det us examine this. The pecuniary legacies of 4000 dollars are, in effect, given to the roman catholic congregation, but for the building and support of a chapel; and the ground is given to trustees to permit the roman catholics to build a church on, for the use of themselves, and all persons of that religion, residing in Richmond. The bare statement seems sufficient to shew, that under the general rule, as applicable to ordinary legacies, these would be void. Who are the beneficiaries? the *roman catholic congregation residing in Richmond. And who are they? Suppose you name them to-day: are those the same persons who constituted the congregation yesterday? Or who will constitute it to-morrow? Will none remove from, or come to Richmond, to reside? Will none be converted to or from the roman catholic religion? For it is to the roman catholic congregation for the time being, that the legacies are given. This however is a point which need not be pressed; for it was not pretended, that they could be supported, as legacies to individual persons. But it was strongly insisted,' that as charitable legacies they were entitled to the aid and protection of a court of equity; and the practice of the english courts, irs similar cases, was referred to in proof of the position. The course of decisions in England was admitted on the other side, but it was contended, that they rested in-tirely on the statute of charitable uses, 43 Eli\u00bb, and did not at all belong to the ordinary powers of a court of equity. This was the only serious question. I certainly shall not discuss it; for I find 'this completely done to my hand, by chief justice Marshall, in the case of The Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s ex\u2019ors. The cases cited and examined, and the reasons given by him, prove, conclusively to my mind, that in England, charitable bequests, where no legal interest is vested, and \u25a0 which are too vague to be claimed by those for whom the beneficial interest was intended, cannot be established by a court of equity, either exercising its ordinary jurisdiction, or enforcing the prerogative of the king as parens patriae, independently of the statute 43 Elizabeth; and as that statute, if ever in force here, was repealed in 1792, I conclude that charitable bequests stand on the same footing with us, as all others, and will alike be sustained, or rejected, by courts of equity. X think the bill of the attorney general must be dismissed.\nWc come now to the other questions arising between some of the legatees and the executors. There can be no doubt, that the specific legacies are first to be delivered. *Next in order, are the legacies of 50,000 dollars to the testator\u2019s Spanish relations, 15,000 dollars to P. J. Che-vallie, and the legacies given to the slaves emancipated by the will. The legacies of this class amount to 69,600 dollars. The testator, then, after directing all the residue of his estate to be converted into mcrnej', directs his executors to pay, out of it, his funeral expenses, and their own commission; then, twenty six legacies to as many legatees, amounting to 114,000 dollars, and all legacies which he should bequeath by codicil; and lastly, he creates another residuum, which he bequeaths to residuary legatees. Then come eleven codicils, giving pecuniary legacies to an amount exceeding 47,550 dollars. I think the twenty six legacies bequeathed by the will, out of the first general residue, and the pecuniary legacies bequeathed by the codicils, stand all on the same footing. Erom the passage directing that Mrs. Eisher should be paid her legacy as soon as possible, knowing she was in need, and another in the first codicil, saying that as to the payment of the legacies left by his will, he directs his executors to begin to pay those that they think most in need, and a similar direction as to his brother Erancisco\u2019s legacy, it was contended, that the testator meant to place Mrs. Eisher, and those who should be thought by the executors most needy, .on higher ground than the other legatees, and to authorize the executors to pay them in preference to the others, in case of a deficiency: and this was said to be rendered more clear, by that clause in the fourth codicil, by which he \u201cdesires his executors to use their best judgment in making the sales of his real estate, and not to hurry them, as it might create sacrifices.\u201d But I do not think that the testator ever intended such preference, or dreamed of such deficiency. He believed that the fund would be abundant for all the legacies; and only feared, that to hurry the sales at an unfavourable time might injure his Spanish relations, who were to have the residuum, tie wished this residuum as large as possible, and therefore cautioned the executors; but he never thought about exclusive *preferences among the second class of legatees. The executors however have gone on to pay some of the legatees intirely, others partially; and it is now discovered, that the fund will fall far short of paying all the claims upon it. Jn this state of things, the unsatisfied legatees insist, that the executors are liable to them, for their fair and equal proportion, of the whole fund; while the executors contend, that they must be credited by the full amount of all legacies, or parts of legacies paid, leaving the unpaid legatees to make those who have been overpaid, account to them for the excess. I have the fullest confidence, that the executors have proceeded honestly in this business; but, assuredly, most incautiously. Thejr had the fund in their hands; the will for their guide; and the best counsel at their call: they could have secured themselves, either by paying pari passu, or by taking bonds to refund, or by bringing the whole affair under the control of the chancellor. The legatees could do nothing to prevent improper disbursements: their claim was against the executors alone; and they have made it by suit. Would it not now be most cruel injustice to tell them, the executors, to be sure, ought to have paid you your proportion of the fund; but they have, by mistake, paid it to other legatees; and your only remedy, now, is to seek them over the face of the earth, and call them to account? I can never agree to tell them so. I think it but simple justice to give them a decree against the executors for their fair proportion of the whole fund, and let the executors if they can (a question which I pass by, as it is not before us) recover from the over-paid legatees. It was also contended, that the defect of assets resulting from the general and rapid fall in the value of property, presents a case, where equity will relieve executors from the effects of what the law would call a devastavit: and the cases from 11 Vin. abr. 430, and 1 Chan. Ca. 190, are cited. In one, the property was consumed by the great fire in London; in the other, it was taken away by the restoration: these were cases in which no vigilance or prudence of the executor *could have protected him. But the case before us is different ; safety was perfectly in the executors\u2019 power."},{"case_name":"Commonwealth against Baldwin","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1838036\/","date":"1832-09-01","court":"Supreme Court of Pennsylvania","content":"The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nGibson, C. J.\nIn a monarchy, the exemption of the sovereign from the operation of statutes in which he is not named, is founded in prerogative; and hence it is supposed, that no such exemption can be claimed, for a sovereign constituted of the people in their collective capacity. It is certain, that so much of the prerogative as appertained to the king by virtue of his dignity, is excluded by the nature of our government, which possesses none nf the attributes of royalty; but so much of it as belonged to him in the capacity of parens patriae, or universal trustee, enters as much into our political compact, as it does into the principles of the British constitution. Why should it not do so peculiarly, where the maxim salus- populi is the predominant principle of a government, to whose operations aud well being, the prerogative is as essential as to those of a monarchy ? The necessity of it, in regard to statutes of limitation, is peculiarly apparent. The business of every government is necessarily done by agents, chosen, in-a republic, by the people, it is true, but still no more than agents, and chosen certainly with no greater attention to the qualification of vigilance, than are the agents of an individual, whose utmost care in the choice of them is excited by the interest which he has directly in the event; and the frequency of miscarriage in any business, managed even by these, need not be pointed out. There is a perpetual tendency towards relaxation, where exertion is not invigorated by the stimulus of private gain; and this is the greater where the functions of the officer are to be performed, not under the supervision of an employer immediately concerned, but before the eyes of those who have no other interest in the business, than the remote stake which they have in the public prosperity. To some extent, therefore, and in proportion to the want there happens to be of systematic accountability in the respective departments, remissness of its ministers will be found in every government; and it is a principle, not only of great practical value, but of the first necessity, that the legislature shall not be taken to have postponed a public right to that of an individual, unless such an intent be manifested by explicit terms (as it has been in the order of paying a decedent\u2019s debts), or at least by necessary and irresistible implication. In the United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720, and the United States v. Vanzandt, 11 Wheat. 184, it was ruled that the laches of the public officers, however gross, does not discharge a surety from an official bond; and the principle of these cases was again recognised in Dox v.The Postmaster-General, 1 Peters\u2019s S. C. Rep. 326. In the construction of statutes of limitations, this salutary principle has been retained, I believe, by the courts of all our sister states; at least, I have not found a decision by any of them inconsistent with it, whil\u00e9 by many it has been distinctly asserted. It was thus held in Weatherhead v. Bledsoe, 2 Tennessee Rep. 352. In Kentucky, the distinction which I have intimated, has been taken between the prerogative which relates to the government, and that which relates to the person of the king; by reason of which, the state was held not to be barred in a personal action by a statute in which it was not named. Commonwealth v. M\u2019Gowan, 4 Bibb 62. In the case of Nimmo v. The Commonwealth, 4 Hen. & Munf. 57, it is said that the English maxim nullum tempus, has been .adopted in Virginia; and that statutes of limitations do not extend to the commonwealth, in civil suits, not founded on any penal act in which the commencement of the action is expressly limited ; on which principle it was determined, that no length of-time bars the commonwealth from having execution of a judgment, or subjects her to the necessity of suing out a scire facias. The same principle ruled the cause in Kemp v. The Commonwealth, 1 Hen. Munf. 85, which was the case of a personal demand prosecuted by motion\u2014a mode peculiar to Virginia ; and there are, I believe, other decisions to the same effect in that state. In Maryland, the doctrine is distinctly asserted, in Cheny v. Ringgold, 2 Harris & J. 87; Hall v. Gittings, 2 Harris & J. 112; Stewart v. Mason, 3 Harris & J. 531, and perhaps some other cases : as it is in New York, in The People v. Gilbert, 18 Johns. 227, and Wilcox qui tam v. Filch, 20 Johns. 422. In Stoughton v. Barker, 4 Mass. 428, Chief Justice Parsons, and all the judges of the supreme court of Massachusetts held, that a condition or limitation for the benefit of the public is not extinguished by any inattention or neglect, in respect of compelling the owner to comply with it. There may be decisions to the same effect in other states, which have escaped my research ; but those already cited would be entitled not merely to respect, but a commanding influence, even were the question in Pennsylvania an open one. We have, however, but a single case, in which the naked point was directly presented ftir adjudication. The public lands have been open to entry for the purpose of settlement; and the possession of the seller indicating his assent to become purchaser of the title on the terms held out, has been under, instead of being adverse to the commonwealth. Hence it might seem, from a cursory view of Morris v. Thomas, 5 Binn. 77, and M\u2019Coy v. Dickinson College, 4 Serg. & Rawle 302, that those cases were thus determined, not because there was no statute to bar the commonwealth, but because there was no adverse possession. But in Bagley v. Wallace; 16 Serg. & Rawle 245, the maxim was applied to lands on which the entry of the defendant was an unequivocal trespass, and the exemption of the commonwealth put expressly on the ground of her prerogative as a sovereign. And the same principle seems to have been held in. The Commonwealth v. McDonald, 16 Serg. & Rawle 400, where it was determined that the adverse possession of part of a street, for twenty years, which, in analogy to the statute of limitations, bars the franchise of an individual, did not bar the public right of way, and, undoubtedly, because there is no statute to bar the public in any case, from which an analogy could be drawn. Without, then, pretending to fix its limits, in all cases, it may be safely asserted that this prerogative is a principle of our government, and a part of the law of the land.\nAs to the remaining points, it is not to be doubted that, though this suit is in the name of the treasurer, the commonwealth is the actual party, and entitled to insist on her prerogative. The treasurer is but a trustee to her use : and the nature of the judgment in her favour presents a question of no greater difficulty. It was for a sum certain, in the first instance, and consequently final. This feature was wanting in the Philadelphia Bank v. Craft, 16 Serg. & Rawle 347, in which the judgment was rendered not even for a nominal sum. The law of the subject is satisfactorily stated in Lewis v. Smith, 2 Serg. & Rawle 155, where it was determined, that if on a confession of judgment, the demand is in the nature of a debt which may be ascertained by calculation, it is sufficient to enter judgment generally, which, in contemplation of law, is for the amount laid. Here the action being in debt at the common law, was for a specific sum j and even if a declaration were not filed, the judgment would be rendered certain by relation to the writ. Were it otherwise, every judgment by default, in an action of debt for a penalty which is never the real debt, would be treated as interlocutory; yet, I believe it has never been doubted, that such a judgment binds the lands of the debtor, even though it were a part of the terms that all payments made were to be allowed by the prothonotary.\nRogers, J. and Ross, J. took no part in the judgment, being stockholders in the bank.\nThe plaintiff had leave to take the amount of the judgment out of court."},{"case_name":"MAGILL v. BROWN","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6611472\/","date":"1833-04-01","court":"United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania","content":"BALDWIN, Circuit Justice.\nThis case arises on the will of Sarah Zane, a member of the Society of Friends, who in the body thereof describes herself as of the city of Philadelphia. She died in Virginia, but, as it has not been questioned, we shall assume this to have been the place of her domicil at the time of her death. The law of the state must therefore govern her disposition of her personal property, as well as of her real estate situated here. 1 Bin. 336, 344; 3 Rawle, 318; 3 Pen. & W. 187, 188.\nThe questions which have been made in the argument, and those which necessarily arise in the case, are of the most interesting kind; involving the capacity of the Quaker societies of this and other states to take real or personal estate by devise, without a charter of incorporation; their right to enjoy it for their own use, as a body united for the purposes of religion, charity, and education; and what now are, by.the law of the land, pious and charitable uses, for which valid donations can be made by deed or will. In referring to the history of the settlement of this state, the principles of its first settlers, the character of its founder, his systems and institutions, it would seem not a little surprising that such questions could have remained open till this time. If there are any subjects on which the law could be supposed to be settled, it would be the rights of religious societies and charitable establishments. If there was any part of the law of England which could be congenial to the spirit and policy of the colony, and likely to be adopted by a society of men who sought an asylum from persecution for religious opinion, it would be that which would afford the best protection in the enjoyment of their rights, privileges, immunities and estates as a religious society. If there were any laws which they would be disposed to leave behind them, they would be those which grew out of feudal tenures, a spirit of persecution, or an established religion. The last laws which they would introduce would be those which created a forfeiture of all land conveyed to a society incorporated for the purposes of charity and religious worship, according to their own consciences, without regard to the mode of celebrating divine service as prescribed by law, or which prevent a donation for such uses from taking effect without a special license by charter or act of assembly. Such would be the natural conclusion from the known and practical principles of civil and religious liberty which have distinguished the policy and jurisprudence of this state through all time as founded on a system of \u201cfree and unlimited Catholicism\u201d in matters of religion, of expanded benevolence in matters of charity, and equality of rights in the enjoyment of property.\nThese leading features are so strongly impressed on the written laws, and enter so deeply into the customs and common law of the state, as to make it impossible to mistake the character and tendency of the system in the details of its legislation, by \u2019 colonial authority, or the adoptiop of the statutes or common law of England. It is not conceivable that the Quaker settlers of this province should have introduced those laws of the mother country, which would incapacitate them as individuals or a religious society from taking, holding or enjoying property as a matter of right without a charter; or expose to a forfeiture to the proprietor or mesne landlord lands conveyed to them for the purposes of sepulture, religious worship, or charity; and above all that William Penn should have adopted the statutes of Henry VIII., declaring the celebration of divine service according to the rites of the Catholic church to be superstitious, and conveyances for its use illegal and void; and the statutes of mortmain, which make the enjoyment of property by a religious body dependent on the pleasure and permission of the lord of the fee; while at the same time he excludes the statute of 43 Eliz. and the mild and beneficent principles of the common law which that statute has been held to have restored.\nThe history of the Society of Quakers presents no instance of an incorporation. Did they adopt any rule of law, making one necessary to give them a legal capacity to purchase property? They have enjoyed it from the earliest time without a license in mort-main. Is it liable to be now seized by the state as forfeited by the purchaser? They have their own modes of worship and system of charities. Are donations for their support to be regulated by the prohibitory statutes of a foreign country, or confined to the uses specified in its laws? 2 Ves. Sr. 475. They have kindred societies in other states \u2014 do the laws of these invalidate a bequest of money to them for purposes of piety and charity? These are questions which have been made by the counsel in their objections to the devise of the lot of ground to the yearly meeting of Philadelphia, and the pecuniary bequests to the several meetings of Friends in this place and in Maryland. Virginia, and Ohio. The objections to the validity of the dispositions of this will are not founded on any statutory law of Pennsylvania, but on the English statutes of mortmain, superstitious uses, and wills, alleged to be in force in this state by usage, though not adopted by any act of assembly. The principles of the common law have also been relied on as supporting the objection-to the capacity of the parties to take, for the want of an incorporation as well as of an act of assembly, containing enabling provisions, analagous to the 43 Eliz., validating dispositions for religious, literary and charitable purposes, and giving jurisdiction to the courts to carry them into effect, as they can do in England.\nThe field of investigation is from its nature a broad one, and from the confined course which has been taken in discussing the law of charities in the various cases which have arisen is, in a great measure, a new one. Though there are several statutes on the subject in England, prior to the 43 Eliz., no treatise or opinion contains a condensed or comparative view of the system of charities, which has grown out of them, so as to enable us by any authority of precedent or adjudication to ascertain the definite source of the various principles which have from time to time become embodied into the general course of the law of England. Nor have the courts of the United States or of this state brought into contrast or comparison either the policy of the government of England and this country in relation to the religious establishments and rights of conscience, the general course of legislation pursued in either, or the principles of the common law independent of the statutes alluded to.\nProceeding on the assumption that the 43 Eliz. was the only foundation on which charities could be supported, in opposition to prior statutes, and that statute not being considered in force here unless re-enacted, the courts in this country have laid down principles which, resting solely on such assumption, cannot be considered as authoritative in their conclusions, if on a more thorough examination the premises on which they depend should appear to be erroneous. We trust that a review of the course of their adjudication on charities will show that it has not become so settled as to be sanctioned by the maxim of \u201ccommunis error facit jus,\u201d or that in endeavoring to extract the rules which must govern the law of charities from the constitution of the Union and this state, its statutes and usages, and the statutes and common law of England, we violate the respect due to the decisions of courts of high authority.\nIt is at all times proper to discriminate between the question directly presented for the deliberate consideration of a court, on which they exercise their judgment, by a solemn adjudication, and those observations which are made by way of illustration, or mere declarations of what the law is on any particular subject. The one is binding as authority, the other to be respected only as a mere opinion or argument, which must have its influence, but cannot be enforced on our judgment. If the supreme judicial tribunal of the state or the Union have judicially considered the statutes of mortmain to be in force, this court is bound to take the law as settled; but if they have merely declared them to be so, without making such opinion the basis of their judgment, or have in doing so omitted to refer to the supreme law of the land which bears on the question, this court may and ought to do what a higher one would do, notwithstanding any preconceived or expressed opinion \u2014 compare the constitution with the statutes, and be governed by the result\nThe 3d section of the 3d article of the constitution of the United States prohibits. a \u201cforfeiture for treason except during the life of the person attainted.\u201d The constitution of Pennsylvania extends the prohibition to all forfeitures by attainder, or felos de se, or death by casualties. It is at least worth the inquiry whether a forfeiture in fee is incurred by an alienation in mortmain, against which no prohibition is to be found in any law of the state; in a word, whether a penal law of England has an effect which the whole power of the federal and state government is incompetent to give to a conviction for the highest crimes known to their laws. 9 Serg. & R. 343. This inquiry necessarily leads to an investigation of the common law, so as to find out whether these statutes are in affirmance or derogatory of its principles which have been made the common law of the state, so far as adopted or applicable to its policy. If they are of the latter character, then how have they become in force in Pennsylvania, and what is the evidence of their adoption by legislation or usage? As these statutes impose a forfeiture of the whole estate conveyed, the proposition that they are in force here ought to be considered as an affirmative one to be made out by those who assent, that an act lawful by the common law is prohibited by a statute. The penal laws of England have been presumed not to be in force here. The burden of proof has always been held to be on those who allege a forfeiture, by an act punishable only by statute; and it ought to be clear and conclusive, especially on subjects which affect the rights to the transmission and enjoyment of property. If there was any one subject on which the founder, the legislature, and the people of the colony, from its flrst settlement, were governed by a settled, unyielding course of policy, it was to facilitate the transmission of estates, to secure their enjoyment, and disincumber them of all restraints attendant on feudal tenures, the forms of conveyance, the ceremonies of investiture, and most emphatically to protect them from the operation of all laws growing out of an established religion, which at all interfered with the rights of conscience or the perfect freedom of religious worship. Lyle v. Richards, 9 Serg. & R. 326, 334, 359.\nThe charter of privileges of 1701, the colonial laws, both the constitutions of 1776 and 1790, and the laws of the state, are in the same spirit which induced the people, in their flrst acts of assuming independence and establishing government by their own authority, to prescribe the following oath to the members of the convention who formed their first constitution: \u201cThat I will oppose any measure that shall or may in the least interfere with or obstruct the religious principle or practice of any of the good people of this province, as heretofore enjoyed.\u201d Conv. Pa. 39. The constitution was in the spirit of this oath, and declared the rights of religious societies and corporate bodies held according to the usage of the colony to be inviolable. We have, therefore, a plain rule of decision by the supreme law of the state, if the nature and extent of such usage can be judicially ascertained. The enjoyment of real estate in perpetuity by any body incorporated by a written charter, or one presumed by law from evidence of long possession and exercise of corporate franchises, is mortmain per se. If on a review of the legislation and custom of the colony before* and of the state after the Revolution, it shall appear, that their rights have been the subject of the most continued favor, and their protection is provided for in the most explicit manner, it must be deemed conclusive evidence of the general policy of the state at least, if it does not establish the utter incompatibility of any incapacity in any body of men not only to take, but to enjoy, an estate to their own use, with the whole scope and tenor both of its written and common law.\nThe strong constitutional position which has been assumed by the senior counsel of the respondent in this case has induced us to examine it with a degree of attention equally called for by the magnitude of the questions involved, and by the conclusions which we have felt ourselves bound to adopt; in some respects at variance with the views of the judges of the supreme court of the United States as to the necessity of an actual incorporation to give the capacity to take; and of those of this state, to enable a corporation to enjoy an estate. We think, however, that it will be found to accord with all the great leading principles and rales which have been too firmly established by themselves to be now shaken, and that their minds would have come to the same conclusion as ours have done if the same materials for investigation had been presented, to them. In reviewing the judicial history of this state, it is believed that there will be found no decision that an incorporation is necessary to give to any association of individuals the capacity of taking and enjoying an estate in perpetuity, either by the assumed name of the society, or by trustees for their use. If such a rule exists, it is only by the common law as adopted liere. Neither is there any adjudged case turning on the statutes of mortmain, hy which any estate has ever been vested in the commonwealth by a forfeiture incurred in consequence of an alienation to a corporate body without license, charter or law; or any evidence that such license was ever granted by the proprietary or governor, or any public grant made with a clause of non obstante statuto, in any patent, charter, or act of assembly, under the colonial or state government; nor does the word \u201cmortmain\u201d appear on the statute book for one hundred and fifty years from the date of the charter to Penn. This unbroken silence would have been taken as conclusive evidence that the British statutes were deemed wholly inapplicable to the fixed policy of the colony and state, its usage and fundamental laws, if the contrary opinion had not been expressed by the judges of the supreme court of the state, and adopted by the legislature at the present session. Hence arises the importance, as well as delicacy, of the questions involved in this cause. To consider them open after the declared opinion of both departments of the government, may seem to indicate a want of respect to their authority, but when we feel convinced that there is a law of higher obligation which must guide our judgment, we are bound to follow it.\nThe view which we feel constrained to take of the constitutions of 1701, 1770. and 1790. all of which remain in force so far as respects the rights of property, conscience, and religious worship, is this: that all bodies united for religious, charitable or literary purposes, though without a written charter or law, are to be considered as corporations by prescription or the usage and common law of the state, with all the attributes and incidents of such corporations by the principles of the common law. and entitled to all rights which are conformable to the customs of the province. From this view it results that if the statutes of mortmain apply to bodies whose charters are in existence they apply equally to those whose charters are presumed from prescription. A brief summary of these jn-o-visions will show that- they embrace all corporations of either kind. The 9 Hen. III. c. 36, declared gifts made to any religious house to be void, and that the land given should enure to the lord of the fee. The 7 Edw. I. prohibited all alienations in mortmain under a like forfeiture. These statutes were evaded by fictitious recoveries, till the 13 Edw. I. took away their effect. A new inode of evasion was then invented by conveyances in trust for uses in mortmain, so that the profits went to religious persons. The 15 Rich. II. extended the former statutes to such uses, and to all guilds, fraternities, towns, and cities which have perpetual community, and all others which have offices perpetual, though not people of religion. Keb. St. 5, 33, 46. 181; 1 Ruffh. St. 9, 32. 100, 401, 402. The 23 Hen. VIII. c. 10, prohibited conveyances to any bodies not incorporated, for the use of churches, &c., to have obits perpetual or the continual service of a priest forever, and declared them void, but there was au express saving of the right of devising in mort-main by the custom of cities and towns corporate. Keb. St. 403, 404; 2 Ruffh. St. 171, 172. The statute of wills of 34 & 35 Hen. VIII. contained an express exception of devices to corporations. Keb. St. 562; Ruffh. St. 333, 334.\nSuch is the substance of the English statutes, which have been considered as the clogs upon dispositions to pious and charitable uses, which have been removed by the 43 Eliz. in England. If the question of their application to the state of things in this colony was a new one, we should deem it apparent that they were never practically extended to it. \u201cIt is the true principle of colonization that the emigrants from the mother country carry with them such laws as are useful in their new situation, and none other.\u201d 3 Bin. 596. That the law of charities as it rests on the 43 Eliz. is not only useful, but peculiar^' adapted to the policy of the state, is unquestioned. It is therefore difficult to account for tlie prevalence of the opinion that it is not in force, or that any statutes repugnant to its provisions, should have been considered as practically adopted. Vet such is undoubtedly the apparent tendency of judicial opinion for the last twenty-five years.\nIn 180S, the judges of the supreme court made a report to the legislature pursuant to a resolution calling on them to state what English statutes were in force, in which they declare \u201cconveyances to superstitious uses absolutely void by these statutes, and conveyances to corporations, unless sanctioned by charter or act of assembly, to be so far void that they have no capacity to hold the estates for their own benefit, but subject to the right of the commonwealth, who may appropriate them at their own pleasure; in other words, that such conveyances have no validity for the purpose of enabling the corporation to hold in mortmain.\u201d They consider them as standing on the same footing as conveyances to aliens. 3 Bin. 626; Leazure v. Hillegas. 7 Serg. & R. 319. 322. In M\u2019Girr v. Aaron they declared a devise to an officiating priest and his successors, not being a corporation sole, was against the policy of the law. and void, as tending to a perpetuity. 1 Pen. & W. 51. In the case of Methodist Church v. Remington. 1 Watts. 218, they say: \u201cThe statutes of mortmain, too, which deprive corporations of the capacity to hold,\u201d &c., and consider the legislature as evincing \u201can evident jealousy of clerical monopoly,\u201d though they refer to no act in which it had been expressed. They also decided, that a conveyance for a religious society composed of members a majority of whom resided out of the state was not good under the law of 1730; and that the trust not being sanctioned by any legislative recognition, they would not lend their aid to carry it into effect. In Witman v. Lex they seem to take for granted that at common law an incorporation was necessary to give a capacity to take and hold in perpetuity (17 Serg. & R. 91), though it was dispensed with by the custom of the province. We should have felt bound by these opinions, if the court had taken a view of the constitution and legislation of the state on the subjects to which they relate, and given them a deliberate construction; but as they have not been called upon to declare the meaning of any but the act of 1780, or of the provisions of any of the constitutions, it cannot be expected that the law can be considered as settled until their provisions had been brought under judicial notice. In the case of Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 28, the supreme court of the United States have decided that a bequest of personal property to the plaintiffs as trustees was not valid for want of an incorporation, at the time of the devise; and the decision was approved in the case of Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor, 3 Pet [28 U. S.] 114. This case was ruled according to the law of Virginia, in which state the 43 Eliz. had been repealed. We may therefore consider it as a case settling a question of a local rather than of a general nature. It has not, at any rate, such an application to the law of Pennsylvania as to control this case, if it should appear to be embraced in the provisions of any act of assembly or constitution of the state, or to rest on its known and recognized usage.\nSo far as these opinions of both courts rest on general principles affecting this case, they are also open to all rules which have been laid down in other cases by the same authority. to which it is thought best to refer before entering on a review of the general course of the law of England or of this state. The last case which has arisen in the supreme court of the state is Methodist Church v. Remington [supra]. In giving their opinion, the chief justice uses this strong language: \u201cThe decision in Witman v. Lex is full to the point that a trust in favor of an incorporated religious or charitable society is an available one.\u201d As the statute 15 Rich. II. expressly applied to conveyances in trust, or for the use of religious persons, in mortmain, we may consider this statute as not in force in this state; so that the objections growing out of the statutes of mortmain will be confined to those of Hen. III. and Edw. I. In relation to superstitious uses, the court observe: \u201cThe present is not a superstitious use, and indeed it is not easy to see how there can be such a thing here, at least in the acceptation of the word by the British courts, who seem to have extended it to all uses which are not subordinate to the interest and will of the established church;\u201d so that an inquiry into this subject is not closed. In M\u2019Girr v. Aaron there were no trustees, and, though the court held the devise to an officiating priest void because he was not a corporation, yet they declared it good in ease of the congregation, though not incorporated (1 Pen. & W. 51, 52), on the principle that \u201ca gift to a charitable use shall not fail for want of a trustee, but vest as soon as the charity has acquired a capacity to take.\u201d As the bequest in the case of the Baptist Association failed only for the want of a trustee capable at the time of the devise, though\u2019 there was an incorporation afterwards, we cannot consider it as authority in this state, where a different principle is established. The bequest would have been good according to M\u2019Girr v. Aaron.\nIn examining the decisions of the supreme court of the United States which precede and follow the Baptist Case, it appears that they have established a different principle as to devises of real estate for charitable uses, or for the use of religious societies which are not incorporated; so as to leave that case applicable only to a bequest of money or personal property, even in Virginia. In Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 43, 53, land in or near Alexandria was conveyed to two persons, the church-wardens of the parish for the time being, and their successors in office for the use and benefit of the church in said parish. The deed was held to operate by way of estoppel to confirm to the church and its privies the perpetual and beneficial estate in the land, though it was not incorporated, and church-wardens were not capable of holding an inheritance in land by succession. [Mason v. Muncaster] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 455, 464. The court remark: \u201cAnd in our judgment it would make no difference whether the Episcopal Church were a voluntary society or clothed with corporate powers, for in equity, as to objects which the laws cannot but recognise as useful and meritorious, the same reason would exist for relief in the one case as the other. Laws enacted for religious purposes evidently presuppose the existence of the Episcopal Church, with its general rights and authorities growing out of the common law.\u201d The church was capable of receiving endowments of land, and that the minister of the parish was during the incumbency seized of the freehold of its inheritable property as emphatically persona eeele-siae, and capable as a sole corporation of transmitting the inheritance to his successors. [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 45, 46, 329; [Mason v. Muncaster] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 455, 464. In Town of Paulet v. Clark, 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 329, they say: \u201cThe property was in fact and in law generally purchased by the parishioners, or acquired by the benefactions of pious donors. The title thereto was indefeasibly vested in the churches, or rather in their legal agents \u2014 [Terrett v. Taylor] Id. 49 \u2014 or representatives entitled to take the donation \u2014 [Town of Paulet v. Clark] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 329.\u201d \u201cThe true legal notion of a parish church is a conse crated place, having attached to it the right of burial, and the administration of the sacra- meats. Every such church, of common right, 'ought to have manse and glebe as a suitable endowment; and when there is a church actually in existence, a grant to it is in effect a grant to the parson and his successors, as an endowment to be held jure eeclesiae.\u201d [Town of Paulet v. Clark] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 329; [Mason v. Muncaster] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 464. The parsou has a qualified fee, but the land becomes the perpetual inheritance of the church. [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 47, 53; [Town of Paulet v. Clark] Id. 329; Co. Lift. 341 a. b.; 2 Mass. 500.\nIn Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 580, 583, 585, the court decided that the laying out and marking a lot in the plan of a town \u201cfor the Lutheran Church\u201d was a good and valid disposition \u2014 though it was not then organized, and was never incorporated as a religious society, but was a voluntary association, acting in its general arrangement by committees and trustees chosen from time to time; or any church actually in existence, or any grantee capable of taking. It was supported as a dedication of the lot to public and pious uses, and the enjoyment decreed to the committee of the society. The court take a ground which applies with great force to the law and constitution of Pennsylvania, as will appear hereafter. \u201cThe bill of rights of Maryland gives validity to any sale, gift, lease or devise of any quantity of land, not exceeding two acres, for a church, meeting, or other house of worship, and for a burying ground, which shall be used, improved and enjoyed only for such purposes. To this extent it recognizes the doctrines of the statute of Elizabeth for charitable uses, under which, it is well known, that such uses would be upheld, although there was no specific trustee or grantee.\u201d In the Case of the Town of Paulet they laid down the principle that they considered appropriations or dedications of property to particular or religious uses as an exception to the general rule, requiring a particular grantee, and, like the dedication of a highway to the public. [Town of Paulet v. Clark] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 331; s. p. [Beatty v. Kurtz] 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 583. In M\u2019Connell v. Lexington, 12 Wheat. [25 U. S.] 582, they considered that the immemorial use of a spring by the people of the town, as public property, was evidence of its original dedication, and decisive against a private claim to its exclusive use. In Cincinnati v. White, 6 Pet. [31 U. S.] 436. 437, the principle of these cases was affirmed to its fullest extent, and the court add \u2014 what is very important in the consideration of this case \u2014 that \u201cthe ease of Beatty v. Kurtz [supra] did not turn on the bill of rights of Maryland or the statute of Elizabeth, but rested on more general principles of law.\u201d [Cincinnati v. White, supra.]\nTo trace these principles to their source in the early statutes and common law of England is therefore in perfect accordance with the decisions of the tribunal to whose revision our opinion is subject. It is the more necessary in this case, as the general course of the law of England as to the transmission and enjoyment of property formed the law of the colony at its first settlement, and continued in force till repealed or altered by colonial authority. In ascertaining what these general principles are, it is our duty to adopt the rules of construction which have been established by the supreme court in relation to charities under the 43 Eliz., and to apply them to the laws and constitution of this state, and the other English statutes which are analogous in their provisions and subject-matter to that statute, in doing which we shall start upon premises which must lead to correct results.\nThe legislation of Pennsylvania will be first considered according to the rules of expounding statutes laid down in Baptist Association v. Hart [4 Wheat. (17 U. S.) 1], and those which are the principles of the common law. It is not to be denied that if any gifts are enumerated in this statute which were not previously valid, or for which no previous remedy existed, the statute makes them valid, and furnishes a remedy. That there were such gifts, and that the statute has given them validity, has been repeatedly determined. The books are full of cases where conveyances to charitable uses which were void by the statutes of mortmain, or were in other respects so defective that on general principles nothing passed, have been sustained under this statute. If this statute restores to its original capacity a conveyance rendered void by an act of the legislature, it will, of course, operate with equal effect on any legal objection to the gift which originates in any other manner, and which a statute can remove. The authorities to this point are numerous. [Baptist Ass\u2019n v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 31; 1 Sugd. Powers, 267; 4 Vin. Abr. 479, 483; Gilb. Ch. 45; 1 P. Wms. 248; [Inglis v.

The duty of judges is to advance the remedy and suppress the mischief \u2014 to advance the public and suppress the private object. 11 Coke, 70-73b; Hob. 97, 157; 5 Coke, 14b. Statutes authorizing gifts in mortmain, and all laws in favor of public institutions, shall be favorably and benignly construed. 11 Coke, 76a; Hob. 122; Co. Litt. 99a; [Town of Paulet v.

And in all acts for the confirmation of grants by persons having power over the land the deed shall be established though it wants some circumstance necessary to gire it effect, according to its tenor and purport. 11 Coke, 78a. The statutes of superstition were intended to advance and continue good and charitable uses, and affect none which are not derived out of superstitious uses, or to be distributed by superstitious persons. Moore, 129, pl. 277; 4 Coke, 105, 11, 13, 14; where the same deed contains a disposition partly superstitious, and pious and charitable in other parts, the latter are good, if not dependent on and capable of being separated from the former. 4 Coke, 104\u2014116, and cases cited; Anders. 95-100; Cro. Eliz. 449; Wing. Max. 497; Co. Litt. 342a. Though hospitals are named in the statutes, they apply only to such as are religious or ecclesiastical, or the funds are to be devoted to purposes of superstition as specially defined and plainly prohibited. It shall not be made superstitious by construction or intendment \u2014 it must be plain, and not imaginary, and no general words shall take away good and charitable gifts allowed by parliament, which are favored in the law. Co. Litt. 342a; Hob. 120-124; Moore, 865, pl. 1194; 11 Coke, 70b 71a; Wing. Max. 497. An affirmative statute does not take away a right existing by common law or custom, as the statute of wills, which did not affect the previous right to devise. Co. Litt. 111b, 115a; 3 Coke, 35a.\nA custom saved and preserved by a statute is. good against a statute. Thus lands can be held in mortmain in London without license, because there is such a custom (Cro. Eliz. 455); and the customs of London are saved by acts of parliament and Magna Charta (2 Co. Inst. 201; 4 Co. Inst 250, 253; 5 Day, Com. Dig. 20; Cro. Eliz. 248, 455; W. Jones, 251, 387). A statute authorizing an act to be done repeals a law prohibiting it; otherwise it would be a dead letter, in opposition to an established maxim that such construction shall be made of all acts, \u201cut res magis valeat, quam pereat,\u201d and reverse another unquestioned one, \u201cleges posteriores priores contraria abrogant.\u201d [Greene v. Neal] 6 Pet. [31 U. S.] 299. A grant by the king or an act of parliament is an authority to hold the thing granted, and operates as a license dispensing with the performance of any other act required by any law against which the king may grant a license or dispensation; though none is given in terms, it per se creates an incorporation, confers suggestion, and grants a rent; so if done by a private person under the authority of an act of parliament, as the erection of an hospital. 10 Coke, 30, 25a; Plowd. 502. A clause of non obstante statuto is not necessary to save a forfeiture by the statutes of mortmain. It is inferred from the act of the king or the legislature in order to give it effect. 8 Coke, 56. Its only use is to show the king is not deceived. 4 Coke, 36a. Hence it has always been held that the statutes did not apply to grants made by the king. 15 Vin. Abr. 479, a, 2. \u201cHe shall not be intended to be misconusant, and when he licenses expressly to alien to an abbot, &c., which is in mortmain, he need not make any non obstante of the statute of mortmain, for it is apparent to be granted in mortmain, the license of the king or mediate lords operates to two intents, as a dispensation from the statute of quia emptores, and of mort-main, because their deeds shall be taken most strongly against them, and the king shall not be presumed to make a void grant.\u201d Co. Litt. 98b, 99a; Plowd. 502; 8 Coke, 56.\nWhere land is held immediately of the king, he may grant a license to alien in mortmain; if held mediately, it might be made by the mesne lord, or with his consent. 34 Edw. I. c. 3; Keb. St. 71; Ruffh. St. 155. Since the 7 & 8 Wm. III., he can do it without their consent. 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 298. As tenures in chivalry had been abolished by the statute 12 Car. H., the forfeiture accruing by alienation in mortmain accrued only to the king, who may renounce by his license a right conferred on the crown. Co. Litt. 98, 99; Vaughan, 332. The effect of a license in mortmain is not to give a capacity to a corporation to take or hold in mortmain. Conveyances in mort-main were good at common law. Co. Litt. 98, 99; Vaughan, 356. A grant in frank-almoigne placed the lands in the hands of bodies which never died. The estate became dead as to the king or mesne lords, of whom they were holden, yielding neither escheats, wardships, reliefs, or other benefits. Such grants were always good by deeds of private persons before the statutes, or by title of prescription, and are now good by the grant of the king. Litt. \u00a7\u00a7 141, 142; Co. Litt. 98, 99; Co. Litt. 2b; Terms of the Law, 294; Plowd. 293; 6 Coke, 17a. Notwithstanding the statutes, the estate vests by the conveyance. 7 Serg. & R. 320. They are founded on the capacity of the grantee to take, so that wherever they apply the conveyance would enable a corporation to hold at common law for its own use; for if the estate did not vest, it would remain in the hands of the grantor or his heirs, as in the case of a conveyance to superstitious uses, which are merely void without incurring any forfeiture by the statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI. The license therefore is only an exemption from the penalty of the statutes. Co. Litt. 52b. It restores an interest. 1 Freem. 117. It is an authority coupled with an interest, enabling the grantees to acquire and enjoy an inheritance to their own use, without incurring the forfeiture, and by a renunciation of the rights given by the statutes, leaves the estate in their hands as if they had never been passed (2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 297, b, 3; Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 222, 495, 500; 4 Co. Inst. 135; Co. Litt. 99a; Vaughan, 333, 356); and operates in favor of a society or body not incorporated by a charter (Vaughan, 351, 352; 7 Coke, 35b). which is conclusive to show its previous capacity to take. All that can be required, then, to irire the same capacity to bold as to take, and make the right to enjoy as perfect as to take an estate, is any act of the party to whom the forfeiture accrues, which is in terms, or by its legal operation, a renunciation of a right conferred by law, which binds him and protects the estate from the assertion of his claim under the statutes; according to the established principle that subsequent laws abrogate prior ones, inconsistent with them, -without any repealing clause, and will produce the same effect as a license in mortmain. It is admitted that the king is bound by all acts of parliament in which he is named, so that he can exercise no power by statute; prerogative, or tenure, in derogation of any right protected or authority conferred by the statute; but, generally speaking, he is not bound unless its provisions extend to him. subject to these exceptions. All statutes which provide profitable remedy for the maintenance of religion. the advancement of good literature, and the relief of the poor (11 Coke, 71b; 5 Coke, 14a. 14b). which suppress wrong and provide a remedy for a right (2 Co. Inst. 142. 69. 359, 681), or tend to perform the will of a donor or founder (11 Coke. 72a; 5 Coke. 14. 15; Plowd. 246; 3 Atk. 147), bind the king, though not named. His claims to lands by escheat, forfeiture or wardship are subject to all rights existing before they came to his hands. The law gives him a better remedy, but no better right, than the subject from whom the land came to his hands (2 Co. Inst. 573; 2 Ves. Sr. 290. 297; Hardr. 69. 469); and the appropriate courts were authorized by the statute \u2014 33 Hen. VIII. c. 39; Keb. St. 555: 2 Ruffh. St. 324 \u2014to decide on the rights of a subject, in a controversy between him and the king, according to equity and good conscience, as between subject and subject (7 Coke. 19b; Hardr. 27. 176. 230. 502; 4 Co. Inst. 190).\nThese are the principles which have given to the 43 Eliz. its powerful effect; though it contains no repealing clause, license or non obstante statuto. yet. by universal consent, it has been held to repeal the statutes of mortmain, the exceptions of corporations in the statute of wills, and to restore the common law in all eases embraced in its provisions. or which can be brought within them by the most liberal and benign construction. 1 P. Wms. 248; Finch, Prec. 16; Gilb. Eq. 137; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 191; [Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor] 3 Pet. [28 U. S.) 141. These principles are admirably condensed by the supreme court in [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 31, and are those by which we must consider the legislation of Pennsylvania on the same subjects. We must hold its law to bind the state, and to dispense with the forfeiture accruing to it by an alienation in mortmain, if a similar law in England would bind the king. The prerogative of a republican state cannot be deemed, in a court of justice, more sacred than the jewels of a crown; or the rights of its citizens, individually or collectively, to the enjoyment of property, to be placed on a less permanent foundation than those of the subjects of a monarchy. Nor can corporations be subject to disabilities here from which they are exempted by the general course of the law of England, between the spirit and policy of which, and that of Pennsylvania, there will be found a most marked difference in this respect.\nIn England there has always been a jealousy of their rights to hold property; here they will be found to have been favored and protected by express provisions ,in the constitution and laws, while there is an entire absence of any restriction on their capacity to take or enjoy estates. There the effect of statutes has been to remove disabilities interposed by former statutes, which abrogated common law rights; here laws have been passed in affirmance of its principles, and they have been embodied in a supreme law. There courts have gone to the extent of their power, to rescue charities from the intolerant spirit of the times; here their duty is to further the benevolent policy of the people and legislature as evidenced in all their acts. From the first settlement of the province, we find that the uniform tenor of its laws has been to encourage all alienations of property, and to confirm its disposition, in every mode known to the law. The act of 1705 confirmed all sales of land made under the laws of the province, and declared that no deed, grant or assurance should be held defective on account, of any want of form, of livery of seisin, attornment, misnomer or misrecital, but shall be good and effectual. 1 Dall. Laws, 51, 53; 1 Smith Laws, 31. This law has always been in force. The act of 1711 confirmed all grants from the proprietor to any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, to hold the same for such estates and uses as they had been sold or disposed of, notwithstanding any defects therein, and shall be expounded most beneficially for the grantees, according to the words, tenor and true meaning thereof. 1 Dall. Laws, Append. 39, 40. This law was repealed in council in 1713. but its principles have ever been respected. The law of 1705 declared that all wills whereby any lands were devised should be good and available in law for granting, conveying, and assuring the lands devised and chattels bequeathed. 1 Dall. Laws, 53; 1 Smith, Laws, 33; 1 Dall. Laws. Append. 26. 36. The law of 1742 gives a remedy for the recovery \u201cof any legacy or bequest of any sum of money\u201d to any person or persons. Miller. Laws. 130; 1 Dall. Laws, 449, 631. Neither of these laws contain any exception of corporations. The rights of conscience were declared inviolable by the charter of privileges of 1701, granted by William Penn to the people of the colony. No person who lived quietly un der the government and acknowledged one God, should be in any case molested, or prejudiced in his estate, because of his conscientious .persuasion (1 Dall. Laws, Append. 8, 10); and liberty of conscience was secured by a law approved in council (1 Dall. Laws, 43, 44). In 1712 an act was passed empowering all religious societies of Protestants within the province to purchase and hold lands for burying grounds, houses of worship, schools and hospitals; and, by trustees or otherwise, as they shall think fit to receive and take grants and conveyances for the same, for any estate whatever for the uses aforesaid. All sales, gifts or grants to such societies, or any persons in trust for them, were ratified and confirmed according to their tenor and meaning, and of the parties concerned. Gifts to the poor of these societies, or for their use, shall be employed only for the charitable uses for which they were given, according to what may be collected to be the true meaning of the donors or grantors, notwithstanding any failure in these gifts, grants or bequests. Bradf. Laws, 160. This law was repealed in council, twice enacted, and as often repealed. In 1710 the judges of the county court were made a court of equity, authorized to proceed according to the rules and practice of the high court of chancery of Great Britain, and an appeal was given to the supreme court, with power to decree as may be agreeable to equity and justice. Bradf. Laws, 103, 120. Though this law was repealed in 1713, and courts of chancery discontinued in 1736, the rules and principles of equity have always formed part of the common law of the state.\nThe sixth article of the charter to Penn provided, that the laws for regulating and governing property within the province, as well as for the descent and enjoyment of lands and goods and chattels, should be and continue the same as they should be for the time being, by the general course of the law of England, till the same should be altered. 1 Dall. Laws, Append. 3. The preamble to the act of 1718 recites that it is a settled point, that as the common law is the birthright of English subjects, so it ought to be the rule in British colonies. But acts of parliament have been adjudged not to extend to these plantations, unless they are particularly named in such acts (1 Dall. Laws, 129, 133); or, as has often been declared by the supreme court of the state, unless they are convenient, adapted to the circumstances of tlie colony, or have been in force by adoption, usage or long-continued practice, in courts of justice. [Morris v. Vanderen] 1 Dall. [1 U. S.] 67; [Respublica v. Mesca] Id. 74; 3 Bin. 596, 597; 1 Dall. Laws, 722. After repeated attempts to pass a law in favor of religious societies which would accord with the spirit of the colony, one was finally approved in council. The act of 1730-31 confirmed all sales, gifts and grants of land to any persons in trust for the use of any protestant religious society, for sites of churches, houses of religious worship, schools, almshouses and burying-grounds, made before the law. It also contained a provision which made it lawful in future, for any such society within the province to purchase, take, receive by gift, grant or otherwise, for the above specified uses and purposes, and for any estate whatsoever, and to hold the same for the said uses in fee, provided, that they should not take land for their maintenance or support, or for any other uses than those specified. 1 Dall. Laws, 270-273.\nThe constitution of 1776 declared, in the first section of the bill of rights, \u201cThat all .men have an equal right to acquire, possess and protect property;\u201d and in the eighth, \u201cThat every member of society hath aright to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property.\u201d 2. \u201cThat all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience and understanding.\" 3. \u201cNor can any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be justly deprived or abridged of his civil rights as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worship, and that no authority is or ought to be vested in any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship.\u201d In the frame of government (section 45): \u201cAnd all religious societies or bodies of men, heretofore united or incorporated for the advancement of religion or learning, or for other pious and charitable purposes, shall be encouraged and protected % the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities and estates which they were accustomed to enjoy, or could of right have enjoyed under the laws or former constitution of the state.\u201d Section 46. \u201cThe declaration of rights is hereby declared to be a part of the constitution of this commonwealth, and ought never to be violated on any pretence whatever.\u201d 1 Dall. Laws, Append. 55, 60; Conv. Pa. 55, 64.\nThe first law passed, on the change of government, declared the province laws in force till altered or repealed; also the common law, and such parts of the statute laws of England as had been before in force, \u2014 \u201cAnd so much of any law or act of assembly as declares, orders, directs or commands any matter or thing repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the constitution, is hereby declared not to be revived, but shall be null and void, and of no force or effect.\u201d 1 Dall. Laws, 722. The constitution of 1790, in article 7, \u00a7 1, provides, \u201cThat the legislature shall, as soon as may be, provide by law for the establishment of schools throughout the state, in such manner that the poor may be taught gratis.\u201d Section 2. \u201cThe arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more seminaries of learning.\u201d The 44th section of the old constitution contained similar provisions, though not so full. Section 3. \u201cThe rights, privileges, immunities and estates of religious societies and bodies corporate, shall remain as if the constitution of the state had not been altered or amended.\u201d The first three sections of the bill of rights are, in substance, the same as in the old one. The third concludes \u2014 \u201cand that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or modes of worship.\u201d Section 20. \u201cTo guard against the transgression of the high powers which we have delegated, we declare that every thing in this article is excepted out of the several powers of government, and shall for ever remain inviolate.\u201d In the first clause of the schedule it is ordained. \u201cThat all laws of this commonwealth in force at the time of malling the said alterations and amendments in the said constitution, and not inconsistent therewith, and all rights, actions, prosecutions, claims and contracts, as well of individuals as of bodies politic, shall continue as if the said alterations and amendments had not been made.\u201d 3 Dall. Laws, 32, 36. These provisions, and the law which immediately followed the adoption of the constitution, are a direct negative on the existence of any spirit of policy adverse to corporations.\nIn 1701. the act was passed \u201cto confer on certain associations of the citizens of this commonwealth, the powers and immunities of corporations, or bodies politic in law.\u201d The preamble recites the reasons to be the saving time to the legislature in enacting laws to incorporate private associations, and the convenience of individuals desirous of incorporation \u2014 and the law provides: \u201cThat when any number of persons, citizens of the state, are associated, or mean to associate for any literary, charitable or religious purpose, they are empowered to obtain a charter of incorporation, subject only to the following conditions: To state in writing the objects, articles and conditions of their associations, and if the attorney general and the supreme court shall certify their opinion that they are lawful, the governor shall order it to be enrolled; and the persons associated become an incorporated body in law and in fact; to have continuance by their corporate name and title. They are authorized to execute the usual corporate powers, and to make by-laws and ordinances, provided they are not repugnant to the constitution and laws of the United States, of this state, or to the instrument on which the corporation was established. The corporations and their successors shall be able and capable in law, according to the terms and conditions of the instrument on which they are established, to take and hold lands, money, goods and chattels given them, according to the articles and by-laws, or the will of the donor, provided the clear income does not exceed five hundred pounds yearly.\u201d \u201cAnd, whereas, bequests and legacies may be made to public institutions of which they may not derive the benefit intended, from a want of information,\u201d it is directed, that \u201cwhen a will is brought to the register\u2019s office, to be recorded, which shall contain a bequest or legacy to a public incorporate body, he shall give them notice within six months, of the nature and. amount of the legacy, and the name of the executor.\u201d 3 Dall. Laws, 40, 43. The law of 1818 enacts that where any lands are holden in trust for any religious society, or for any number of persons for the purpose of public worship or schools, or to be used as a burying-ground. or for charitable purposes; or where any estate of a personal nature, is or may be vested in any person or persons, to be applied by them to any religious, literary or charitable use or uses, and the trustee or trustees neglect or abuse such trust or trusts, the supreme court, or court of common pleas, on complaint made, may call on the trustees to answer; and if, on hearing, the court is satisfied that the trust has been neglected or abused, may and shall remove the trustees, and appoint others in their place, who shall be vested with the rights and powers of the former trustees, and give such security as is required. Section 2. The court shall have the power and jurisdiction of compelling the trustees to account before the court or auditors. Purd. Dig. 167; 7 Smith. Laws, 43, 44. This law was followed by the act of 1825, \u201cTo prevent the failure of trusts.\u201d The supreme court is authorized to grant relief in equity in all eases of trusts, so far as regards the appointment of trustees, either in consequence of the death, infancy, lunacy or other inability, or where a trustee renounces or refuses to act, or one or more dies, or becomes non compos, and a joint action is requisite, and to compel a conveyance of the legal estate, when the trust has expired. On the application of any person interested in the execution of the trust, the court may appoint a trustee, having regard to the objects of the trust as fully as a court of equity can do. and the rights of the former trustee shall vest in him; on the application of trustees, the court may remove them and appoint others. The act of 1828 confers the same powers on the courts of common pleas, district and circuit courts. Purd. Dig. S5S-860.\nProm this summary of the legislation of Pennsylvania, it appears to have partaken of the spirit of its successive constitutions, and to have been constantly progressive, in the completion and perfection of the system of its founder, each succeeding law being more liberal in its principles, and more expanded in its provisions. The principles of the charter of Penn continued in force and protected all religious societies in the enjoyment of their rights of worship and property. in their houses of devotion, after the repeal of the act of 1712 by the council, and the passage of the act of 1730, as before. In 1733-34, Governor Gordon informed the council that a house had been erected in Walnut street for the exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, in which mass was openly celebrated, contrary to the laws of England, particularly to the statute of 12 Wm. III., which extended to the colonies. The council were of a different opinion, and declared that the Catholics were protected by the charter of privileges and the law concerning liberty of conscience; but they referred the subject to the governor, that he might consult his superiors at home. No other proceedings however took place. Gord. 216. This opinion of the council accords with the declaration of William Penn to the members of the assembly, in 1701, \u201cThat he had justly given privileges the precedency of property as the bulwark to secure the other.\u201d 2 Clarkson\u2019s Life of Penn, 203. It was a rule of property, and the basis of the usage and common law of the state. The opinion of the council was the practical exposition of the charter, as understood and acknowledged, of which there cannot be a stronger case than the one that occurred. The 11 & 12 Wm. III. c. 4, prohibited the celebration of mass in any of the dominions of England, under a penalty of perpetual imprisonment. 4 Ruffh. St. 41. If this statute included the colonies, it was repealed by the charter; if it did not, there was no law professing or attempting to interfere with it as a fundamental law of the colony.\nThe list of laws rejected by the king in council shows the constant struggle between the policy of the colony and mother country (Hall & Sellers\u2019 L. 21, 57, 67, 99, 125, 193, 199, 276; Miller\u2019s L. 16, 74, 158), which ended only with the Kevolution. The usage continued, in despite of the efforts of the king and council to prevent it from having the sanction of the law, and the provisions of the constitution were as broad as the usage. Its phraseology is adapted to the inconveniences which existed, and its provisions afford a remedy commensurate with the mischief arising from the want of a legal sanction to rights indispensable to the enjoyment of practical liberty of conscience, as a bulwark to property. In the Case of Cedar Springs Congregation, the trust did not depend on the enabling provisions of the statute, but on the custom of the province, as stated in Witman v. Lex [supra]; Methodist Church v. Remington, 6 Bin. 59 [1 Watts, 218]. The evidence of this custom appears in all the acts for granting charters, and in the law of 1791, in relation to the lots held by the Quaker societies in Front street, and at the comer of Fourth and Arch streets. 3 Dall. Laws, 46, 47. The proceeding before the council in 1734 is unequivocal evidence of the claim of right by the Catholic societies, according to the usage under the charter of' 1701; so that we have from the most authentic sources full evidence of the existence of a custom and usage, expressly saved and preserved by the constitution of 1776, which operates not only prospectively, but refers by express terms to the former constitution of 1701, so as to make the usage of the same force from that time, as it would have had, if the state had been then independent of the mother country, as she was in 1776. Being saved by the supreme law, the custom had the same force as the law itself, and stood on the same basis as customs saved by Magna Charta, according to the rules of law before laid down.\nThe constitution of 1776, then puts the rights which could be enjoyed by the previous custom of the province, on the same footing as if they had been defined in detail in the 45th section, and the present constitution makes them perpetual. If any additional sanction could be given to them by human authority, it will be found in the first amendment to the constitution of the United States. \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d This extends to the judicial as well as legislative departments of the government, and annuls all jurisdiction over the subject matter, past or future. [Marbury v. Madison] 1 Cranch [5 U. S.] 174-179; [Bingham v. Cabot] 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 382. If the rights of a religious or literary society are derived from a contract or grant, no state law can impair their obligation, and the supreme court have placed them under the same constitutional protection as those of individuals. [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 45; [Mason v. Muncaster] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 454; [Society v. Town of New Haven] 8 Wheat. [21 U. S.] 480; [Dartmouth College v. Woodward] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 624. To deny to bodies united without a charter any rights of property which could be enjoyed by a corporate body, would be in direct opposition to both the constitutions of the state and union, and the custom of the province. \u201cIncorporations were almost unknown; yet to all sorts of pious and charitable associations, in every part of the province, valuable bequests were made by those who were ignorant of the niceties of expression necessary to accomplish the object at common law. Nothing was more frequent than bequests to unincorporated congregations, without the intervention of trustees; and even when there was a corporation, it frequently happened that the corporate designation was mistaken, or the trust vaguely defined. Notwithstanding which, the testator\u2019s bounty was uniformly applied to the object.\u201d Surely a usage of such early origin and extensive application, may claim the sanction of a law, resting, as it does on the basis of all our laws of domestic origin, the legislation of common consent. 17 Serg. & R. 91, 92. The same principle is adopted in all governments. A usage or custom is presumed to have had its origin in a law once in existence, and lost in the lapse of time, the evidence whereof being by prescription, that supplies the place of the written law, which is taken to have been as broad as the usage. ' The law presumed from a custom, has the same force as one appearing on the rolls of parliament\u2014 the only difference is in the mode of proof; and the rule that a custom shall not prevail against an act of parliament unless it is saved and preserved by a statute. 3 Dow, Parl. Cas. 112; Austruther 614; 1 Dow, Parl. Cas. 322. The supreme law of England and the states of this Union which have no written constitutions of government, is proved only by legislative usage, which is the evidence of their constitution and supreme law. [Calder v. Bull] 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 400; [Wilkinson v. Leland] 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 656, 657; [U. S. v. Arredondo] 6 Pet. [31 U. S.] 714, 715. On whatever subject a known and recognized usage exists, it forms the law of the case, and controls all affirmative statutes, and the rules of the common law \u2014 as a general or local law, according to its nature. [U. S. v. Arredondo] Id. 715, and cases cited. The reason is obvious \u2014 it is founded on a law presumed from the prescription. This presumption is not that such a law ever, in fact, existed, but \u201cit is adopted as a general principle, to take the place of individual or specific belief.\u201d 12 Ves. 265, 266; 10 Johns. 380; [Prevost v. Gratz] 6 Wheat. [19 U. S.] 504. Though the party claiming by prescription produces his title, and it is worth nothing, the court will direct the jury to presume another grant subsequently. All shall be presumed to be done, which shall make the ancient appropriation good, and the right shall be presumed from the prescription, if it could have had a legal beginning. 12 Coke, 5; Cowp. 109, 110. The same rule applies to the franchises of a corporation (4 Mod. 55; 1 Saund. 345; 1 Rolle, Abr. 512), \u201cfor whatever may commence by grant, is good by prescription.\u201d Where possession has been long held under a claim of right, to the exclusive enjoyment of the lands of the crown, a patent, charter, or grant of the king will be presumed. 1 Dow. P. C. 322. The same rule is applied in this country, \u2014 14 Mass. 534.\u2014 though the possession was taken and held under a defective title, \u2014 [Society v. Town of Pawlet] 4 Pet. [29 U. S.] 506, 507; [Jackson v. Huntington] 5 Pet. [30 U. S.] 439, 440. The principle has been applied in Pennsylvania to a religious society, which has been long in possession of a piece of ground, on which they had erected a church, used it for public worship, and occupied an adjoining piece for a burial-ground, and another piece for the free passage of the congregation, and the accommodation of horses and carriages, according to what the supremo court declared the common usage. This possession was held to be sufficient to enable the society \u201cto recover in ejectment, and sufficient for a presumption, that the commonwealth had granted the land to the predecessors of the plaintiffs, or made a promise of a grant which would establish a right of pre-emption.\u201d Mather v. Ministers of Trinity Church, 3 Serg. & R. 510, 511.\nEither presumption is sufficient for all the purposes of this case. The only difference between a grant and a pre-emption is the payment of the purchase money, which must precede the formal consummation by patent; but when paid, the right to a patent, and the enjoyment of the estate against the commonwealth is complete. We may now assume these principles to be settled, that usage and customs have the force of laws \u2014 that those which are saved and presen ed by the constitution of this state are its supreme law \u2014 and that rights declared in the constitution, or which have been, or could be enjoyed according to customs or usage, saved and preserved, neither depend on legislative discretion, nor can be impaired, much less forfeited, by legislative power. It follows, that no charter can be requisite to give a capacity already existing by usage, or asserted in the bill of rights or constitution, or a dispensation from a forfeiture, which no law was competent to enforce or prescribe. Hence, the course of the legislature has been, in granting special acts of incorporation to religious, literary and charitable societies, strictly in the spirit of the constitution, to superadd to their constitutional rights, the privileges, franchises and iinmu-nities of corporations, to confer the powers of corporate bodies, \u201cto further their objects and charitable designs,\u201d to put all religious societies on the same footing, as to the encouragoment and protection afforded by the constitution (Bradf. Laws, 11, 23, 52, 89; Laws 1790, p. 285) by imparting to them such powers as would enable them to manage their corporate concerns, and enjoy their corporate property by their own by-laws and officers, and to assert their rights in their corporate capacity; not to give the capacity to take property, nor to release it from the forfeiture of mortmain. Charters were given to Catholic societies, \u201cto enable them to manage the temporalities of the church, as fully as any other religious society could do.\u201d Laws 1789, pp. 456. 532; [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 49; [Town of Pawlet v. Clark] Id. 326. 327. A lottery was granted for the benefit of the Hebrew congregation, in order to save their property from sale by execution. The preamble contained this recital \u2014 \u201cAnd whereas. it is just and proper that all religious societies should be protected, so far as is consistent with the principles of the constitution.\u201d Laws 1790, p. 310; 2 Dall. Laws. 817.\nIn most of the laws granting charters, there is a recital to this effect, \u201cthat it is just and right, agreeably to the true spirit of the constitution, that the prayer be granted;\u201d or, \u201cthat this house is disposed to exercise their powers for the encouragement of all pious and charitable uses.\u201d Bradf. Laws, 37, 223, 407; Laws 1789, pp. 189, 198, 225, 285. They are retrospective to the property held by the society, before the incorporation, in some cases by deeds in trust for their use; in others, to the society by their name of association only, of which there are more than thirty instances in Bradford\u2019s Laws, which fully establish the fact of the universal usage throughout the state, for all religious societies to enjoy estates without actual incorporation. What expresses the sense of the legislature most unequivocally is, the law of X7S9, which, after reciting the 45th section of the constitution, declared so much of the law of 1779, relating to the college and charitable school of Philadelphia, as was repugnant to the charter from the proprietor, to he void, on the ground \u201cthat the charter gave them rights which were entitled to encouragement and protection in the free enjoyment and exercise thereof, in conformity to the will of the donor, in the same manner as it could have of right occupied and enjoyed the same under the former laws and constitution,\u201d and that the law was \u201crepugnant to justice, a violation of the constitution, and dangerous in its precedent to all incorporated bodies, and the rights and franchises thereof.\u201d 2 Dall. Laws, 650, 651. When such is the fact of the constitution, it certainly could not be the law of the state, that bodies united or incorporated, needed any other protection for their rights, privileges or estates. They could be submitted to no other test than usage; and though the legislature could not be coerced to grant an incorporation, they could not infringe any right which could be enjoyed under the constitution. They might refuse them the franchises necessary to transmit property by mere succession, and to govern the society by corporate officers and bylaws; but as all the individual members were capable in law of acquiring it, no power could take it from them.\nThe inhabitants of a town may take in succession by a grant to tljeir singular heirs, a private person may build and endow a house for a school, an hospital, a church, or abiding houses for the poor, without incorporation: but he could not, by his own grant, give it corporate franchise of succession. 10 Coke, 26, 27; 2 Co. Inst. 202; [Town of Pawlet v. Clark] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 329. The rule of the common law is recognized and well illustrated in the preamble to the 39 Eliz. c. 5, for the erection of hospitals, &c., by private persons, \u2014 the reason for which is declared to be, \u201cunderstanding and finding that such good law has not taken such good effect as was intended, by reason that no person can erect or incorporate any hospital,\u201d &c., \u201cbut her majesty, or by her highness\u2019 special license, by letters patent in that behalf to be obtained.\u201d The act then authorized the creation of incorporations by the deed of the founder enrolled in chancery, without any act of the crown, with full corporate powers and franchises and to make any bylaws not repugnant to the laws of the kingdom. Keb. St. 921; 2 Ruffh. 687, 688. This statute was evidently the pattern for the act of 1791, as appears by the title, the preamble, and the enacting clauses. Neither contain any restrictions on any unincorporated societies or bodies; their provisions are remedial, in order to facilitate the enjoyment of charitable donations, and the furtherance of charitable objects, by corporate franchises; to enable an individual to do what he could not do without a law; \u2014 to give a private deed the effect of a public grant, in order to complete the pious and charitable work by the charter of the donor or founder, without a special application to the crown or assembly. 10 Coke, 25-34; [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 49. Both laws are founded on an existing right to make the donation; and if the right of property had not been understood to have been fixed and settled, the legislature would never have interfered to secure its enjoyment in perpetuity by succession, as a continuing corporate franchise with no other limitation to the power of making by-laws, than the laws of the land, the will of the donor or founder, and the articles of association; placing the incorporation on the authority of parliament, in England, and in this state making it a contract or legislative grant, the obligation of which cannot be impaired by the state.\nAll the analogous legislation of England is bottomed on the right of private persons, singly or associated, to take and hold estates of inheritance by apt words of grant to themselves and their heirs, which is a common law right of all subjects who are under no legal incapacity. In this respect the law of both countries is the same; the only difference between them consists in two particulars: \u2014 1. In England, those persons who have devoted themselves to religion, withdrawn from the world, and entered into holy orders, are not deemed in law to have any civil existence until they have acquired the capacity of natural persons by the removal of the disabilities arising from their profession and the restoration of their original. right. In this state, there is no such disability. The bill of rights declares it to be the natural and inherent right of all men to acquire, possess and enjoy property, and the constitution protects all members of society in their persons and estates. No common law disability, therefore, can obstruct the vesting of a constitutional right, and as no law can take it away, no charter is necessary to confer it, or to restore what has not been relinquished or lost. 2. In England, there are statutory disabilities on corporations, whereby they are less favored than individuals or bodies not incorporated; but, in this state, they are subject to no restraints, and in the constitution are placed on the same footing of protection as private persons or bodies united without a charter \u2014 there is of course no necessity of any law to repeal a statutory disability, or of a license by any subordinate authority, to perfect a right conferred by a supreme law. If an act of parliament had contained the same provisions as the constitution of this state, and the statute of 34 & 35 Hen. VIII. had contained no exception for corporations, there could have been no doubt that any religious society could have taken an estate in fee without a charter, and enjoyed it in mortmain without a license. There can be no clearer evidence of the common law right, than the enactment of statutes to take it away, nor is any rule better established, than that an exception of a particular case is an admission that the case would have been embraced in the law or constitution, if no exception had been made. [Gibbons v. Ogden] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 207; [Brown v. State of Maryland] 12 Wheat. [25 U. S.] 436-438.\nThe application of this rule to the jurisprudence of this state will furnish a solution of all the difficulties which have attended the investigation of the law of charities, and lead to results which cannot be erroneous. The reason of the law is the law itself, and we have only to look to the reasons which call for an incorporation in England for. the want of an act of parliament removing the disabilities of religious persons, and to bear in mind that the effect of the constitution must necessarily be that here ecclesiastics or persons in holy orders have a capacity to purchase, which is denied to them by the policy of the common law. Hence arises the necessity of an incorporation by charter or prescription, to give them the capacity of natural persons, by removing the disability arising from their being professed men of religion, as monks, friars and canons, who are deemed dead persons in law; but when one of them becomes a bishop, an abbot, &c., he is the head or sovereign of the house, having a secular capacity to purchase and hold land, through whom the monks or the convent become as natural persons, and remain so while there is a sovereign or head. A grant to an abbot and his monks, or to the abbot and convent, is good, and vests the title in perpetuity. If the grant is made while there is a vacancy in the head or sovereignty, the fee remains in abeyance, but vests whenever the vacancy is filled. Perk. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 51, 55; Litt. \u00a7\u00a7 443, 655; Co. Litt. 263, 346b; [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 47; [Town of Pawlet v. Clark], Id. 329; [Beatty v. Kurtz], 2 Pet. 27 U. S.] 580. The reason why a giant to monks or to a convent, who have never had a head or sovereign by charter or prescription, is bad, is \u201cthat when a man taketh lands or tenements by purchase he ought to be of ability to take the same when it falleth to him by purchase.\u201d Perk. \u00a7 505. Monks have not this capacity, because they are all dead persons in law; but the abbot, who is the sovereign, &c., and this by reason of the sovereignty, for otherwise he should be but as one of the other monks of the convent. Co. Litt. \u00a7 655; Id. 345b. And the grant cannot take effect, though a corporation was made afterwards. 2 Coke 51b; Hob. 33; 8 Vin. Abr. 56, H; Perk. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; Co. Litt. 2a, 3a. The reason of this rule shows that it is confined to grants to persons who have no personal capacity or civil existence. It cannot apply to natural persons, who have a common law right, guarantied in this state, and declared inviolable, as to whom a charter could have no effect except to confer some corporate franchise which was not of right by law. There is no rule of the English law which requires a charter to enable a society or body of capable persons to take and hold property'in fee by proper and apt words of inheritance. Any opinion to the contrary must be founded on the misapplication of the foregoing rule, as is evident from the cases referred to by the counsel in the argument of the case [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 1; and in not discriminating between the right of holding an estate of inheritance with and without proper words to convey it, and between the effects of a deed which transmits from ancestor to heir, or a charter which passes it from predecessor to successor. A grant to the commonalty, parishioners, inhabitants or good men of a place (Co. Litt. 3a), the commoners of a waste (Shep. Touch. 230, 237), the people of the county of O., or to associates, being a settlement of Friends at S., does not enable them to hold an inheritable estate without a charter (Perk. \u00a7 510), if they could take any estate or privilege it would be only for the lives of the then existing inhabitants (2 Johns. Cas. 323; 9 Johns. 75), as in case of a grant to a single-person, omitting \u201cand his heirs.\u201d They arc-capable of taking the fee by proper words of grant to themselves and their heirs, or to another in trust for their use (8 Johns. 388: Shep. Touch. 337), but some person or body politic must be named who can take by force of the grant, as a mayor and commonalty (Perk. \u00a7 64), or the church-wardens of such a church (Perk, g 55), in ancient time (Co. Litt. 3a). and now by custom (Cro. Eliz. 145, 179). The parishioners, inhabitants or good men of Dale are capable to purchase goods by such name. Co. Litt. 3a. The only reason why they cannot purchase in fee by that name is that they are not a permanent (Hob. 80), continuing body having succession. Any estate conveyed to them in fee must descend to their singular heirs, unless they have no charter or prescription, tin-franchise of a body politic, which is the only thing required to enable them to hold in perpetuity by succession.\nThese considerations lead to the object and effect of an incorporation in England, first, to give to ecclesiastical persons the same civil capacity to purchase as other natural persons have by right; and, secondly, to confer the franchise of succession. In this state, the first object is effected by the constitution, and the incorporation is necessary only for the second. The only difficulty then is to distinguish between the natural rights of all the members of the society which constitutes the state a body politic, and those which are conferred by charter or law on a body of men who are the members of a society united for particular purposes. The common law requires no charter to enable a body of men in any place to purchase chattels or receive do nations of money, a chattel interest, or an estate for the lives of the grantees, in land, by their name, as a body, without other words. If one is necessary, it can be only to give them some privilege, immunity or exemption from the rigor of the common law, so as to make them as a natural person capable of enjoying an estate in fee without words of inheritance. A corporation is a permanent thing, that may have succession, an assembly of many into one body (Terms of Law, 123), an artificial body constituted of several members, united by its franchises and liberties, which form its ligaments and are'its frame and essence' (Lil. Pr. Reg. 459), which never dies, and exists only in its political capacity (1 Bl. Comm. 468-470), which unites and knits them together as a natural person (Id. 272); or a person who is made by policy and fiction of law a body politic, with the capacity of succession in perpetuity, but which exists in both a natural and political capacity (Wood. Inst. 109; 1 Bl. Comm. 468\u2014470). The corporation aggregate, which never dies, and can take only in one capacity, holds in perpetuity by a grant to itself without words of succession; but a corporation sole, existing in both capacities, takes only for life, unless the word \u201csuccessors\u201d is added, so as to denote the intention to convey to him in his politic capacity of succession. Co. Litt. 8, 9, 94a, 96b, 250; Perk. \u00a7 240; Plowd. 496; Wood. Inst. Eng. Law, 111; Terms of Law, 124; Cro. Jac. 532. Succession is a corporate franchise, by which property passes from predecessor to successor, as it does from ancestor to heir, by inheritance. Terms of Law, 123; 4 Coke, 65a. Succession is not a word of inheritance. A grant to a private person and his successors carries only a life estate. Succession must be granted by a charter from the crown, or a law making the grantees a corporation, so that their rights devolve on their successors by virtue of the franchise. The object and effect of the incorporation is to create the artificial person with the same capacity as the natural person. Whenever it exists as a perpetual body, in the exercise of this franchise, its uninterrupted enjoyment is evidence of a charter presumed to be lost, and it is a corporation in fact and in law. Perk. \u00a7 34; Co. Litt. 132b; 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 300; 1 Saund. 345; 1 Mod. 55. The word \u201csuccessors\u201d is not in all cases indispensable to vest an interest by a grant o\u00ed-an obligation in the successor of a sole corporation; as where a grant is made to an abbot and his convent, to hold in frank-almoigne the tenure imports succession, and as the celebration of divine service and free alms are continuing objects, the estate is in perpetuity, as in case of a gift in frank-marriage. Litt. \u00a7 133; Co. Litt. 93b, 94a; s. p. [Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor) 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 146, 147. So where, by a local custom, the right passes to the successor, though not named, as the chamberlains of London (Terms of Law, 124; 1 Lil. Pr. Reg. 383, 384; 4 Coke, 65a; Cro. Eliz. 464, 682; Hob. 247; 5 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 17); so, of church-wardens who are a corporation by prescription throughout the kingdom, with capacity to take and hold money and chattels for the church, but not lands, yet they may hold lands by special custom in succession as a corporation (March, 67, pl. 104; Cro. Eliz. 145, 179; Cro. Jac. 532; Cro. Car. 455; [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 45, 53; [Town of Pawlet v. Clark] Id. 328; 17 Serg. & R. 92). Neither are any particular words necessary to create the corporation; a public grant of corporate privileges is, per se, an incorporation to give the capacity of enjoyment according to the grant; as to the inhabitants of a town, to have guildam mer-catoriam, which unites them by the franchise, and makes them as a natural person for the purpose. 10 Coke, 30a; 1 Rolle, Abr. 513; 1 Bl. Comm. 474. And as the only thing for which a charter is necessary is, to grant the franchise of succession, its actual enjoyment and exercise is, per se, evidence that it was by lawful and competent authority. 1 Bac. Abr. 500; 10 Coke, 28a; 1 Bl. Comm. 475\u2014479; 1 Lil. Pr. Reg. 459. London itself is only a corporation by prescription. 5 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 17, H. If then the religious, literary and charitable societies which have existed in this state had no other foundation for their rights of property, than the principles of the common law and long usage, they could not be disturbed for want of an actual incorporation by charter or law; and when we add to these rights, those expressly secured to them by the constitutions of the state and Union, we cannot doubt that they are as inviolable as a charter could make them. To decide that any one was necessary to enable a religious society to enjoy the sites and buildings for worship, for charity, for education and sepulture, and funds for the maintenance and support of poor, would be a declaration that the rights of conscience and worship could be made dependent on the discretion of the legislature. And, if a charter could be withheld from any society, united for religious purposes, so as to impair their rights of property, then a preference could be given to modes of worship; there would be a virtual prohibition of the free exercise of religion, and the sect favored by the legislature would be, in substance, a religious establishment.\nConnecting with the whole course of the legislation of Pennsylvania, the well known fact which appears in the record in this cause, that the societies of Quakers have never been incorporated, it is not credible, that their right to hold their places of worship and charity, and to enjoy donations of land and money, is a mere shadow, without a charter in fact. In our opinion, they have had from 1701, and yet have, a charter more firm than any patent or law can create, the great charter of Penn, which was the basis of the usage and custom of the prov- inee, and by its incorporation into the supreme law of the state, is the rule and standard of right by which our judgment must be guided. The law of 1777 repeals all laws inconsistent with its provisions, whether those of the mother country or the colony; and declares that laws not inconsistent with it shall remain in force, as well as such statutes and common law in England as have been heretofore adopted. The laws of 1705 in relation to deeds and wills, which have no exception of corporations, the law of 1730-31, which actually amortises the sites of houses of worship and burial grounds, then in possession of religious societies, devoted or erected for the purposes of religion or charity, were also a direct license to all Protestant religious societies to take and hold in mortmain by future grants and gifts. The law of usage which, being saved by the constitution, became a supreme law, gave the same right to all societies united or incorporated for these purposes, whether Protestant or not. As the custom of the province was in accordance with the rejected laws of 1710, in relation to the powers and duties of courts of equity, to the law of 1711, for the confirmation of public grants, and of 1712, in relation to religious societies, and the various acts concerning liberty of conscience and the privileges of freemen, and as this custom is the law of the state, according to which lands have been held in mortmain from its first settlement, we are bound to give it the same effect as is given to the custom of London by all the rules and principles of law in relation to the construction of statutes, We must apply those which have been adopted on the 43 Eliz., as laid down by the supreme court, to the constitution and laws of the state, and construe them most favorably and benignly, for the promotion of all objects connected with the maintenance of religion, the advancement of learning, the relief of the poor, and public utility; so that the rights, privileges, immunities and estates thus guarantied, shall be enjoyed unimpaired here, at least as far as they are in England, by this statute. No one can compare its provisions with the legislation of the state, and hesitate, for a moment, in saying that they fall far short of the protection given by our own laws to donations for pious and charitable uses. If the 43 Eliz. has by universal consent been considered as pro tanto a repeal of the statutes of mortmain, of superstitious uses, and restraints on corporations by the statutes of wills, they cannot be in force in this state, unless we reverse the whole course of the law, in the exposition of statutes, by construing them liberally in favour of forfeitures, and strictly against charities, so as to abrogate common law rights by equity, and defeat the remedy provided by statutes for their protection.\nIt must be remembered, that these are mere statutes of policy in contravention of the common law. The old statutes of mort-main were passed to prevent the king and mesne lords from being deprived of their seignioral and feudal rights accruing by prerogative and tenure. The statutes of Hen. VIH. and Edw. VI. were aimed avowedly against tlil rights of the Catholic religion. Its suppression being their great object, donations for its support were declared \u201cto be superstitious uses, mala in se, and destructive to our constitution and government under the Protestant religion; therefore the law prohibits them, but it is not so with charities, which have always been favored.\u201d The true foundation of the statute of mortmain of 9 Geo. II. was, that enough of lands had got into the hands of corporations that were indissoluble; and even now charities may be established in the lifetime of a person, but shall not be done in his last moments. 3 Atk. 148, by Lord Hardwicke. The history of the times gives another reason for this statute: It was passed in the session of 1735-36, during a period of high excitement against the Catholics, and when the church was deemed to be in such danger that a bill for the relief of the Quakers from severe disabilities was thrown out in the house of lords after passing the commons. 5 Hume, 617, 618; 3 Rapin, 225, 226. It is not congenial to the policy of this state to incorporate such principles into its system, nor would it be creditable to the character of its legislation to expound it unfavorably to those rights and institutions which were favored, protected and spared by the laws of a king who spared little besides. If any statutes were suited to the policy of the state, they are the 43 Eliz. and the 7 & S Wm. III. c. 37, an act for the encouragement of charitable gifts and dispositions, which in favor of learning, charity and other good and public uses, authorized the king to grant licenses to any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, their heirs and successors, to purchase and alien land, in mortmain, in perpetuity or otherwise, without being subject to forfeiture. 3 Ruffh. 636. It may well be presumed, that the emigrants from England brought with them these principles for adoption, and en-grafted them into their system of religious toleration and charities; but that they ever adopted any law which created a forfeiture for an alienation of property to any religious, literary or charitable society or corporation or prohibited donations for the uses of worship, according to the ritual of the Catholic church, is utterly inconsistent with the established usage, and every law of the state or colony from *he earliest to the present time.\nThe law must be settled beyond all doubt before we can feel justified in deciding that the rights of religious societies and of charitable and literary institutions, in Pennsylvania, are less firmly established than they were in the mother country. As to the statutes of superstitious uses, it suffices to say that where there can be no religious estab lishment, no restraint on the iree exercise of religion, and no preference of modes of worship, the celebration of divine service according to the rites of any church or society worshiping the Supreme Being, cannot be deemed unlawful or superstitious; nor can an actual incorporation or express lieense be necessary to give- to any society or body of men the capacity of enjoying any right in accordance with a custom or usage, incorporated into the constitution, in order to save a forfeiture, by an alienation in mort-main, where none is in a like case imposed by the law of England. The Revolution devolved on the state all the transcendent power of parliament, and the prerogative of the crown, \u2014 [Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 651, \u2014 and gave their acts the same force and effect; consequently, a grant, charter or law made by its authority is, by the principles of the common law, equally binding on the state, as a patent or act of parliament is on the king. The state can take no estate by forfeiture when the alienation is expressly authorized by its laws, and the enjoyment of the estate secured to the grantee by constitutional provisions, which except the subject matter from all the powers of government.\nIt would be a remarkable feature in the legislation of the state, if, while its successive constitutions have made the rights of bodies united or incorporated its especial favorites, and its laws give the right of self-incorporation to all religious, literary and charitable associations, and so far depart from the jealous policy of the state against chancery jurisdiction as to provide special remedies for the execution of trusts in their, favor, both as to real and personal property, they should be still considered as reprobates, outlawed by the statutes of mortmain, and their estates forfeited by the very act of a conveyance to a corporation directly, or to trustees for their use. If any, the least respect is paid to the constitutions, they must be considered as placing corporations on the same footing at least, if not a better, than in England; yet if the judicial dicta which we find in the cases are the law of the state, the statutes of mortmain are in full force, while those which have softened their rigour have not been adopted, and the supreme law of the state is a very nullity, incompetent to protect charities, even to the extent of the 43 Eliz. or the 7 & 8 Wm. III. There is no escape from this conclusion, if we take these dicta as the settled law of the state. If the statutes of mortmain are a part of the jurisprudence of the state, they have been so from its first settlement; and as they have been in no way modified or altered,they must be taken to have been adopted to their full extent, so as to cover the mischief they were intended to remedy, by creating the forfeiture, and giving the state the right to seize the lands aliened, or the mesne landlord to enter, as the land may have been held under the one or the other. 7 Serg. & R. 320. As the tenures of Pennsylvania are free and common socage, there were no seigniorial rights accruing by tenure, which could be defeated by an alienation in mortmain, except in case of a person seised of lands, dying intestate, and without known kindred, when the land escheated to the immediate landlord of whom it was holden, or to the proprietary, if he held immediately from him; according to the colonial law of 1705 (1 Dall. Laws, Append. 45, \u00a7 12), which remained in force till 1787, when the escheat was declared to be to the state (2 Dall. Laws, 553). The mesne landlord, then, was till that time, entitled to the benefit of the forfeiture, and the license of the king or proprietary was no dispensation without the consent of the party to whom it accrued; the king could renounce his own right, but not the right of a subject; before the statute of Wm. III. it could be done only by the power of parliament. Vaughan, 333-343, 356; Co. Litt. 99a. By the law of England, the license of the king and mesne lords is not alone sufficient; there must be a writ of ad quod damnum, to ascertain what damage it would be to any other person, to alien in mortmain. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. tit. \u201cWrit of Ad Quod Damnum\u201d (222), 493, etc. It follows, that a patent, license or charter from the proprietary, under the colonial government, or from the president of the council, before 1787, would not have saved the forfeiture to the immediate landlord, without his consent, and the writ of ad quod dam-num; for if the statutes were in force, either by adoption or as \u201cthe general course of the law of England,\u201d or the common law, they remained in force till they were altered or repealed, as declared in the acts of 1718 and 1777, as fully as if they had been re-enacted; and a license can have no greater effect here than it had in England before the statute of 7 & 8 Wm. III. which was passed in 1695, thirteen years after the charter to Penn. \u201cWith respect to English statutes enacted since the settlement of Pennsylvania, it has been assumed as a principle, that they do not extend here, unless they have been rec-ognised by our acts of assembly, or adopted by long-continued practice in courts of justice.\u201d 3 Bin. 597. As there is not a spark of evidence of such recognition or adoption, we .have no legislative or judicial authority for saying that it is now in force; consequently, no license would save the forfeiture before 1787.\nThe supreme court has declared it to be a point conceded, that the 43 Eliz. has not been extended to this country. \u201cBut we consider the principles which chancery has adopted in the application of its principles to particular cases, as obtaining here, not indeed by the force of the statute, but as part of our common law, and where the object is defined, and we are not restrained by the inadequacy of the instrument which we are compelled to employ, nearly if not- altogether, we give relief to that extent that chancery does in England.\u201d 17 Serg. & R. 91,. Assuming this position of the court to be correct, the inevitable conclusion is, that we \u00a1 have not adopted the great operative principles, by which it has been held in courts of law, as well as in equity, to be a repeal of the statutes of mortmain, de donis condition, alibus, and of the restriction on corporations ! by the statute of wills. 3 Atlc. 130. This ! is the effect produced, which has given to that statute its importance: those statutes interposed barriers to the vesting and enjoyment of property for pious\" and charitable uses, which the 43 Eliz. removed, so that they became opened for the exercise of the equity powers of courts of chancery as completely as if no previous disability by statute had ever existed; and this is the reason why it has ever been considered in England as the Magna Oharta of charities, that, being an enabling statute, it repealed all disabling ones. If we assume that this leading feature, this vital spirit of the statute, has not been adopted here, we should be bound to consider the prohibitory statutes which it repealed, as in force here in all their rigor; i if we follow the report of the judges made in ISOS, as explained and adopted by the declaration which they made in subsequent cases, in connection with the opinion in Wit-man v. Lex, above quoted, we must declare the law of mortmain to apply to all donations of land to corporations, for pious and charitable uses, without the benefits of the statutes of Eliz., or Wm. III., to mitigate their severity or save the forfeiture.. Strange as this result may be, it is unavoidable, if the protection which these statutes throw around charities in England does not exist here, or has been taken away by the statute, common law or usage of the state. They operate equally on all societies, whether incorporated by prescription, by special act of assembly, or the charter of the proprietary; so that the enjoyment of their estates depends on legislative discretion, in granting a dispensation of the forfeiture, accruing by an alienation to bodies, and for purposes not only valid, but favored, encouraged and protected in England, without license, under the 43 Eliz., or by the license of the king under the 7 & S Wm. III. This latter statute was passed shortly after the first settlement of this colony; its words show the policy of the times to be favorable to all charitable institutions, and connected with the political history of England, its passage is a striking illustration of the disposition of parliament to make them its peculiar favorites.\nOne of the great principles of the Revolution of 1GSS, was a denial to the king of the power of dispensing with, or suspending of laws, or the execution thereof. It was the first item of abdication of the crown by James II. as set forth by the lords and commons in convention, that he had exercised it without consent of parliament; and a declaration that it was illegal, was the first and second items of the bill of rights (3 Ruffh. St. 440, 441), which was made a fundamental law of the kingdom. There could therefore be no stronger indication of the spirit of the times in favor of charities, than by authorizing the king to dispense with the statute of mortmain in their favor, making it an exception to a great rule and principle of government; and we deem it incredible that a less liberal spirit could have entered into the legislation of the colony: yet, if the statutes of mortmain have been adopted, there can be no power to dispense with their forfeiture, but by the legislature. The principle of the Revolution of 1(188 has been carried into all the American constitutions: no governor can exempt a corpoiation from the forfeiture of mortmain by his license or charter, with a clause of non obstante statuto; and no act of assembly before or since the Revolution has exempted charities from the effects of mort-main. There are, therefore, but two alternatives for us to adopt; the first, that the statutes of mortmain have been in force from the first settlement of the province, that the statutes which, in England, have mitigated their rigor, and made them in some measure conformable to our usage and condition, the laws and constitution, have not been adopted, and that there has never been any power to dispense with the forfeiture, unless in the party to whom it accrued. Or, that they never were introduced by our ancestors, as any part of their code. In the choice of these alternatives, we cannot hesitate \u2014 we cannot look at one item of legislation upon the subject, whether of supreme or subordinate authority, or into the ancient customs and unbroken usage of the state, without at once perceiving the total repugnance between the whole policy of the state, and the existence of British statutes, which would compel us to declare that every house of worship erected in the colony from the time of William Penn, stands upon ground forfeited by a conveyance to a religious society or corporation. It was due to the weight of judicial authority which bore on these questions, to examine them through the details of the law of England, as well as of the state, before we would venture to dissent from it; it was due especially to the high legislative authority which has declared what in its view was the policy and law' of the state, as to the disabilities of corporations. The thirty-fourth section of the judiciary act [1 Stat. 92] makes it our duty to make state laws the rule of our decision, unless they are repugnant to the constitution, laws or treaties of the United States. The preamble to the act of 6th April last, contains a plain declaration, that \u201cno incorporation, though lawfully incorporated or constituted, can, in any ease, purchase lands within this state, either in its corporate name, or names of any person or persons whomsoever, for its use, directly or indirectly, without incurring the forfeiture of said lands to this commonwealth, unless said purchase be sanctioned and authorized by an act of the legislature thereof; but every such corporation, its feoffee or feoffees, hold and retain the same, subject to be divested or dispossessed at any time by the commonwealth, according to due course of law.\" P. L. 467, 468. On the other hand, we have the supreme law of the state in two constitutions, declaring \u2014 one, that the declaration of rights is hereby declared to be a' part of the constitution of the commonwealth, and ought never to be violated on any pretext whatever; the other, that every thing contained in the bill of rights is excepted from the general powers of government, and shall forever remain inviolate: among these rights are enumerated those of \u201call religious societies, or bodies of men heretofore united or incorporated for the advancement of religion and learning, or for other pious and charitable purposes, which shall be encouraged and protected in the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities and estates,\u201d &c., in the constitution of 1776; and \u201cthe rights, privileges, immunities and estates of religious societies and corporate bodies,\u201d are, by that of 1700. declared to remain as if the constitution had not been altered, and the first article pf the schedule expressly saves the rights of incorporations. ,\nWe have felt it our duty to consider the law of the state to be as thus declared and we have been unable to bring our minds to any other conclusion than that any English statute which impairs the right of any corporation to enjoy an estate for its own use, is entirely inconsistent with the usage and constitution of the state, and could never have been in force by adoption, without deranging the whole system of policy, built up by a uniform course of the common law, and legislation of the state for a century and a half. If, however, we have not succeeded to that extent, we apprehend there can be little doubt that these propositions may be considered as established: 1. That, construing the legislation of the state by the rules which have been applied to the 43 Eliz., the statutes which would prevent the effectuation of any objects declared lawful, and by any disposition made valid and confirmed by law, must be considered as repealed so far as they embrace these objects and dispositions. 2. That conveyances and devises of land for religious, charitable, literary and public purposes, must be taken to be, within the meaning of the act of the 6th April, 1833, a purchase \u201csanctioned and authorized by an act of the legislature.\u201d 3. The constitution is an act of the supreme legislature of the state, which authorizes all societies or bodies of men, united or incorporated. to hold and enjoy to themselves, and in their own names and right; and the acts of 1730, 1818 and 1825, are legislative sanctions of their right to hold and enjoy lands, money and chattels for all these purposes.\nWe should have rested satisfied with results so satisfactory to our minds as these, if they had not been in some respects \u2022 at variance with the understanding\u2019of the supreme, court of the state, as to the law of mortmain, and the decision of the court in Baptist Association v. Hart [4 Wheat. (17 U. S.) 31], Opposed to such authority, it would have been our duty to have surrendered our own judgment, unless we had found it supported by the constitutions of the state, and the United States. Bound to decide on the laws of a state, as the courts of a state do, we must look to that which is supreme, as the only rule of our decision, where its language is plain; in its application to this case, it cannot be mistaken, nor can we overlook the first amendment to the constitution of the United States, which, in our opinion, wholly prohibits the action of the legislative or judicial power of the Union on the subject matter of a religious establishment, or any restraint on the free exercise of religion. We know of nothing which would so directly tend to infringe this prohibition as a law to declare that no religious society sliould be capable of enjoying land for the purposes of sepulture, worship or charity, without a license from the state; if the legislature can seize it as forfeited, they may impose the most effectual restraint on religious worship, by taking from the society the ground whereon, and the building in which they celebrate it; and no preference of modes of worship can be so repugnant to the rights of conscience and equality of religious right, as to license one society to do what they prohibit to another. With such rules for our guide, we could follow no other.\nThe objection to the devise of the eight acre lot is thus narrowed to the want of residence of some of the members of the yearly meeting in the state. This is founded on the act of 1730, which is confined to religious societies within the province. In the case of Methodist Church v. Remington, 1 Watts, 218, the supreme court say, \u201cIf the trust before them is to be sustained only by the enabling provisions of the law of 1730, it must fall: on the other hand, it is fair to say, that, though it derives no support from the statute, it is not necessarily prohibited by it; for it is an undoubted rule of construction, that an affirmative statute such as this, does not take away the common law, and there was certainly no absolute prohibition of such a trust by the common law, or any previous statute.\u201d The objection is therefore not sustained by this decision, still less by the opinion in the case of Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 27-29, where the court declared that a devise in Virginia to a charity in Pennsylvania would have been good if the plaintiffs had been capable of taking; and it is in direct opposition to the common law in relation to bequests of personal pi-operty for charitable purposes, to be expended in Ireland (1 Brown, Ch. 274); Scotland (1 Brown, Ch. 571; Amb. 236; 14 Ves. 537; 16 Ves. 337); or for the support of a bishop in America (1 Brown, Ch. 444), all of which have been held to be good. 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 500-502. Append. The yearly meeting of Philadelphia is a Protestant religious society, which has existed from the settlement of the colony, with known and recognized capacity of taking and enjoying property, according to the law and usage of the province and state, as well as the principles of the common law. They must be considered as a body politic or corporate by prescription, possessing and enjoying the franchise of succession, with the same rights of property as a natural person does by inheritance. We cannot impair the rights of the body united by their franchises, by inquiring into the separate capacity of its component members. They might be in part persons who could not hold for their separate use; but that would not change the character of the society, nor affect their constitutional rights as a body united for the purposes of religion and charity, located within the state; and, as such, they would come within the equity, if not the words, of the law of 1730. Be that as it may, they cannot be excluded from the protection of the constitution and usage, in the absence of any law requiring the residence of all its members within the state, or any rule of the common law, which imposes any disability upon the citizens of one state holding property in any other state, as its own citizens may do. The objection to the bequests of money to the Quaker societies in Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, and to the citizens of Winchester, assumes a different shape. Their alleged incapacity arises from their being composed wholly of the residents of other states, which must be tested by the la-w of the domicil of the testatrix. There is none which denies to the citizens of other states any rights of property which can be enjoyed by the citizens of this state under its constitution and laws, which declare them inherent in all persons. The laws for the enforcing the execution of trusts extend to all \u201cpersonal property vested in any person or persons, to be applied by them to any religious, literary or charitable use or uses,\u201d and the cestui que trust, or other person interested in the execution of the trust may apply to the courts of the state to compel the trustees to account, or to prevent the failure of the trust.\nThe constitution of the United States declares, that \u201cthe citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states;\u201d this instrument was adopted by the same power which established the constitutions of the several states, and is a part of the supreme law of each, as fully as if it was incorporated in its body. We must take it therefore as a grant by the people of the state in convention, to the citizens of all the other states of the Union, of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of this state; no law of the state has given it any construction which in any way restricts its operation, and it is not the duty of any federal court to so expound the constitution as to weaken the bond existing between the states which have established a \u201cgeneral government of the Union,\u201d a federal government of these states, by restraining the grants of rights or powers within limits narrower than the tenor and purport of the words used, according to their common acceptation. \u201cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect, and therefore such a construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it.\u201d [Marbury v. Madison] 1 Cranch [5 U. S.] 174-176. This clause is copied from the fourth article of the old confederation, and is one of the most important inthe whole instrument; it becomes senseless if it is not applied to the rights of property. The political rights of the citizens depend on the laws of the respective states (article 1, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, Const. U. S.), rights accruing by contract cannot be impaired in their obligation by state laws (article 1, \u00a7 10), and personal rights are protected by the 2d and 3d clauses of section 9, art. 1, of the constitution, and the 9th amendment; leaving no subject on which this clause can operate except property. The words \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d relate to the rights of persons, place or property; a privilege is a peculiar right, a private law, conceded to particular persons or places (7 Day, Com. Dig. 113, tit. \u201cPrivilege,\u201d A), whereby a particular man, or a particular corporation, is exempted from the rigor of the common law (Cow. Inst. tit. \u201cPrivileges\u201d), as converting aliens into denizens, whereby some very considerable privileges of natural born subjects are conferred upon them, or erecting corporations, whereby a number of private persons are united and knit together, and enjoy many liberties, powers and immunities in their political capacity, which they were utterly incapable of in their natural (1 Bl. Comm. 272). Among the privileges of the citizens of every state, is that of exemption from the law of alienage, though not born in the state; and every body of private persons united or incorporated have the franchise and immunity of enjoying estates in succession in this state; these are exemptions from the rigor of the common law, which the citizens of other states may enjoy in this, as fully as the citizens of this state can. We can therefore make no distinction between these bequests and those to societies located in the state; the disability of alienage cannot be applied to the citizens, societies or corporations of other states, and they may enjoy property as it can be enjoyed of right by those which are within the state.\nThe next questions that arise on this will, are the uses for which the various dispositions are made. As the supreme court have declared it a settled point, that the 43 Eliz. is not in force, we must endeavor to'ascertain from other sources, what uses are pious and charitable, as distinguished from those which are deemed superstitious or otherwise invalid. The general course of the law of England, as to the transmission of property, was declared, in the charter to Penn, to be the rule in the colonies, till altered or repealed, and the common law was recognized by the acts of 1718 and 1777 as in force, as well as such statutes as had been adopted. It is also a conceded principle, \u201cthat the colonists take with them such laws of the mother country as are useful and suited to their condition.\u201d 1 Jour. Cong. 27. It will be necessary, therefore, to trace the law of charities through the English statutes which preceded the 43 Eliz. as well as the common law, so as to determine what was its general course, how far it has been adopted in the written law of this state, or has been the basis of its usage independently of the enabling or enacting provisions of the 43 Eliz. and 7 & 8 Wm. III., assuming them not in force as adopted statutes. The following statutes on the subject come strictly within the description of the supreme court of the United States, in [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 31; they embrace cases within the statutes of mortmain, and gifts to corporations, and are analogous to the 43 Eliz. in all their features; so that there can be no reason for not giving them the same effect and construction as have been given to that statute.\nThe following are uses declared to be pious and charitable, by a series of statutes commencing in 1285, and affirmative of the common law: The statute 13 Edw. I. c. 41, enumerates the maintenance of a chantry, lights 'in a church, divine service and alms. Keb. St. 49; 1 Ruffh. St. 106; Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 465; 2 Co. Inst. 467. The statute 17 Edw.

The maintenance and relief of the poor in houses of (correction, impotent and maimed soldiers (29 Eliz. c. 6, \u00a7 7; Keb. St. 894; 2 Ruffh. St. 656; 35 Eliz. c. 1; Keb. St. 907; 2 Ruffh. St. 672), and hurt and maimed soldiers and mariners (Keb. St. 911; 2 Ruffh. St. 676). The maintenance of houses of correction, abiding houses, and stocks and stores therefor. 35 Eliz. c. 7; Keb.

The 43 Eliz. c. 4, enumerates twenty-one cases as classed by Lord Coke, in 2 Co. Inst. 711, which were all comprehended in preceding statutes or the cases above referred to, either in express or general terms.\nThis review exhibits a striking coincidence between the general course of the laws of England and Pennsylvania, in the designation by both of what are deemed and recog-nised to be the uses and purposes of piety and charity, protected and encouraged during the most intolerant times. The same coincidence will appear in tracing to their origin in the British statutes, and decisions of their courts, the rules and principles upon which donations for such uses have been construed and governed, as well as the remedies provided for their enforcement. The statute 17 Edw. II (De Terris Templai\u2019iun}), established and ordained as law forever, that lands which had been given and enjoyed for pious and charitable uses, should not escheat to the king or mesne loi\u2019ds of whom they were holden, on the extinction of the order of Templars, by whom they were holden for such uses. That they should be given to other men of holy religion, to the end that they may be charitably disposed of to godly uses. \u201cSo always that the godly and worthy will of the givers be observed, performed and always religiously executed.\u201d Keb. St. 86. 87; 8 Coke, 131b; 10 Coke, 34b; Co. Inst. 431. 432; 3 Coke. 3b; 7 Coke, 13a. The 37 Hen. VIII. c. 4, and 1 Edw. VI. c. 14, directed and empowered the king to dispose to the good, virtuous and godly uses specified in those acts, such parts of the suppressed lands, or their rents and profits, as had before been given to such purposes and misapplied. Also to dispose, change and alter donations given for superstition, to pious and godly uses, or to direct it to be done by the commissioners. The commissioners were directed to inquire what property had been given by deed or will to poor persons intended to have continuance forever out of the chantry lands, and to make such assignment thereof, that the money should be paid to them according to the conveyance or will of the donor, and that all charges on those lands for charitable or pious uses, should be paid by the king\u2019s receiver. Sections 12, 13. The commissioners were directed to execute their commission favorably and beneficially towards such uses and purposes, and their acts so made were declared as valid as if done by an express act of parliament. Keb. St. 636-644. The proviso in the fifth section of 39 Eliz. c. 5, prohibited the diversion of the funds of any hospital to any other purposes than those appointed, and declared that such construction should be put upon the act as should be most favorable to the maintenance of the poor, and repressing all evasions of the act. 2 Co. Inst. 721. 722. The commissioners were directed to make such orders and decrees as the said good and charitable uses may be fully observed in most full, ample and liberal sort, which not being contrary to the orders, decrees and statutes of the donors or founders, shall stand good according to their tenor and purport. 39 Eliz. c. 6; 4 Co. Inst. 167. The laws for confirming patents and grants from the crown, declared them to be good and available according to their tenor and effect, their words and purport, and to be expounded most beneficially for the patentee, without license, confirmation or toleration; any misnomer, misrecital or misdescription of the premises, or a corporation. or any lack of attornment, livery of seisin, or misnaming any person or body politic, to the contrary, notwithstanding. 18 Eliz. c. 2; 43 Eliz. c. 1; Keb. St. 852, 935; 2 Ruffh. St. 612, 702.\nThese statutes were evidently the models from which the colonial acts of 1705, for confirming deeds, wills, and sales under acts of assembly, and the law of 1711, confirming patents, were drawn: the rejected law of 1712, in relation to religious societies, contains a most admirable summary of the effect of the general course of the statutes of England, as they had been construed by courts of equity; and the powers conferred on the colonial courts by the acts of 1700 and 1710, show the intention of the legislature, that they should be exercised to the same extent and in the same manner as they were by the high court of chancery in England. It is. indeed, impossible to compare the laws of the two countries on the subject of charities, without being struck with the strong analogy between them; the substance of the statute and common law of England was adopted in the early colonial laws, entered into the custom of. the province, and will be found, condensed in a few words in the 45th section of the constitution of 1770, with this marked difference, that what the 43 Eliz. has done by implication and the construction given by courts, the constitution has done by a direct affirmative declaration of- rights. What was left imperfect was finished by the law of 1777, by expressly restoring the common law, repealing all laws inconsistent with the rights declared in the constitution, and declaring all colonial laws then in force and consistent with it to remain in force; this was going farther than the words of the 43 Eliz., which contained no repealing clause. The law of 1791, giving the powers of self-incorporation to all religious, literary and charitable societies, was an improvement upon the pattern of 39 Eliz. c. 5; and the laws for the execution of trusts was an adoption of the whole course of chancery, in administering trusts for the use of charities; so that we may safely conclude that the English system of charities, as it was at tlie settlement of the colony, has become naturalized here, not. only as to the principles of equity applied to the 43 Eliz., but the -substance and effect of the enabling provisions of all the statutes, including those of Elizabeth, by which the common law as to charities was restored in England, and brought here by the colonists unincumbered with restrictions.\nThe course of the law of England providing remedies for the enforcement and sup pressing the abuses of charities, are next to be considered. The statute 13 Edw. I. c. 41, gave the following remedies where the lands were aliened: If the king is the founder, he shall seize and hold the lands, and the purchaser shall lose his money; if a private person is the founder, he or his heir shall have his writ to recover the same land in demesne; if the lands are not aliened, but the alms withdrawn for two years, he shall have an action by writ of cessavit.

Co. Litt. 95b, 95a. By the 37 Hen. VIII. all lands held by hospitals, chapels, &c., which came within the purview of the laws for the suppressions of the church lands, were placed under the supervision of the court of augmentations, who decided exclusively all cases concerning them, as well as charities charged upon them, where the king was concerned or could be prejudiced; but all controversies between subjects were to be decided by the courts of common law. Keb. St. 608, 609; 2 Ruffh. St. 371. All copy-held lands, and all lands held by the license, assent, grant or confirmation of the king, were excepted from the operation of the law. By the 39 Eliz. c. 4, the chancellor was directed to appoint commissioners, to examine into the donations made for certain charitable uses, and correct their misemploy.ment. Keb. St. 920; 2 Ruffh. St. 687. The 39 Eliz. c. 6, directed- commissioners to be .appointed, to inquire-of land and goods given to any charitable uses, which had been mis-employed, and to reform and correct their abuses. The party deeming himself aggrieved. may complain to the chancellor, who shall judge thereon according to equity.' 4 Co. Inst. 167. This act was repealed by the 43 Eliz. c. 9, but the proceedings under it were confirmed (Keb. St. 648), the adoption of the 43 Eliz. c. 4, as a substitute for it, having made it inoperative. These statutes formed the law of charities in England before the 43 Eliz., and made a system which .has received but little improvement, either by that or any subsequent statutes; the rules of their construction adopted by all the courts of England, have ever been of the most liberal tendency, to establish charities and correct the abuse or diversion of the funds devoted to their support.\nThe course of the common law on charitable and pious donations is in accordance with the spirit of the statutes before recited, and the rules established for their construction. It is an admitted principle, that the personal property of decedents was disposable to pious uses, for the good of the soul of the deceased; the children and kindred had claims upon the trustees, but came in under the title of charity; the distribution was made by the ordinary at his discretion, to charitable uses in particular, or for the good of the soul of the deceased, according to the circumstances of .the estate. 2 Bl.

A testator by will, directed lands which were devisable by custom, to be sold by his executor, and the money to be distributed for the good of his soul; the executor held the land for two years without a sale, which the court held to be a breach of the intention of the testator, and they construed the will so as to make a condition, as such appeared to be the intention, the heir entered for the breach and recovered. 38 Ass. pl. 3; Lib.

The king gives land to the good men of D. which was no corporation before, rendering a certain rent, and the residue to repair a bridge, the king released the rent, which being the cause of their corporation, would seem to have determined it, yet for the preservation of the charitable use, they should continue a corporation for that purpose only. Duke, Char. Uses (by Bridgman) 134, cites 40 Ass. 26. A gift to a parish for a charitable use. by deed, is void, but a devise by good will is good, and the church-wardens and overseers shall take in succession. Id. Land was devised in the church of St. Andrew in Holborn, which was not capable of taking and holding in mortmain, but the court on an \u00e9x gravi querela brought by the parson to execute the devise (Fitzli. Nat. Brev. 441, L), awarded it to him, considering it to be the intent of the will, that the parson should have it, and not the church, and construed the words so as to preserve the intent; and not to destroy it; decided 21 Rich.

In 4 & 5 Phil. & M., a devise was made of lands to Trinity College and their successors for ever, for founding grammar schools for poor scholars, and held good by the equity of 1 & 2 Phil. & M. c. 8, which suspended the statutes of mortmain for twenty years. Dyer, 255b, pl. 7; 1 Coke, 25, 26, decided in 8 & 9 Eliz. C. B. Lands devised to employ the profits to find a priest to celebrate mass for the good of the soul of the testator, and other souls, as long as the laws of the land would suffer it; and if the laws prohibited it, then to the use of all the poorest people in six parishes, with power to the devisees to dispose of the profits at their pleasure to any of these purposes \u2014 the devise was held good, and not to be within any of the statutes. And. 43; Cro. Car. 108; 2 Ch. Cas. 18a, decided 3 Eliz.

The same will contained another devise in trust \u2014 that a preacher shall be found forever to preach the word of God in the church of St. Mary, in Thetford, four times a year, at ten shillings a sermon. Both clauses of the will were adjudged good, by the barons of the exchequer and the judges of the IC. B. who, after \u201coften argument, agreed, that the 23 Hen. VIII. c. 10, was to be taken to extend only to superstitious uses, by the words of it, in the very body of the act, and at the beginning, as by the time it was made \u2014 for at this time they began to have respect to the ruin of the authority of the pope and the dissolution of the abbeys, ehauntries and the like.\u201d Gibbons v. Maltyard, Poph. 6-8, adj. 34 & 35 Eliz. So of a devise for a free school, and the support of a master thereof, and certain alms-men and alms-women forever; the devise was held to be valid, though it did not take effect, owing to the breach of the condition on which it was made to depend. Porter\u2019s Case, 1 Coke, 22-25, 34 & 35 Eliz. in exchequer. In the case of Mayor, etc., of Reading v. Lane, a devise was made to the poor people maintained in the hospital of St. Leonard\u2019s, in Reading; the objection to the devise was, that the poor aot being incorporated, were not capable of holding lands, but it was decreed, that as the plaintiffs were a corporation capable of holding lands in mortmain and governed the hospital, the land should be assured to them for the use declared in the will. Toth. 7; 42 Eliz. lib. A, fol. 706; Toth. 32; Duke,. Char, Uses (by Bridgman) 134b, 361.\nCharities have always been favored in the law, by excepting them, when fastened on lands, from ordinary rules; where they are charged with services for the advancement of religion or justice, works of devotion, piety or charity, although the lord purchases parcel, yet the entire services remain. 6 Coke, 2a, 36 Eliz., in the court of wards. As, to make a bridge or beacon, repair a highway (6 Coke, 1b, 2a), to marry poor virgins, to find a preacher in a church, or the ornaments of a church (6 Coke, 2a), or to bind a poor boy an apprentice, or to feed a poor man. Co. Litt. 149a. The law was considered so well settled that Lord Coke, in 34 & 35 Eliz., states, unqualifiedly, that any man at this day may give lands in trust for any charitable use, to any person or persons and their heirs. 1 Coke, 26b; Sheph. Abr. 1066. They are prohibited by no statute, and none were ever intended to overthrow works of charity, but to prohibit their abuse. Co. Litt. 342a. The statutes of superstition did not extend to ' corporations, which were not both religious and ecclesiastical. 2 Coke, 48, 49. Gifts to lay hospitals remained valid; bishops, deans and chapters, parsons, vicars, abbots, churchwardens, &c., could hold lands notwithstanding the statutes of mortmain, as they were not dead persons in law, but had a capacity to grant or-to hold land, to sue and be sued. 1 Bl. Comm. 472-475 ; 2 Bl. Comm. 109. Though they were religious persons, they were also secular, in which capacity, they were considered as natural persons, or bodies politic, and could purchase and hold lands (Co. Litt. 94a, b; Perk. \u00a7\u00a7 31, 35, 55, 51), before the statutes of mortmain, and can now hold them in all cases where other corporations can. The capacity existed at common law and was not taken away by the statutes of mortmain, where the uses and purposes were declared good by the statutes providing a remedy, or correcting abuses, which in the language of the supreme court, removed all obstructions and disabilities which in any way prevented the donation from taking effect, and restored them to their common law capacity. [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 31. Charities were thus left free for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the respective courts, who in all cases gave effect to the disposition of a testator, whenever his intention was ex pressed, or could be collected from tbe will, notwithstanding any defect in form, or tbe want of naming or designating an object to take; they would give it locality, and application to those persons or bodies wbo were capable, if they could by any reasonable in-tendment be brought within the devise. As, in the Church of Holborn Case, they shifted the devise from the church to the parson, because the church could not hold in mort-main, but as the endowment of a vicar or parson was good by 15 Rich. II., and divine service by 13 Edw. I. and by 17 Edw. II. it was awarded to him, and he held an inheritance in right of the church as a capable person, the church in effect holding for his use; so, in the Reading Case, they shifted the devise from the poor of the hospital, to the corporation which governed it.\nThe law looks to the substance of the gift, and, in favor of religion, vests it in the party capable of taking it, \u2014 [Town of Pawlet v. Clark] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 329, \u2014 but without the right to alien it. Wing. Mas. 341, pl. 26. This consists in the enjoyment of the thing given according to the intent of the donor. Courts of common law and equity, were astute in devising means of giving it application and effect; whenever the instrument would pass the legal estate, either to the trustee or cestui que trust or use, they' supported the charity; the mode of establishment, or the distribution, was a circumstance in which they would relieve, according to their respective powers, against any defects in the disposition by will or deed. Their action on charities was not, by any authority assumed from the necessity of the case, but the positive directions of the statutes, to execute and religiously observe the will of the donor, in the most ample and liberal sort, notwithstanding any defects or failures therein; the same rules were prescribed to the special tribunals and courts under whose governance charities were placed, and were applied as liberally in favor of a subject against the king, as between private persons. A donation to a charitj', therefore, could only fail for want of a capable object, where there was neither a devisee to use, nor in trust, nor a cestui que use, capable of holding; they took effect whenever a trust was created and vested in any body or person who was named, described or could be brought within the scope of the will, and was capable of holding either as cestui que trust or trustee. The eases in which these principles were established, were decided before the 43 Eliz., on prior statutes, or the rules of the common law; they have been approved and acted on by the supreme court of this state, in 17 Serg. & R. 91; 1 Penn. 51; and by the supreme court of the United States, in [Terrett v. Taylor] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 43, 53; [Town of Pawlet v. Clark] Id. 328; [Mason v. Muncaster] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 455-464; [Beatty v. Kurtz] 2 Pet. [27 U. S.) 582; [Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor] 3 Pet. [2S U. S.] 119; [City of Cincinnati v. White] 6 Pet. [31 U. S.] 437; and the practical rules of construing the statutes of charities, as laid down in [Trustees of Philadelphia Baptist Ass\u2019n v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 31, are those which are to be found in cases not affected by the 43 Eliz., as well as those within it.\nThe remedies for evasions of the statutes and the abuse or misemployment 'of charitable donations, were administered with the same liberality by courts of law before as after that statute; the equitable powers conferred on the courts which were to decide on claims for charitable uses out of the king\u2019s lands or revenues, evinces the favorable disposition of the king and parliament in their favor. The benign principles of the common law were never displayed in brighter colors than in the course of the courts in the expositions of the statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI. for the suppression of superstitious uses and religious houses; if any want of liberality has appeared in later times to have entered into the jurisprudence of England on charities, it has risen from overlooking the provisions, or disregarding the principles, of their ancient statutes, which contain all that is valuable in the system, or adapted to the institutions of this country. The statutes of mortmain, of superstitious uses, and the restraints on corporations, are exceptions from the general course of the law of England; legal excrescences which were forced into it by the policy of the times, during the existence of tenures in chivalry, the persecution of the Catholic church, and latterly, since the statute 9 Geo. n., by a spirit of hostility to charitable donations by will, all of which are utterly repugnant to the spirit which pervades the common, the statute and the constitutional law of this state. There is no case reported as adjudged by courts of common law against a gift to charity, where words of inheritance were used in a devise to private persons in trust, or for a use, or to any body or society, which had a head known to the law, as being capable of holding for any other use, by statute, charter or usage, local custom or prescription. Perk. \u00a7 510, refers to a case decided in 26 Edw. III., of a devise of a remainder to the brotherhood of TVhiteaeres in London, to find a chaplain to pray for the soul of the testator; the brotherhood was not incorporated or enabled to purchase, and the remainder was held void. Perkins thus introduces this ease: \u201cBut the commonalty of a company which is not incorporated by the king\u2019s charter to purchase, &e., cannot take by devise.\u201d He states the case and concludes: \u201cAnd know, that the chief and supreme officers of the .fraternity, corporation or guild are taken in law for the best men,\u201d &e. These remarks lead to the ground of the decision. The devise was of a remainder, which could not vest without words of inheritance to private persons, or to a corporation by succession; in this case there being neither, the devise failed on the ground that the commonalty or brotherhood, having no politic capacity by means of a head or chief officer, could not hold an estate by succession, and no words of inheritance being used, the remainder in fe^e continued in the heirs of the devisor, according to the rules before laid down from Sheph. Touch. 235-237, etc. There was no franchise in the commonalty, from which a corporation could be presumed, as in the case from Duke, Char. Uses (by Bridgman) 134, decided in 40 Edw. III.; the statute of Rich. II., authorizing the endowment of a vicar or priest, had not been passed, and by the words of the devise, there was no ground to infer the intention to be that any church or parish should take or hold it, by a parson, overseer or church-warden; so that there was no circumstance on which the court could lay hold to take the estate from the heir at law and give effect to the devisees as in the cases referred to in [Town of Pawlet v. Clark] 9 Cranch [13 U. S.] 328, &c. A learned judge considers this to have been a case which could have been aided by the royal prerogative exercised by the court of chancery. [Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor] 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 142. But it appeal\u2019s to have been one where the king had no interest or claim by statute, prerogative or tenure; the devise not taking effect, the estate remained in the heir of~tho devisor. The charity was not extinct as in cases under the statute of Templars; it never existed, because there was no devisee in whom the remainder could vest; the king therefore could not make a new appointment by his sign manual (7 Coke, 36a), nor could a court of chancery disturb the course of the common law, on any ground of equity; such a devise would not be aided in equity under the 43 Eliz., unless the brotherhood could be considered as a corporation by prescription. by some franchise or right to unite them. This case therefore cannot be considered as at all in opposition to those which have been referred to.\nSo far as the common law could be settled by the repeated solemn adjudications of the courts of Westminster Hall, we thus find it established from the time of Edw. III., without any clashing decision. It only remained to add the sanction of parliament to these principles of the law of charity by a declaratory act to make them irrevocable. That was done in the Case of the Thetford School Devise, which had been held valid in the two preceding cases, in 34 & 35 Eliz., Cro. Eliz. 2SS, and Poph. 6-S. This devise was made in 9 Eliz.,-when the annual value of the land was \u00a335 per annum; it afterwards rose to \u00a3100; a private bill was exhibited in parliament (7 Jac. I.) for the erection of the school, &c., according to the will, on which two questions were moved: 1. Whether the preacher, school-master, usher and poor should have only the said certain sums appointed to them by the founder, or that the revenue and profit of the land should be employed to the increase of their stipend, &c. 2. If any surplusage remained, how it should be employed. The case was referred to the judges, and it was resolved, that the whole profits and revenue should be employed to the increase of the stipends, and if any sur-plusage remained it should be expended for the maintenance of a greater number of poor, and nothing should be directed to the use of the devisees, executors or heirs, or any private use, it appearing to be the intention of the testator to employ the whole in works of piety, charity, the maintenance and increase thereof; and the bill was passed accordingly. This was in accordance with the rule established in the statute de templar-ium, quoted by Lord Coke at the end of the ease; so always that thegodlyand worthy will of the donors, &c. (S Coke, 130b, 131b), which was not a new rule introduced into the law by the act passed for the Thetford school, but as declared by all the judges in the case of Sutton\u2019s Hospital, in 10 Jac. I., was declaratory and explanatory of the common law. 10 Coke. 30b, 34a. The right to take and hold the land devised for charitable uses with their increased revenues and profits being thus definitely settled by both the legislative and judicial power of the kingdom, it has never been questioned since the Case of the Thetford School, on which the statute 43 Eliz. had no bearing, and is not even referred to in the report of the proceedings in parliament, or the opinions of the judges, on the law of the case, as previously settled in Cro. Eliz. 288; Poph. 6-8.\nThe spirit of equity which pervaded the law of charities having been extended so as to bring within its protection not only the specific bequests of a testator, but the entire fund on which they were charged, it was not necessary for courts of equity to usurp any of the powers of a court of law, in order to effectuate a charitable donation, or to establish any rules or principles different from those on which the common law courts had acted with the sanction of parliament. Chancery had its appropriate jurisdiction over eases of fraud, accident and breach of trust, arising out of dispositions of property to purposes unconnected with charity; if the party had a right known to the law, but had no legal remedy, he could resort to the extraordinary powers of the court of chancery for relief, according to its usage and settled principles, which applied to charities as well as other subject matters of its cognizance. To have refused the same relief in the one case as the other, would have placed charities under the ban of the law of equity, though they were the favorites of the statute and common law: if there was anything in the nature of charities, which would call for or justify the 'withholding equitable relief for matters not cognizable at law, without special authority by statute, it would have appeared in the course of the law for more than three hundred years before the 43 Eliz. Its history exhibits no feature of the hind; on the contrary, it exhibits the most convincing evidence, that it was peculiarly the duty of courts of equity to obey the injunctions of the statutes, to execute the intention of the donors and founders of charities, and not to suffer their donations to fail of effect or to be abused when their intention could be ascertained. The proceedings of courts of equity are very imperfectly reported prior to the Restoration; some few cases are interspersed among the common law reports, but they are mostly referred to in the short notes of Carey and Tothill, which do not give the reasons of the court for their decisions; we are therefore left to infer the principles which governed them from their acts, thus briefly noted, and the elementary writers in -or near the time, who have given the results in general terms. Enough, however, can be collected to show, satisfactorily, that the general course of equity before the 43 Eliz., in all cases of charities, was according to rules and principles as well settled and defined as on any other subjects, and was the basis on which the law now stands on the construction of that statute.\nThe jurisdiction of chancery over trusts was never questioned by the most strenuous advocates of the common law. 2 Bacon, Abr. 22; Harg. Law Tracts, 431; Treat. Eq. 523; 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 764. It was coeval with their existence, and its exercise was indispensable in cases where the feoffor, having parted with his whole estate, had no control over it at law; but being made in trust and on confidence, the powers of a \u2022court of equity were necessary to deal with-the corrupt conscience of the feoffee who refused to execute the trust. The cases of its exercise from the time of Hen. VI. are numerous. 4 Co. Inst. 84; Gilb. Ch. 19, 259; Bohun, C. C. 6; 1 Hu, Ab. 400; Lil. Pr. Reg. 57, 58; 1 Rolle, Abr. 374; Mitf. Pl. 120, 121. The equity and use of the land being to go according to conscience, the subpoena for relief herein in this court is given accordingly. Sheph. Abr. 201, pi. 13, 199. Chancery would not only compel the performance of the trusts specified, but compel the feoffee to do any other acts for the benefit of the feoffor or cestui que use in a deed or obligation. Brown, Conscience, 5, 9, 27, fol. 162-3. Carey, 13, 20, cites cases from the time of Hen. VI. and Edw. IV. It also remedied grievances arising from acts done which were prohibited by statute, but for which there was no remedy by the common law, as waste in certain cases. Car. 26; Moore, p. 554, pl. 748; Ponbl. Eq. 32.\nAll cases of covin and fraud were cognizable in equity, from the earliest times. Toth. 62; Car. 20, 25, 26; 4 Vin.

The specific performance of. contracts made by competent \u2018parties, on good consideration, were also decreed against the party, his heir, and those claiming under him with notice. Toth. 3, 4, 62, 69, 70, 92, 123, 106; Cro. Car. 110; Fonbl. Eq. 5; 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 772. \u2018\u2019Equity will aid the perfecting of things well meant and on good consideration,\u2019\u2019and\u201cwill reform in conscience that which is badly done,\u201d by supplying defects. Car. 23, cites 9 Hen. VIII.; Max. Eq. 57; 10 Hen. VII. 201, pl. 13. It will prevent a contract from failing for want of a circumstance or ceremony (Carey 24, 25), as livery of seisin, attornment, surrender of a copyhold, enrolment of a deed, a misrecital (Toth. 62; 12 Eliz. 70; 38 Eliz.), or a misnomer of a corporation (Toth. 131, 32 Eliz.; Car. 24, 44; Bohun, C. C. 7; Max. Eq. 57; Toth. 27, 33 Eliz.; Sheph. Abr. 194, 195; Hob. 124; Cro. Eliz. 106). Though an estate cannot be created by covenant by law, it shall be made good in chancery. Toth. 84, 40 Eliz. So of a lease made to commence during the existence of a former one which would make it void at law. Toth. 127, 25 Eliz.; S. P., 128, 40 Eliz. So where an exception was intended to be made, but it was omitted by mistake, chancery supplied it. Toth. 131, 37 Eliz. So where a devise was void at law, by misrecital of a grant and by reason of an attornment (Toth. 79, 38 Eliz.), or a copyhold surrendered at a court held out of the manor where the land lay (25 Eliz., Toth. 45), or a conveyance sought to be avoided for want of livery (Toth. 42, 41 Eliz.), chancery will relieve, though the defect would be fatal at law. Where courts of equity act upon instruments to take effect in the lifetime of the party who makes an agreement for a valuable consideration, they will make it as effectual for the purposes intended as the party had power to do. Sugd. Pow. 361. And in dispositions by will, they will help against all defects which the testator had power to remedy. 1 Mad. Ch. 47, 49. The principle on which they act is, that where the parties interested intended to contract a perfect obligation, though by mistake or accident, they omit the set forms of words, so that there is no legal remedy, yet they are bound in natural justice to stand to their agreement, and \u201cwhere there is substance, the law will apply the words to the intent, though they sound differently\u201d (Tr. 14; 1 Fonbl. Eq. 147; Plowd. 140, 141), the imperfect execution of the contract not affecting the equity raised by the agreement (1 Fonbl. Eq. 37, 40, 41). Equity, therefore; will supply any defects of circumstances in conveyances (1 Fonbl. Eq. 38), where there is an intent to make a better assurance (Carey, 44).\nIt has never been pretended that the course of equity on these subjects was regulated qr in any way affected by the 43 Eliz.; it was founded on principles which were the origin and foundation of its jurisdiction, and became gradually developed according to the exigency of the times. There is no reason which would prevent their application to charities in all cases between subjects, before the 43 Eliz. in the same manner as after; nor is there to be found in any decision or authority, other than the late dicta denying it: so far as any traces of its jurisdiction over charities are to be found in the books, it seems to have been under the three heads of fraud, trust and accident, and exercised without any doubt of the power in all cases where either circumstance existed. In Toth. 58, a case is reported as having been decided in 36 & 37 Hen. VIII. in which the court of chancery decreed lands to the mayor and burgesses of Gloucester, to whom they had been devised for the use of a school and other purposes. When a donor appointed lands or goods to be sold to maintain a charitable use, and did not appoint by whom the sale should be made, it was decreed to be made by persons named by the commissioners, and the money employed to maintain a charitable use according to the donor's intent. Toth. 30; Duke. Char. Uses (by Bridgman) 3G0, 41 Eliz. In Francis Moore's reading on the 43 Eliz., various cases are referred to which show clearly that charities stood upon the same footing in equity before the statute as they have done since. If a man devise that the executors of his wife shall pay money to be lent to young tradesmen, it is void, because he cannot charge the executors of his wife; but assets belonging to the husband were decreed to be liable to the charitable use. Duke, Ghar. Uses (by Bridgman) 13G, 40 Eliz. Land sold in confidence to perform a charitable use, which the bargainer declared by his will, the bargain was never enrolled, yet the lord chancellor decreed the heirs should sell the land, to be disposed according to the use. This decree was made 34 Eliz.. before the statute of charitable uses, and \u201cwas made upon ordinary judicial equity in chancery, and therefore it seems the commissioners upon this statute may decree as much in the like case.\u2019\u2019 If a reversion be granted to a charitable use, the particular tenant shall be bound to attorn by the decree of the commissioners, and it was said there are precedents in chancery where the lord chancellor had decreed and compelled the tenant to attorn. Sir Thomas Bromly decreed and compelled the terre tenant to give seisin of a rent seek to the intent the party may bring an assize. Duke, Char. Uses (by Bridgman) 163.\nFrom these cases, and the remarks of Sir Francis Moore, it seems that the course of the commissioners and the chancellor, under the statute, was taken from the previous rules of judicial equity, which were settled long before its adoption. It was penned by him by order of the house of commons (Duke, Char. Uses, by Bridgman, 122), which gives great weight to any opinion expressed by him, and to cases which he adopts as law. He says, no use shall be taken by equity to be a charitable use, within the meaning of the statute, if it be not within the meaning and words of the statute; but the words may be construed by equity, as the repairs of churches extend to all convenient ornaments, and convenients for the administration of divine service. A gift of lands \u201cto maintain a chaplain or minister to celebrate divine service, is neither within the letter nor meaning of this statute, for it was of purpose omitted in the penning of the act, lest the gifts intended to be employed upon purposes grounded upon charity might, in change of times, contrary to the minds of givers, be confiscated into the king\u2019s treasury; for religion being variable, according to the pleasure of succeeding princes, that which at one time is held for orthodox, may, at another, be accounted superstitious, and then such lands are confiscated, as appears by the statute of charities\u201d (1 Edw. VI. c. 14). The effect of this omission is not to make the devise void, but to except such cases from the jurisdiction conferred on the commissioners by the statute. It is the same as a proviso which declares that nothing in the act shall be construed to extend to college.?, &c., which is only to exempt them from being reformed by commission. Hob. 136. So a gift for the maintenance of a chaplain or priest for divine service will be a charitable use, and in the direction of chancery, though not within the power of the commissioners, 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. N. 10, p. 609, and cases cited. As the statute gives to the chancellor no judicial power, except by appeal from the decree of the commissioners, it follows, that wherever he exercises any jurisdiction over cases not within the statute, or excepted from the power of the commissioners, it is independent of the statute; yet the uniform course of equity in such cases has been to give relief by the same rules and principles as if the case had been included in its enumeration. The lord keeper and the judge decreed that money given to maintain a preaching minister was a charitable use, notwithstanding it is not warranted by the statute, and that the same shall be paid by the executor to such maintenance. Pember v. Inhabitants of Kingston, Toth. 34; 15 Car. I.; Duke. Char. Uses (by Bridgman), 381; Pensterd v. Pavier, Toth. 34. \u201cWhere an endowment was made for a vicar, but was void at law, by reason of some defects arising from the ignorance of the donor, it was decreed good in chancery. \u201cFor in cases of charitable uses, the charity is not to be set aside for want of every circumstance appointed by the donor, \u2014 if it should, a -great many charities would fail.\u201d Joyce v. Osborne, Nel. Ch. 40, 41; 15 Car. I. So, where by will a certain sum was charged upon land for a weekly sermon and lecture, it was objected, that the devise was void, \u201cbecause the ease was not in the statute,\u201d because \u201cno person was named.\u201d \u2014 \"iiart of the land was held per autre vie, and not devisable,\u201d \u2014 and, \u201cas the sermons bad been discontinued, therefore the annuity ought to cease;\u201d but tbe chancellor held them to be good. 2 Ch. Cas. 18, 19; S. P. 32. This principle has been followed up by various cases, in which devises to chaplains, ministers, preachers, vicars, &c., have been held good (1 Vin. Abr. 249; 2 Vern. 105; 3 P. Wms. 344; Swinb. 71) and chancery has decreed the execution of trusts in their favor, without any other authority than that on which they, through all time, acted on matters within their appropriate jurisdiction. 2 Fonbl. Eq. 210. It was strongly illustrated in a case decided immediately after the statute. In 11 Hen. VI. land was given with intent to find a chaplain to celebrate divine service, until the feoffor should procure a foundation, but was not so employed. The commissioners, under 39 Eliz., decreed the lands to the use, \u2014 the chancellor reversed their decree, because the use was not inquirable by them under the statute, but by his chancery authority he did decree the land according to the original use. Duke, Char. Uses (by Bridgman) 154; Carey, 39; 3 Jac. I. A decree was made for the heir at law, against certain feoffees who had lands conveyed to them to maintain scholars who should use holy orders. Crofts v. Evetts, Toth. 61, 62, 3 Jac. I., \u2014 though this case is not within the statute.\nThe general principle adopted in chancery, that the performance of a charitable use is equally if not more favored than the payment of debts (Duke, Char. Uses, by Bridgman, 13S, from Moore's Reading on the Statute, referred to as laid down in 42 Eliz.,) shows the reason of these decisions to be founded in general rules, to carry the intention of the party into effect, for all lawful objects, especially favored ones, as is forcibly expressed in a note in Tothill. of a case decided in 38 & 39 Eliz. \u201cThe law of God speaks for him, equity and good conscience speak for him, and the law of the land speaketh not against him.\u201d Toth. 12G. This is the basis of equity jurisdiction: and as there is no subject to which the rule would apply with more force than to charities, so it will be found, that it has been the uniform course of equity to support charitable donations in all cases where they are not prohibited by law; \u2014 the inquiry has been, not what uses were authorized, but only what forbidden. Courts of original jurisdiction have taken cognizance of cases excluded from the power of special tribunals, without any statutory authority, and have not considered charities to be excluded from the protection of the law of equity, because they were not made subject to the power of the commissioners under the 43 Eliz. It contains no provision which enlarges the jurisdiction of the chancellor, as a court of equity, or as acting in place of the king by his prerogative or personal jurisdiction; in the appointment of commissioners, he acts as a special officer, selected to perform the duty imposed by the statute; in sustaining appeals from the commissioners, he acts by the rules of equity and good conscience, and these are the only functions which he is to perform under the statute. Keb. St. 943, 944; 2 Ruffh. St. 708, 709. It is wholly silent as to a proceeding by original bill, between private parties, or by information of the attorney general, where the king is in any way concerned, or where the chancellor can act only by the sign manual of the king. It enumerates only twenty-one charitable uses, as classed by Dol'd Coke, in 2 Inst. 710, and prescribes only one rule to the commissioners in making their decrees: \u201cSo as the lands and money may be duly and faithfully employed to and for such of the charitable uses and intents before rehearsed respectively, for which they were given, limited, assigned or appointed, by the donors and founders thereof;\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhich decrees not being contrary to the orders, statutes or decrees of the donors or founders, shall, by the authority of the present parliament, stand firm and good, according to the tenor and purport thereof, and shall be executed accordingly, until the same shall be undone or altered by the lord chancellor,\u201d &c. 2 Co. Inst. 710. This is the substance of the recital and remedial part of this statute; and if the law of charity could be traced to no other source, the system must have remained not only very defective, but would have been extremely illiberal and contracted, if it had rested on the enacting or remedial provisions it contains, or its operation and effect had been confined to the enumerated cases. By recurring to the statutes heretofore noticed, and the decisions of courts of law and equity, before this statute, it will be found, that they comprehend forty-six specifications of pious and charitable uses, which were recognized as within the protection of the law, in which were embraced all that were enumerated in the 43 Eliz. The statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI.. for the suppression of superstition, protected more cases of charity, and prescribed more liberal rules for their establishment and maintenance, than 43 Eliz. The rules they prescribed to the commissioners, and the courts under which they were placed, are more definite and explicit in favor of charities, even where their establishment would prejudice the rights of the king, than this statute directs in cases between individuals.\nThe same remark applies to the statutes of 39 Eliz., and if a detailed comparison was made, exhibiting the system o\u00ed charities by the general course of tne law of England, as it stood before the 43 Eliz., and as it would appear from that statute taken alone, no jurist would hesitate in preferring the f\u00f3rmel-as the most perfect and liberal. The contrast would be striking indeed, if we expunge from the latter all which it adopts from former statutes and the common law; or if we take from the rules and principles which have governed its construction, as they are stated in the books to have been founded on its provisions, those which appear to have been finally settled and established previously; \u2014 this statute and the great system whieh has been supposed to have been built upon it, would lose its importance in the view of the profession. That branch of the personal or prerogative jurisdiction of the chancellor, which is exercised on the information of the attorney-general, by appointing a charitable donation to new objects, on the extinction of those to which it was originally devoted, will be found to be derived from the fundamental law of charities, established by the statutes of Templars (17 Edw. II.).\nThe altering and disposing to good and pious uses, donations originally made for purposes of superstition, is a provision of the 1 Edw. VI. The appointment of general and vague charities to definite objects results from the general direction of the statutes, prior to the 43 Eliz., to make such appointments, \u201cso that the will of the giver shall in all things always be faithfully observed and religiously executed\u201d (17 Edw. II.); and that the decrees \u201cshall be most beneficial in favor of the charities specified\u201d (1 Edw. VI.); so that the said charitable uses may be observed in the most liberal and ample sort (39 Eliz.). General charities are embraced in the 37 Hen. VIII. as \u201cgood, virtuous and charitable deeds;\u201d and in 1 & 2 Phil. & M., \u201cthe resuscitation of alms, prayer and example of good life;\u201d and in 39 Eliz. c. 6, \u201cother good, lawful and charitable purposes and intents;\u201d \u2014 they were also under the superintendence of the king, as parens patriae. So that in all these cases, the 43 Eliz. has no direct or indirect effect in giving any jurisdiction to the chancellor. The appropriation of the increased profits and revenues of land charged with a specific sum to charities, to the same objects as those specified; and the rule which prevents their going to the heir, or any other use than the charity, is founded on the statute of Templars, and the common law, as declared in 8 Coke, 131; 10 Coke, 30. The words \u201cgiven,\u201d \u201climited,\u201d \u201cappointed,\u201d \u201cassigned,\u201d were taken from the 1 Edw. VI. c. 14, and 37 Hen. VIII. c. 4 (2 Ch. Cas. 18). These are the words on which the effect of the statute has been mainly founded, and courts have extended them very far (P. C. 271); but their meaning is the same in all the statutes. An assignment of the suppressed lands to charitable uses by commissioners, under the statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 14, \u00a7 13, had the same effect as an act of parliament, and the final decree of the court of augmentations of the revenue, the court of wards, or exchequer, establishing a charity on the lands or revenues of the king, was conclusive on his rights, let them accrue from whatever source: it followed that such appointment, assignment or decree, by the authority of parliament, had all the effect of a charter, license, and non obstante statuto, or special incorporation.\nIndependent of any statutory jurisdiction, charities belonged to the king as parens pa-triae, and fell under the care of chancery by the same authority which they exercised over infants, idiots, lunatics and wards of the king, before the erection of the other courts to whom the powers of the chancellor were transferred. 2 Vern. 342; 2 P. Wms. 103-118; 1 Bl. Comm. 90-92; 2 Bl. Comm. 328; Gilb. Eq. 172. The erection of new courts, or the authority conferred on commissioners to do what had before belonged to the chancellor, virarte officii, or by sign manual, was therefore only a devolution of his powers on the other tribunals; not the creating of a new power not before in existence, nor was the effect of their acts any greater by their special authority than the decrees of the chancellor, in virtue of his inherent or prerogative jurisdiction. The law on this subject was so well settled that in the 43 Eliz. the attorney general, Coke, and the two chief justices, Popham, Sir Francis Moore, and Anderson, by command of Sir Thomas Egerton. keeper of the seal, reported the following resolutions, on divers points on the 39 Eliz. c. 6, directing commissioners to redress frauds and breaches of trust of lands and goods given to charitable uses. If the commissioners decree a lease or feoffment to be void, it is void in interest and estate. If the chancellor decrees it good, it is again good interest, but they thought that the chancellor could make no decree, unless the decree of the commissioners was against equity. That the commissioners could decree the payment of mesne profits received and mis-employed, as well as make orders for the future profits. That the word \u201cgiven,\u201d in the proviso excepting hospitals and towns corporate. extends to gifts after the statute, as well as to gifts before. That they could not by a decree, establish a corporation of churchwardens, or others, to take for a charitable use, but they could decree land to a capable body politic, without danger of mortmain, whether the land was held in capite or not, because the king is bound by the statute in that point. That they could appoint lands to natural persons, and their heirs to hold in continuance for charitable uses. That they had power to reform abuses in such corporations as were out of towns corporate, to add land to them, or make orders for them which should have the same effect, as parliament, by private acts of incorporation for charitable uses, gave, as to all things in which the law does not prescribe any special cause of favor. Moore, 559, 500, pl. 762; Moore, Abr. 158, pl. 727. There can be no danger or error in taking the resolution of these common law lawyers as the settled rule by which charities were administered up to this time. There certainly is none in following the statutes which are yet in force, and the adjudications of courts which are recognized as law to this day, as the \u201cgeneral course of the law of England.\u201d In thus divesting the 43 Eliz. of its borrowed words, uses and provisions, it will be found that there remains but one important office which it has performed by its exclusive operation in aid of donations to charities \u2014 that is, to remove the disability imposed on corporations by the statute of wills. In other respects, it can be considered only as an item in the legislature of England, which, taken in connection with the decisions of the courts, framed the general course of the law on the subject of charities, which had become well defined and systematized; so much so, that we find much less litigation on charities before the 43 Eliz. than immediately after-wards. This was the consequence of the repeal of the 39 Eliz. e. 6, and the very limited enumeration of uses in 43 Eliz., which compelled the courts virtually to re-enact it by construction. In addition to the preceding view of the jurisdiction of chancery over charities, there is a general principle of the. law of England peculiarly applicable to this subject.\nIt is provided by an old statute, that no man shall go from the king\u2019s courts without remedy for his right (13 Edw. I.. c. 50; Keb. St. 52; 1 Ruffh. St. 111, 112); and was declared as a rule of equity by the chancellor in 4 Hen. VII. fol. 5; Bohun, Ch. Cas. 3; 2 Co. Inst. 405-408, 485; 12 Coke, 114b; Hob. 63; 3 Bl. Comm. 52; 2 Day, Com. Dig. 340-368, 370; 1 Ch. App. 20, 48. The whole judicial power.of the kingdom is vested in the different courts (4 Co. Inst. 7071) and there can be no failure of justice by defects of courts, for when particular courts fail of justice, the general courts .shall give remedy. 4 Co. Inst. 213; 1 Bac. Abr. 554, 555; 12 Coke, 114. They are supreme within their respective jurisdictions, and that of equity extends to all rights recognized by the law for which there is no legal remedy, the cognizance of which has not been transferred to some other court. 4 Co. Inst. 84. The jurisdiction of chancery, according to equity and good conscience, extends to all cases cognizable In equity, and the party objecting to its exercise must show that some other court of equity has cognizance of the case. 4 Co. Inst. 82; 1 Bac. Abr. 560; Mitf. Pl. 183; Beames, 57, 91; 2 Vern. 483; 1 Vern. 59; 1 Ves. 204; 1 Dickens, 129. Its course is governed by usage, without any statutory restraint as to persons or the subject matter \u2014 except cases affecting the rights or prerogative of the crown, to which it is extended either by statutes or warrant from the king; but is not exercised in virtue of the equity powers of the court (4 Co. Inst. 79, 82; Bohun, Ch. Cas. 50; Hob. 63; 2 Atk. 553; 3 Atk. 635); or the 43 Eliz.; 2 Co. Inst. 552. In acting on cases between subjects the jurisdiction exercised is that which is inherent in chancery as a court of equity, depending on its usage, and co-existent with its existence, by the same rules as are prescribed to the chancellor on an appeal from a decree of the commissioners under the 10th section of the 43 Eliz., which adopted its old principles. It is the same jurisdiction which the constitution confers on the courts of the United States by the words \u201ccases in equity,\u201d and which the laws of this state of 1S25 and 1S2S confer on the state courts in cases of trust, \u201caccording to the powers and rules of a court of equity,\u201d which this court can exercise to the same extent as in England; subject only to tlie restriction of the 16th section of the judiciary act [1 Stat. 82], where there is a remedy at law. Baker v. Biddle [Case No. 764; Parsons v. Bedford] 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 446, 447; [Bank of Hamilton v. Dudley] 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 525, 526. It is therefore \"clear, that the extraordinary jurisdiction of chancery was always applicable to charities in England; whenever there-was a right to hold property for a charitable use, there was a remedy in the appropriate court, according to their respective jurisdiction, to be administered by its ordinary rules and principles without the aid of any new statute. It is also clear, that the personal or prerogative jurisdiction of the chancellor existed before the erection of the court of wards (2 Atk. 553), and that the court of chancery exercised its jurisdiction at large on cases of charitable uses before the statute, and that there may be a bill by information in that court founded on its general jurisdiction. 2 Ves. 327-329.\nThere is no case reported or referred to, wherein chancery has refused to sustain a bill or information for the establishment of a charity for the want of jurisdiction. There could be no failure of equitable relief in a proper case, either between a subject and the king, or subject and subject, for before the erection of the court of augmentations and wards the chancellor was invested with all the powers which were given to those courts which were most ample for all purposes of charities. The case of Reg. v. Porter, in 1 Coke, 22, has been considered as opposed to this position, and the importance given to it by the supreme court of the United States, in [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 33, 34, makes it necessary to bestow some attention upon it. The case is too familiar to the profession to be stated, but one historical fact is stated by the lord chancellor, in 3 Ves. 726, which fully accounts for the course of proceeding \u2014 the dev-isee \u201cinstead of performing the will made a long lease, and the mode taken to effectuate the charity was this \u2014 they found the heir at law, and he having entered, conveyed to the queen, by which means she had it in her power to establish the charity.\u201d The attorney general filed an information of intrusion in the exchequer against Porter, who was in possession under the devisee, on which there was a judgment in favor of the queen, which is equivalent to a recovery or possession, as the defendant in such cases is subject to a fine which he can avoid only by making terms. It only remained for the queen to grant a charter to effectuate the charity as she had the legal estate by deed from the heir, and possession of the land on which it was charged; and it was the most direct mode of doing it. In any other way the difficulty would have been great. There had been an adverse possession from the death of the testator, in 32 Hen. VIII. till the 34 Eliz., so that the heir could not have recovered possession by any other proceeding than a writ of right. If successful, he could establish the charity by his own deed, only in the grantees and their heirs, or in trustees for their use. To make a corporation, it would be necessary to apply to parliament, as in the case of the Thetford school, or to the queen for letters patents for at this time there was no power in commissioners by any statute to establish charities on any lands except those in the king\u2019s hands under the government of special courts. If the heir had refused, the interference of chancery would hare been necessary to give relief to the parties interested in the charity, if the difficulty of obtaining possession at law had been removed. By the special verdict, it appears that the testator had edified \u201cdivers meases, mansions and places convenient for a free school,\u201d &c., (1 Coke. 19b,) and the devise of the wharf and house was for \u201cthe maintenance of the premises in manner and form, as the said N. G. have kept and maintained the same, and as the same is now kept and maintained without any diminution in any wise.\u201d There was then a vested interest, a trust created and cestui que trust in existence, and the charity was fastened on the land into whosesoever hands it came. It was binding on the heir who entered for the condition broken \u2014 \u201che shall perform the use because he comes in upon confidence, and the condition was compulsory to perform the use.\u201d Moore, Char. Uses; Duke. Char. Uses (by Bridgman) 137, 138, 159-161.\nIf the powerful reasoning of the judges in the case of Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor's Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 119, 140, 145, 154, is applied to Porter\u2019s Case [supra], it is apprehended that there could be little doubt that the devise would have been carried into effect in a court of law, if the cestui que use of the charity had been in possession of the wharf and house; as the court of exchequer held the devise to be valid in law, and as the donor had an undoubted power over the estate, every principle and rule of equity would have induced a court of equity to compel the heir at law to have carried his intention into effect, by the exercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction over trusts. The queen by her purchase acquired only the right of the heir, she held it subject to the trust, and as the condition which created the trust appeared on the face of her title, the eestuis que trust could have had their remedy in the exchequer, by a bill or information in nature of a monstrans de droit, as fully as in the case of a charity charged upon the abbey lands by the 33 Hen. VIII. But no further proceeding was required after the adverse claim was removed; as the object was the establishment of the charity, no interference became necessarj', as the power of the queen was competent to do every act in order to carry the devise into complete effect; by the mode adopted all circuity was avoided, and the object completely effected, as soon as the queen obtained possession by removing the intruder. Plow. 561; Hardr. 460; 7 Day, Com. Dig. 83. The presumption of the want of any equitable remedy to establish and protect the charity, which has been drawn from the lapse of time from the death of the de-visor till the filing of the information, is not warranted by any thing which appears in the report of the case, and it is not to be expected that the collateral circumstances attending it can now be traced with accuracy; the one referred to in 3 Ves. 726. is satisfactory, and appears in the whole course of the argument by the counsel of the queen, to have been the only object of her interference. But whatever ground there may have been for such presumption, arising from the particular circumstances of Porter's Case, without referring to the general course of the courts of law and equity, or of the special courts or tribunals instituted by statutes prior to its decision; there certainly is the most abundant evidence that there was in some court a competent power to effectuate all lawful charities according to the intent of the donor. The statutes and adjudications referred to are conclusive to this point, and no presumption can be permitted to overthrow their authority, unless modern doubts shall be more respected than the ancient principles of the law which governed charities before the 43 Eliz., and which have continued to this day the rules by which courts of equity have proceeded in their administration in cases not within the words or equity of that statute, as well as those expressly excluded from its operations by provisos and exceptions, as to which there can be no pretence that the statute either gave any new, or enlarged any old jurisdiction.\nThere is a large class of cases expressly excepted from the jurisdiction of the commissioners by the 43 Eliz., by declaring \u201cthat this act, or anything in it, shall not extend to any city, town corporate,\u201d or land in them, given to the uses specified, or to \u201ccolleges, hospitals or free-schools,\u201d who have special governors or visitors to govern them, to \u201ccolleges in the universities of Westminster, Eton or Winchester.\u201d 7 Day, Com. Dig. 616, note 19.\nThe 39 Eliz. embraced all \u201ccolleges, hospitals, sehqols of learning and other places founded or ordained for charitable purposes,\u201d but it was repealed by the 43 Eliz. c. 9; 4 Co. Inst. 167; 7 Day, Com. Dig. 614. Yet notwithstanding the repeal of this law, and the proviso in the 43 Eliz. c. 4, chancery has since, as they had done before, exercised a jurisdiction over them, which continues to this day, without any statutory authority, resting on its ancient basis. 2 Fonbl. Eq. 208. Though the 2 Hen. V. placed hospitals under the supervision of the ordinary, yet where the \u201cking or any of his progenitors were, founders,\u201d the ordinary was not allowed to visit them; \u201cbut the chancellor of England is appointed by law to be their visitor.\u201d Co.. Litt. 96a. The king may have a prohibition to the ordinary that \u201che shall not visit them, because the chancellor ought to do it and no other,\u201d \u201cso shall a private founder, if the ordinary will visit or cite any of the poor to appear before him or remove them.\u201d Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 42, 93; Beg. Brev. 40; 1 Lil. Reg. 379. The remedy, must of course, be in the temporal courts. If a resort is had 10 those of equity powers, it must be by ordinary process of a bill at the suit of a subject against subject, or by information in ease the king is party, according to its ancient usages and rules, that wherever property is holden by one in trust and confidence, chancery has jurisdiction to correct fraud, accident and breach of trust. This power is exercised over the governors and visitors of colleges, hospitals and corporations, whenever they are trustees. 3 Atk. 108, 164; 2 P. Wms. 325. Though the jurisdiction of the ordinary is expressly saved by the statute, chancery exercises the same powers over executors and adminis trators who hold money for charitable uses, as other trustees. It is the existence of a trust which is executory that gives jurisdiction to chancery, and not the existence of a charity recognized by a statute; a statute has a different office to perform, to remove disabilities or incapacities, imposed by statute or common law, so as to bring charities back to their original capacity, and place them within the cognizance of the appropriate courts, as if they had never been affected by any change introduced by statutes, which had embarrassed donations for uses of charity, piety and education. When that office is performed, and the ease becomes disencumbered of statutory restraints, the powers of the courts are brought to act on them, as the highly favored objects of the law. Chancery especially will protect them to the extent of its judicial power as a court of equity; and, by the personal jurisdiction of the chancellor, (which he exercises in right of the crown by prerogative, under the sign manual of the king, as parens patriae,) do what the king in equity and conscience ought to do. This is done in cases of charities for purposes so undefined, as not to come within the statute, or general charities, with which the commissioners. have nothing to do, but must be determined by the king in chancery, on an information by the attorney general. In a leading case on this subject, the decree of the commissioners was reversed as to a general charity, but affirmed where the objects were defined with reasonable certainty (2 Lev. 167), so as to come within the statute. In these three classes of cases not embraced in the statute, therefore, viz. \u2014 1, where the objects are wholly vague; 2, cases excepted; 3, cases within the jurisdiction of the ordinary, as all eases provided for by the 17 Edw. II., or 1 Edw. VI., the jurisdiction of chancery is wholly independent of its provisions, and is exercised as if it had never passed; as is strikingly exemplified in the cases of hospitals placed under the power of the commissioners by the 39th, but excluded by the 43 Eliz. There was no ground on which chancery could take their supervision as to the execution of trusts, but by its extraordinary or personal jurisdiction existing before the 43 Eliz. It has been supposed that the latter must have been derived from the statutes, from .the circumstance of there being no reported cases of its exercise ante-cedently: if there is any weight in this supposition, it applies with the same force for sixty years afterwards, for there is no reported proceeding in chancery on charities where the king is a party till after the restoration of Charles II.; but this circumstance is satisfactorily accounted for, by referring to former statutes.\nAll the land of the abbeys, monasteries, &c., which were suppressed by the statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI. were placed in the hands of the commissioners appointed by the king, under the order and governance of the court of augmentation of the king\u2019s revenue, which had also the exclusive cognizance of all claims for charities, charged on, or accruing from the suppressed lands, by which the king could be in any way prejudiced or affected. Keb. St. 608; 4 Co. Inst. 121; Gilb. Ex\u2019ns, 159; 2 Ruffh. St. 226. On the abolition of this court, its powers devolved on the exchequer, without any act of parliament (Dyer, 216a, pl. 55; Skin. 612; 1 Bac. Abr. 597) which had the control of the king\u2019s lands and revenues (4 Co. Inst. 194) before the erection of the court of augmentation in 27 Hen. VIII. c. 27; 4 Co. Inst. 121, 122. The king\u2019s demesne and purchased lands, with those which accrued by forfeiture and escheat, together with all matters affecting them, were under the supervision of the exchequer, which was a court of original jurisdiction, both in law and equity, by ancient statute and usage, in all cases affecting these lands, or any claims upon them, or his revenues or profits issuing therefrom, in which the proceedings were by bill, information, monstrans de droit, petition of right, or the transverse of inquisitions, as the case may be. 3 Bl. Comm. 44; 2 Co. Inst. 23, 553; 4 Co. Inst. 108; 1 Bac. Abr. 597; Hob. 63; Hardr. 50; 2 Lev. 34; Dyer, 303; 3 Day, Com. Dig. 312.\nThe court of wards and liveries was erected by the 32 Hen. VIII. c. 46; it was a court of record and equity, in which the proceeding on the part of the king was by information in the name of the attorney general, and on the part of a subject, by the usual mode of proceeding appropriate to the jurisdiction of the court, which extends.to all wardships of the king by statute, tenure or prerogative, in any lands or their issues and profits, as well as the estates of idiots and natural fools, and charities charged on the lands of his wards or tenants, which were in his wardship. 4 Co. Inst. 188, 202; Bohun, Ch.. Cas. 468; Hob. 136. The jurisdiction of the exchequer was taken away from all cases cognizable by the court of wards and liveries (4 Co. Inst. 189), and the statute 33 Hen. VIII. c. 39, declared the jurisdiction of all these courts to be exclusive over the subject matter within their respective cognizance. Keb. St. 555; 2 Ruffh. St. 324. The courts of augmentation, and surveyors of the king's revenues \u2014 of exchequer, and wards, and liveries, had all the powers of a court of equity, in the exercise of whicli they proceeded by information, petition, traverse of inquisition, or English bill, and decreed for or against the king, according to the equity and conscience of the case as between subject and subject. 7 Coke. 19b; Hardr. 27, 176. 230, 502; 4 Co. Inst. 19; Hob. 136. A reference to matters placed under the supervision of these courts will show conclusively that during their existence the chancellor could in no capacity act upon charities in any case to which the king was a party in interest, or where he came into conrt by the attorney general; if a charity was charged upon his lands, or those he held in ward, its orders and governance belonged to some of these courts exclusively, and, as parens patriae, all lands so given to charities as to require his interposition by sign manual, came directly\u2019 within his wardship \u2014 as in the case of infants, idiots and lunatics. 2 P. Wms. 103-118. Hence all jurisdiction over charities which were too vague and general to vest according to the ordinary rules- of equity \u2014 all charities charged upon lands which would have escheated to the king or mesne lords but for the provisions of tlie statute of Templars \u2014 all charities charged on the suppressed lands for- superstitious uses, which would have been seized by the king under the statutes of chauntries, but for the direction of the statute 1 Edw. VI. \u2014 and all charities charged on lands belonging to the king\u2019s wards, was devolved on the court of wards and liveries.\nThe powers of this court were derived from the 32 & 33 Hen. YHI. and not from the 43 Eliz., which makes no mention of it. Xet we find from Flood\u2019s Case. Hob. 130, the authority of which is admitted, that that court decreed the establishment of a charity out of lands in wardship of the king, Flood being his tenant. The decree was made by the ordinary power of the court, and in a case not only not within the 43 Eliz., but expressly exempted by it, as one of the colleges of Oxford. The only effect of this statute was to remove the disability on corporations imposed by the statute of wills. While the power of this court continued, that of chancery over the subject was necessarily suspended, as the king could not proceed in it by his sign manual appointing charities, or the chancellor as his substitute; but as these charities were originally cognizable by the chancellor, and his jurisdiction ceased by being transferred to another court, and not for any want of a competent power to effectuate all its objects, it would revert to it on its abolition, as was the case of the exchequer on the abolition of the court of augmentations. The court of wards was abolished with tenures in chivalry, first by Cromwell's parliament and afterwards by 12 Car. II. (Keb. St. 1147; 3 Ruffh. St. 192), but the statute contained no provision for devolving its powers on other courts. That portion of its jurisdiction which grew out of feudal tenures was of course extinct, that which was founded on the prerogative of the king in the supervision of charities, the care of lunatics, infants and idiots having been before the erection of the court of wards within the cognizance of the chancellor, returned to him as an original jurisdiction which had been merely suspended. Fonbl. Eq. 207; 2 Tern. 342; 3 Bl. Comm. 427, 428; 2 Atk. 553; 3 Atk. 635; Mitf. Pl. 29.\nWhen the chancellor resumed this branch of his jurisdiction the proceedings were conducted as they had originally been, and as followed by the court of wards, according to the usual course of equity in all courts, by modes of proceeding appropriate to the case, and according to the principles which had been settled by long and uniform usage in the exercise of its powers; by an authority neither conferred nor enlarged by the 43 Eliz. nor assumed from the necessity of the case on the subject of charities, more than any others to which their unquestioned jurisdiction extended. The personal or prerogative jurisdiction of the chancellor has been and continues to be the subject of great diversity of opinion in England and this country; but the radical difference between the two governments precludes the necessity of examining the question in this case. Here the executive of the state or Union has no prerogative powers or authority; his sign manual can confer none on a court of chancery; the chancellor is not the keeper of his conscience, or the attorney general his representative in courts of law or equity; the rights and prerogative of the crown devolved on the several states by their declaration of independence, and the assumption of the powers of self-government. The sreneral supervision of infants, idiots, lunatics and charities, which thus devolved on them, can be exercised only by the authority of the legislature. A state cannot be made a party to a suit, without its consent expressed by a law or resolution, and no judicial proceeding or process by or against the attorney general, unless by the authority of the state, can prejudice its rights. He can have no control over the fund which may belong to the state by escheat, on the extinction of all the objects for which it was created, and a failure of the heirs of the donor, or which comes to the prerogative wardship of the state over persons under legal disabilities; neither can be disposed of without an act of the legislature, who are the keepers of their own conscience, as fully in relation to their prerogative rights over the property of others, as the original public domain of the state.\nIt suffices for the purposes of this case, to have ascertained that the original inherent powers of chancery proceeding as a court of equity, according to equity and good conscience, can be exercised by this court to the full extent of the emergency of this case, independently of the 43 Eliz., either by its enactments, or any new rules or principles of the law of equity supposed to have been developed in its exposition. Having given our views of the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts, in the case of Baker v. Biddle [supra], we deem it unnecessary to review them, as we are fully satisfied of the correctness of the opinion there delivered. Its application to this case will be found to cover all the questions of jurisdiction which can arise.\nHaving disposed of the objections to the capacity of the meetings of Friends in this and other states, to take by deed or will for charitable purposes, the next subject o\u00ed inquiry is as to the particular uses specified in the will \u2014 in the contested items which are, \u2014No. 9. The eight acre lot is devised to the yearly - meeting as a fund, the income of which is to be paid as an annual subscription into their stock \u2014the application of which has been to the printing and dissemination of books and writings that have been approved of by the society. 10. The bequest of the one thousand dollars to the five monthly meetings of Woman Friends, is for the relief of the poor members thereof. These meetings having a common stock and treasurer, and it is applied to the support of the poor, and teaching poor girls trades. 11. This is a bequest of \u00a330, and interest from the year 1759, for the use of certain Indians. This sum appears to have been received by the father of the testatrix, from one Captain Newcastle, an Indian, for the use of his cousins, but a small part of it only was paid \u2014the will directs this sum to be put into faithful hands, and was devised to the treasurer of the yearly meeting, for the relief and benefit of said Indians, for whose use it had been received by her father, and was evidently intended as the payment of a debt which she assumed by her will. 12. This was a legacy to the treasurer of the yearly meeting in Philadelphia, appointed to relieve the Indians, to the benefit of said Indians. The objects of the meeting are the civilization and improvement of the Indians of the Seneca and Tuseora tribes in New York, to supply them with articles of husbandry, oxen, and iron for mills. 17. Is a like bequest to the treasurer of the Baltimore yearly meeting, for the relief, benefit, and civilization of the Indians under their care, who live in the state of Ohio. No money appears to have been expended for this object for some years past, but the committee are ready to carry them into effect, if they can be found. 18. This is to Friends composing the Baltimore yearly meeting, towards their \u201cstock,\" if they have one, if not, to one when it is their pleasure to establish it. It appears that this meeting had a stock at the death of the testatrix, which was applied to the printing of books of a religious character, or on business of the society, the expenses of members attending the legislature, and the keeping of Friends horses during the meeting. 19. This is a legacy to the yearly meeting at Mount Pleasant, in Ohio, for their stock, as in the preceding clause; there is no doubt they have a stock for the same purposes as other yearly meetings. 20 & 21. Are legacies to Quaker meetings in Virginia for the relief of the poor thereof \u2014 towards the enlarging their meeting house, and the erection of a stone wall to enclose the lot on which it is built \u2014both meetings having a stock and treasurer, and all yearly meetings have a stock. 22. Is a legacy to the citizens of Winchester, in Virginia, (which is an incorporated town,) for a fire engine and hose.\nIt would be a waste of time to examine into the validity of these uses. As objects of charity, benevolence or liberality, by the common or statute laws of England or Pennsylvania, they are good and valid by both. [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 45; 17 Serg. & R. 93. Even the statute 9 Geo. II., does not apply to bequests of money or personalty, and the testator has specified purposes, charitable in their nature. 2 Rop. Leg. 105, 106; 9 Ves. 406. There appears no adjudication as to a bequest for a fire engine or hose, but there needs no argument to prove it as much an object of public utility, as a session house (Poph. 139), a town house (7 Johns. Ch. 294), or of charity, as cleansing streets (23 Hen. VIII. c. 10), the repairing bridges, &c. (1 Edw. VI.; 43 Eliz.) or in case of taxes and assessments for the preservation of the property of the citizens. We should administer the law of charity in this state, with little regard to its principles, in excluding from its protection so laudable an object as this.\nAs to the bequests for the benefit of the Indians, there can be no doubt of their being proper objects of charitable donations, as coming within what Swinburne defines, \u201cpoor miserable persons,\u201d calling for the aid of the charitable and benevolent. Swinb. 66. They have been so recognised by the legislature of the state in the Laws of 1788, incorporating a society for their relief and improvement. as a pious and charitable purpose (Laws 1788, p. 40). In this particular, both judges fully concur. Though there is a difference of opinion on some matters connected with this bequest, which were much dwelt on in the argument on both sides, there is none as to their being proper objects of charity, and that the uses and purposes to which the donations of the Quaker meetings are applied, are not only lawful, but in the highest degree deserving encouragement and protection. We have thus come to the conclusion that the devise of the eight acre lot, and all' the bequests in the will of Sarah Zane, which have been contested, are for pious and charitable uses and purposes, sanctioned by law.\nThe next inquiry is, are they so limited or appointed as to take effect for the objects intended. It must be observed, that except the 22d, \u2014 the devises are all in trust for the objects of the charities; the only interest which any of the Quaker societies have in the bequests, is in aid of their contributions for their stock, which appears to be made up by assessments on the different subordinate meetings, but they take in no other way for any individual or collective use or benefit. The organization of these meetings is very regular, though none of them are incorporated. Their gradation is. \u2014 preparative, monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings \u2014 the latter having the control of all the subordinate ones, but all composed of the same members, and each meeting has its stock and treasurer, its application being directed, by the respective meeting, .to agreed, approved and definite objects. The testatrix was a member of the Philadelphia yearly meeting, and appears to have been connected, in a friendly manner with the meetings in Baltimore, Frederick county, in Virginia, where she died; and with the meeting of Mount Pleasant, a branch from the meeting of Maryland. We must therefore presume her to be familiar with the organization and discipline of all the meetings, in all their details, as is evident from the provisions of the will. When she devotes part of her property to the stock of a particular meeting, it is most certainly her intention that it shall be applied according to its discipline and usage, as well known and understood by herself. It follows that a contribution to such stock is of the same legal effect as if the objects of its application had been specified in the will, as in the case of a devise to an hospital, or any known institution; it is for the uses and purposes intended by the founder; so a devise by way of contribution-to a fund devoted to specific objects, by a society who make it up, is in law a devise to such purposes and such only, it can be directed to no other by the trustees, or a court, though the object may not be clearly defined. 1 Vern. 43, 55; 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 99; 1 Atk. 356; 3 Mer. 400.\nIt will be ascertained by usage, by the situation and circumstances of the testator, to discover what he meant when the will gave no explanation (2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 366. &c; 3 P. Wms. 145), as if he was a refugee, and devises generally to the poor, it shall be intended poor refugees of the same nation as himself (Ami). 422; Duke, Char. Uses, by Bridgman, 494; 2 Rop. Leg. 147; S. P., Swinb. 316, 480); or \u201cto the charity school,\u201d and there were two in the place, evidence was received to show that the testator was fond of the children in one of the schools, and declared he would leave them something at his death. 1 P. Wms. 674. 675; S. P. [Powell v. Biddle] 2 Dall. [2 U. S.] 70-72; 2 P. Wms. 141. That a devise to the poor of any particular parish or church is good, has been often decided (2 Rop. Leg. 147, 148; Toth. 30). In this case they are more definite, being to the poor of particular meetings, which, by reference, makes the designation complete, when we advert to the master\u2019s report, finding, that, at the death of the testatrix, and before, there were meetings of the kind referred to at each place designated by her in the will. Finch, 184, 245; 2 Lev. 167, 168; 1 P. Wms. 425.\nThe devises for the benefit of the Indians are likewise made specific by the evidence reported by the master, specifying the tribes of Indians, and the particular relief afforded by the committee during thirty years, by the expenditure of large sums of money, from time to time, under the direction of the meeting. The intention to apply the bequests in the same manner is too apparent for any court to entertain a doubt. If any could exist, or should hereafter arise, before a final decree, it is within our unquestioned powers to direct further evidence to ascertain and carry it into execution, if no other objections exist than the want of certainty in the will itself. In [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 1, the devise was to \u201cThe Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia, annually,\u201d which \u201cI allow to be a perpetual fund for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination, who shall appear promising for the ministry, always giving a preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s family.\u201d The court declared the association to be described with sufficient accuracy (page 26,) and that such a legacy would be sustained in England, (page 29;) so that there was no doubt of the validity of the devise, had the trustees been capable of taking for the objects intended. In Witman v. Lex, the devise was \u201cTo St. Michael and Zion churches, to be laid out in bread for the poor of the Lutheran congregation, of which the testator was a member, and towards the education of young students of that congregation, under the direction of the vestrymen of the first named churches,\u201d and held good.' 17 Serg. & R. 90-93. So of land appropriated by deed for public uses for the benefit of the inhabitants of a town, as a majority may order and direct. 6 Serg. & R. 211. So of a lot marked in the plan of a town \u201cfor the Lutheran church,\u201d for religious purposes. [Beatty v. Kurtz] 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 578. This was held good without further description of either the donees or uses, and to take effect when the church should be erected. The court took into consideration the use to which the lot had been appropriated from the time of the donation, which was for a meeting house and burying-grbund, and though the .house had fallen down from decay, and no new one had been erected, they decreed it to be enjoyed according to the former use.\nA legacy to the town of New Rochelle, to erect a town-house to transact public business in, has been held a sufficient description of the charity. 7 Johns. Ch. 294; S. P., 1 Ch. Cas. 134. Courts of chancerv act under an obligation to effectuate charitable donations by all the means in their power (2 Freem. 261, 330; 3 Mer. 391), more liberally than in private cases, without regarding the form or prayer of the bill. 1 Atk. 356; 1 Brown, Ch. 12; 2 Ves. Sr. 426; 1 Ves. Sr. 418; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 198; 11 Ves. 365; 1 Ves. Sr. 468-475. It is enough that the testator expresses his general intention to establish a charity by making a donation to any object deemed charitable in law, or by using the word \u201ccharity.\u201d 2 Ves. Sr. 399; 10 Ves. 535; 17 Serg. & R. 93; [Baptist Association v. White] 4 Wheat. 45. Wherever a trust is created for charitable purposes, the mode by which it is to be effected, or the specific objects of its application, are not material to its validity. 2 Rop.

So of money in the hands of a trustee, the profits accumulate for the benefit of the fund. 3 Atk. 238.\nChancery will establish the charity on the application of any person who has any interest in the fund in his olvn right, or as an inhabitant, or a parish officer (1 Ch. Cas. 134), a member of a society having a common benefit from the donation, or a committee of a voluntary association without charter, though they could sustain no action at law, \u2014 [Beatty v.

The courts of this country have gone pari passu with those of England, in aiding defective descriptions or designations of the places, objects or purposes of a charity, wherever they could, by the terms of the instrument, connected with extrinsic circumstances, give locality and application to the fund according to the intent of the donor as near as may be. [Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor] 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 117. Words will be construed in their most liberal and expanded meaning, in order to make out the substance of a charity capable of being aided on equitable principles, or the existence of a trust in the heir at law, dev-isee or executor, in the execution of which any individual or society has an interest which can be enjoyed by them, or held for their use, consistently with the terms of the donation by an equitable right; chancery will draw to it the legal interest, and give it full effect by a plan to be drawn up under the direction of the court by a master, or the trustee,\nAn inscription on a tombstone has been held sufficient (Duke, Char. Uses, by Bridgman, 349-366,) or any direction by any writing, which can be deemed to be a limitation, disposition, assignment or an appointment, or gift of property to a charitable use \u2014 it will be enforced against parties and privies, except purchasers for valuable consideration of money or land, without notice of the trust\u2014 not regarding the form of the instrument. Moore, 888; Comyns, 250; Finch, Pree. 471; Sugd. Pow. 222, 223. A direction by a nun-cupative will, was held to be an appointment or limitation before the statute of wills.

St. 51, 52,) though he dies before the testator, (2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 293; 1 Brown, Ch. 15; Amb. 571; 3 Brown, Ch. 528,) refuses to act or abuses his trust, (2 Ch. Cas. 131; 7 Day, Com. Dig. 772,) chancery will remove him and appoint another, (Ch. Rep. 7S, 79; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 194,) or compel him to assign it. Finch, 269. These are the principles of equity which the supreme court, in 17 Serg. & R. 91, 92, declare to be the common law of the state, which have been uniformly applied as far as the powers of the courts could be extended to the exercise of chancery jurisdiction. Since the acts of ISIS, 1S2D and 1828, the3* can be applied to all trusts as fully as they can be in England, by the common law of equity or the provisions or construction of any statute. They cover all the ground of equity which it is necessary to assume for the decision of this case; the defendant is a trustee for the purposes of the will; the bequests are to trustees either named or designated, who are capable of holding and distributing the funds intrusted to their management, the cestuis que trust are either sufficiently described or easily ascertained by intrinsic circumstances, and the uses for which the dispositions are made are not only valid, but favored and protected by the law, which can effectuate without the exercise of any personal or prerogative jurisdiction.\nWe shall direct the administrator de bonis non, cum testamento annexo, to pay the respective bequests to the persons appointed to receive and distribute them. They will be considered as trustees, acting under the supervision of this court, as a court of chancery, with the same powers over trusts, as courts of equity in England, and the courts of this state, possess and exercise. Though our orig inal cognizance of the case depends on the residence of the parties to the suit, yet when the fund is under our control, we can proceed in its final distribution among the different claimants in the same manner as if each was a party competent to become an original complainant, by original bill. Baker v. Biddle [Case No. 764]. When the fund shall be so ascertained as to be capable of a final distribution, it will be directed to be applied exclusively to the objects designated in the will, as they existed at the time of her death, and shall continue till a final decree; if any shall then appear to have become extinct, the portion bequeathed to such object must fall into the residuary fund as a lapsed legacy. Its appointment to other purposes, or cestuis que trust, than those which can, by equitable construction, be brought within the intention of the will or donor, is an exercise of that branch of the jurisdiction of the chancellor of England, which has been conferred on this court by no law, and cannot be exercised, virtute officii, under our forms of government. As the amount of the personal estate is evidently far short of the legacies made payable by the will, there must be a failure or abatement, unless the necessary amount can be raised out of the real estate not specifically devised. The testator having authorized the executor to sell the house in Chestnut street, and the Marlborough estate in Virginia, his powers devolve on the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., by the acts of assembly of this state, (3 Smith, Laws, 433, 434; 6 Smith, Laws, 102;) and as he is a party before us, we can compel their execution, if the laws of Virginia recognise them as competent. But he has no power over any other portions of the real-estate, nor are the heirs at law, or residuary devisees, parties to the suit; so that no decree which we could make would bind them, or the land situated in another state. Our jurisdiction being both limited and local, we cannot compel parties who reside out of the state to appear on our process, and a sale of land in Virginia, under the authority of the court alone, would pass no title to the purchaser.\nIt is an acknowledged principle that the title and disposition of real property is exclusively subject to the laws of the country where it is situated, which can alone prescribe the mode by which a title can pass from one person to another, \u2014 [U. S. v. Crosby] 7 Cranch [11 U. S.] 116; [Clark v. Graham] 6 Wheat. [19 U. S.] 579; [Kerr v. Moon] 9 Wheat. [22 U. S.] 571; [M\u2019Cormick v. Sullivant] 10 Wheat. [23 U. S.] 202, \u2014 to which may be added the case of Hunter v. Bryant, 2 Wheat. [15 U. S.] 32, to which we have been referred, as authorizing the sale of the Virginia lands, now asked to be directed. That was a suit originating in this court, affecting land in Kentucky; but as only five-sixths of the land were represented by the parties to the suit, the court confined their decree of sale to the interest of the five parties before them; the sixth party, in interest resided in Virginia, as to whom the supreme court declared, \u201cThat the complainant must pursue his remedy, unless her representatives shall have the prudence voluntarily to join in lue sales of any land that may be made under this decree.\u201d [Baptist Association v. Hart] 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 34, 44, 45. We are therefore following all these decisions of the supreme court, in refusing to make any further order of sale of real estate, other than the two parts thereof embraced in the power given by the will.\nThe decisions of the supreme court of the state, and of the high court of errors, which bear on the residuary devise in this will, may derange some of the specific devises. If the legacies are a charge on the real estate specifically devised, they might affect not only the devise of the eight acre lot, given to the yearly meeting, but other devises to persons not parties to the suit, who must be heard before we can make any decree, touching such parts of the real estate. Tht application of the rule laid down in Tucker v. Hassenclever, 3 Yeates, 294-299; 2 Bin. 525-531; Nichols v. Postlethwaite, 2 Dall. [2 U. S.] 131; Witman v. Norton, 6 Bin. 396; and Com. v. Shelby, 13 Serg. & R. 348,\u2014 would absorb much of the real estate to pay the legacies; but if they should be considered as a charge only on the residuary fund, according to Shaw v. M\u2019Cameron, 11 Serg. & R. 252, they will not affect the devised lands. On this point we have formed no opinion.\nIt remains only to apply the foregoing view of the law of Pennsylvania to the dispositions of the will in question.\n1. To the devise of the eight acre lot to the yearly meeting. We know historically that this has been a religious society from the settlement of the province. We know, from the acts of the legislature, that they have held real estate, and yet hold it. under deeds from the proprietor, from individuals, and by the laws of the state, guarantied by all its constitutions, have a perfect right and capacity to take, hold and enjoy property without incorporation, or tenure in mortmain.\n2. The bequest to the monthly meetings of Women Friends, is for a charitable use, which is good and lawful, and they are capable of taking and distributing the charity, according to the will of the donor, in the most liberal and ample sort.\n3. The bequest of the thirty pounds received by the father of the testatrix from Captain Newcastle, and the interest we consider to be intended as the payment of a debt which she considered herself to be morally and equitably bound to pay, and therefore direct it to be paid by the executor, as a debt of the estate, to such Indians as are the relations of the said Newcastle, if to be found; if not to be found, to remain subject to the future order of the court.\n4. As to the devises to the Indians, our opinion is, that they are good and valid. That the treasurer of the societies or meetings, or their committees for the time being, are capable of taking and distributing the fund as a trustee under their direction, and that Indians are proper objects of charitable bequests. But they are to be applied to the relief of such Indians as have heretofore been under the care and supervision of the yearly meetings, or their committees respectively. and to be distributed only for such objects and purposes a's were customary in the lifetime of the testatrix, such being her manifest intention.\n5. As to all the devises to or for the benefit of the different meetings of Friends in Baltimore, Virginia and Ohio, we are clearly of opinion that they are good and valid in law, and decree accordingly.\n6. As to the bequest to the citizens of Winchester, to purchase a fire engine, we consider it good as a charitable use, or one tending to public profit and the safety* of property, and in ease of taxes and burdens on the citizens. This is the substance and intent of the bequest, and, being given for a good and meritorious object, it is not material by what name it is given; whether to the corporation, or the citizens who compose it, it must take effect, notwithstanding any misnomer or other defects of name, form or circumstance.\n7. The bond of Isaac Zane appearing to us to have been assumed by the testatrix as honestly due by one of her near relations, ought to be considered in equity as a debt due, and be paid by the executor out of her estate, as such was evidently her intention, and from the evidence reported by the master we think the party now before the court entitled to receive it, and decree accordingly.\n8. We order and decree that the administrator de bonis non make sale of the house and lot in Chestnut street at such time and place as the court may hereafter direct, or private sale, at his discretion.\n9. Also to make sale of the Marlborough estate in Virginia, in the same manner, if such sale is authorized by the law of Virginia. If such sale is not authorized, then we order and direct the administrator to make application for such authority to the legislature or such judicial tribunal as by the law of that state is competent to authorize such sale, according to the will of the testatrix, or the order of this court.\nWe have been asked to go farther, and decree a sale of all the undevised estate of the testatrix, as necessary to provide a fund to meet the various legacies and bequests; the counsel who made the application considering that the residuary clause in the will was to be so construed that nothing should pass under it till all the former dispositions were satisfied. As the residuary devisees are not before the court, and would not be bound by its decree, we have not considered, and shall express no opinion on that subject \u2014 having no power to affect real property in another state, but through the parties in interest, or those having power over it, we must confine our order for the sale of the estate to such parts of it as are in the hands, or within the control of the administrator under the authority of the will. We have full power to see that the will be faithfully and religiously observed and executed, but none to order a sale not directed to be made by any of its provisions.\n1\nThe following summary list of uses declared by statute and adjudged cases to be valid, as pious and charitable, for which property could be held prior to the 43 Eliz. will fully sustain this position: (1) Gifts for the exercise and celebration of divine service, to find a chaplain, a taper to burn before an image, prayers for souls, the defence of the church, obits, or service of a priest.

The statute of 43 Eliz., as a statute, has never been adopted in this state; but its conservative provisions have been in forte here, by common usage and constitutional provision. Not only so. but the more extensive range of charitable uses which chancery sustained before the statute of Elizabeth, and even beyond it. The statute of 9 Geo. II. never was in force in Pennsylvania, and consequently the law of charitable uses here stands unaffected by it. The courts of enuity in this state will not hesitate in supplying any formal defect in the execution of a power by will in favor of a charity. Pepper's Will. 1 Pars. Eq. Cas. 436.\n3\nThough the ob jects of a charity are uncertain, a devise will not fail for waut of a trustee capable of taking, if a discretionary power of selecting is vested anywhere. And such power may be vested in an unincorporated religious association. Thus a devise of real and personal estate to the monthly meeting of Friends, at Philadelphia, for the northern district, (being an unincorporated religious association) to be applied as a fund for the distribution of good hooks among poor people in the back part of Pennsylvania, or to the support of an institution or free school, in or near Philadelphia, was established in a court of equity, against the heirs and representatives of the testator, on a bill by certain members of the meeting, on behalf of themselves and other members. Pickering v. Shotwell. 10 Barr [10 Pa. St.] 23. And see Beaver v. Filson, S Barr [8 Pa. St.] 327; Wright v. Linn, 9 Barr [9 Pa. St.] 433.\n4\nA voluntary association of individuals, who have contributed funds for a public purpose, will be regarded as a charity, and a court of equity in this state has jurisdiction over the parties. Funds supplied by the gift of the crown, or from the legislature, or from private gift, for legal, general or public purposes, are charitable funds, to be administered by a court of equity. Therefore, where money is given by will, gift, or voluntary contribution of individuals, to a voluntary, unincorporated hose company, or fire association, formed for general and public usefulness, without individual emolument or advantage, it is a charity over which a court of equity will exercise control. Thomas v. Ellmaker, 1 Pars. Eq. Cas. 98."},{"case_name":"Eliab Going versus John Emery","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2022295\/","date":"1834-10-01","court":"Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court","content":"Shaw C. J.\ndelivered the opinion of the Court. Tne present claim arises in a real action brought against one of the heirs at law of Samuel Stone, to recover an undivided fifth part of the real estate of which Stone died seised, and the defence proceeds upon the assumption, that this estate descended as intestate property, unaffected by any devise oi power contained in the will. The only question directly presented for consideration, is upon the title to the legal estate ;,but it is contended, that the validity of the deed by the executor to the present demandant depends upon the existence and sufficiency of the power contained in the will, that that power, if it exists, is merely auxiliary and subservient to the intent and purpose of the testator, in giving the proceeds to Messrs. Todd and others, in trust, to be applied for religious and charitable purposes, and therefore if this gift is void and the intent of the testator in this respect cannot be carried into effect, because contrary to the rules of law, then the power to the executor is void, and nothing passed by the executor\u2019s deed, and so the legal estate still remains vested in the tenant and the other heirs at law. In examining this proposition, we have two principal questions for consideration. 1. Whether the executor had a power to sell real estate ; and if so, 2. Whether the gift of the proceeds to Messrs. Todd and others was valid.\n1. This will is certainly very inartificially drawn, but this circumstance is never held to affect the validity of a will, where the meaning of any particular clause, expounded by a consideration of all other parts of the will, can be ascertained with reasonable certainty. The rule then applies, that if a -estator having a right to dispose of his real estate, directs mat to be done by his executor, which necessarily implies that the estate is first to be sold, a power is given by this implication to the executor to make such sale and execute the requisite deeds of conveyance.\nIn the present instance the testator manifests a clear intent to appropriate the whole residue of his estate to the religious and charitable purposes indicated. The clause in his will is, \u201c I give and bequeath all the residue of my estate, both real and personal, of whatever name or nature soever, or wherever said property may be found, to the cause of Christ, for the benefit and promotion of true evangelical piety and religion.\u201d The whole clause is not perhaps .in good taste, or expressed with any strict accuracy of language ; the words \u201c give and bequeath \u201d in this sentence are not legatory, for want of a donee ; but they do express an intent to dispose of the whole estate, real and personal, and declare the property dedicated and set apart for the promotion of religious charity. The next clause shows the mode by which he intended that this object should be accomplished. \u201c And I do order and direct my executor to collect all the last above specified property as -soon as can be done, consistently, without sacrificing too much by forcing the sale thereof in an improper manner, not however to exceed the term of five years, and pay over the same,\u201d &c.\nHere the terms, the \u201c last above specified property \u201d clearly designate the residue of his real and personal property There is no devise over; and a clear intent is expressed not to die intestate. He speaks of a sale, and inserts a caution against a forced or premature sale, and yet secures the execution of his intention, by fixing a term beyond which it shall not be postponed ; he manifests an unequivocal intention that the whole shall go to the legatees named, and yet it can do so only through the medium of a sale by the executor ; the term \u201c collect \u201d and the term \u201c pay over,\u201d are not applicable to real estate, but supposing a sale made, they are strictly applicable to the proceeds of such sale. From all these considerations it appears to us very clear, that it was the intent and understanding of the testator, in the terms used, that his executor should sell and dispose of the real estate of which he should die seised, and that the further directions apply to the proceeds. Now as the testator had an unquestionable right to confer this power on his executor; as in expounding a will the fixed rule is, not to require the testator to make dispositions or confer authorities, in any form of words, but to gather bis intentions from the words used and all the terms of the will, whatever they are, the Court are of opinion, that by force of this will a power was given to the executor to make sale of the real estate, it being necessary to carry into effect the other purposes of the will. And whenever an executor has a power under a will to sell real estate, no license of any court is necessary to, or can give any additional validity to any sale and conveyance which he may make. And it is considered a good reason for refusing such license, that the power already exists.\n2. The other, and probably by far the most important question is, whether this gift can be supported, it being con tended, in behalf of the heir at law, that the gift is void for uncertainty, both as to the persons who are to take the legal interest, and those who are ultimately to receive the benefit of it. That clause in the will is as follows, (after the clause before cited,) \u201cand pay over the same unto the Rev. John Todd, of Groton, Rev. James C. How, Peppered, Rev. Phillips Payson, Leominster, and Rev. Rufus A. Putnam, Fitchburg, placing full confidence in their piety, judgment, and integrity, immediately to be by them sacredly appropriated to the cause of religion as above stated, to be distributed in such divisions and to such societies and religious charitable purposes as they may think fit and proper.\u201d\nThis objection was strongly urged in the case of Bartlet v. King, 12 Mass. R. 537, to which the present bears a strong resemblance, but it was not there sustained. It has been contended in the argument, that this case differs from that in several particulars, and one is, that in that case the gift took effect immediately in the legatees, whereas here it vests in the first instance in the heir at law, and never does vest in the legatees. But we think this is a difference in the circumstances of the case not affecting the principle. In all oases where a testator adopts this mode of disposing of his property, by empowering his executor to sell the property and directing him to. pay over the proceeds to a particular person, the estate before sale vests in the heir at law. But upon the sale, the estate of the heir is divested, and it becomes vested in the purchaser, and the proceeds of the sale stand upon the same footing as a legacy out of personal property.\nIn considering the force of this objection, that of uncertainty as to the legatees, and as to those who are to take-beneficially, it will tend to a better understanding of it, if we consider the parts of the proposition separately.\nIn the first place it is obvious, that the persons who are to take the legal interest in this legacy, are designated with precision and certainty. It is given to Messrs. Todd, How, Payson, and Putnam, jointly and personally, in their natural capacities. There is no doubt or uncertainty as to tne legal property and the capacity of the legatees at law to take and hold the property. This entirely distinguishes the case from that of the Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat. 1, where the main difficulty was, that those who were to take the legal interest, in the first instance, were uncertain ; and this defect in the 'devise of the legal interest could not be helped by the St. 43 Eliz. c. 4, relative to charitable gifts and donations, because that statute had been in terms repealed in Virginia, where the question arose. Still though the persons who are to take the legal interest are certain, if the objects are wholly uncertain, it would either be a void gift, or, what is the same thing in effect, in regard to the beneficial interest, they would take it in trust for those who are legally entitled to it by the statute of distributions. It is quite manifest, from the whole tenor of the will, and the particular terms qualifying the gift, that it was given to Messrs. Todd and others, not foi their own use, but in trust for others.\nIt is admitted in the argument, and indeed it cannot now be contested, that if the statute 43 Eliz. c. 4, in regard to charitable uses, is in force in this Commonwealth, it is sufficient to sustain and give effect to this trust, because there are innumerable cases, in which trusts quite as vague as the present, have been declared valid, and carried into effect. I will refei to only one striking case, where a testator gave \u00a31000 to such charitable purposes as he had by another writing directed. The paper referred to was not found, so that it stood generally as a gift to charitable uses. The trust was established, and the direction to a particular object left with the king as parens patrios. Att. Gen. v. Syderfen, 1 Vern. 224.\nThere is no case in the reports of this Commonwealth, directly in point, deciding that the statute in question has been adopted in this Commonwealth. What English statutes are deemed to be in force here, is often a question of difficulty, depending upon the nature of the subject, the difference between the character of our institutions, and our general course of policy, and those of the parent country, and upon fitness and usage. As a general rule, it must be considered that our ancestors came here as British subjects, submitting to the obligations and claiming the protection and privileges of the laws of England, as they then stood. All the statutes of the realm, previously made, especially those altering, modifying, or declaring the common law, were included with and adopted as a part of that code. Those statutes of a general and beneficial nature, such as the statute of uses, of wills, and the like, of which many were passed in the reigns of Henry 8, Elizabeth, and James 1, were as useful in their nature and as beneficial to the subject, as the body of the common law. By an act passed soon after the granting of the provincial charter, 4 Wm. & Mary, Anc. Chart. 213, 229, it was pro vided, that all the laws and ordinances in force under the then late colonial government, should remain in force until altered or repealed by the provincial legislature thereby established. And by the constitution of the Commonwealth, c. 6, \u00a7 6, it is declared, that all the laws which have heretofore been adopted, used and approved in the Province, Colony, or State of Massachusetts Bay, and usually practised on in the courts of law, shall still remain and be in full force until altered or repealed by the legislature. It is by this course of regular transmission, that the common law of England, and the statutes in force at the time of the settlement of this country, have been established and have the force of law at the present time. It is difficult to perceive why the statute 43 Eliz. c. 4, passed some years before the granting of the first charter, and before the emigration of our ancestors, should not be deemed one of those thus adopted. Many of its provisions were well adapted to the condition and circumstances, as well as to the policy and religious views, of the early emigrants. Though there is no decision upon this point, it does not stand altogether without authority. Some general rules pointing out what early English statutes are in force here, may be found in a case in the first volume of our Reports. Commonwealth v. Leach, 1 Mass. R. 59. Sedgwick J. says, \u201c It appears to me, generally speaking, that the English statutes, which were in force at the time of the emigration of our ancestors, are common law here.\u201d Dana C. J. adds, \u201c Generally when an English statute has been made in amendment of the common law of England, it is here to be considered as part of our common law.\u201d\nIn 4 Dane\u2019s Abr. 6, speaking of the statute 43 Eliz. c. 4, he says, this statute makes the true distinction, between gifts to superstitious, and those to charitable uses, and states that this statute, in principle, was adopted by our ancestors here.\nIt is manifest, that it could only have been adopted in prin~ ciple, and not in form, because, by the provisions of that statute, its objects were to be carried into effect by the agency of the court of chancery, either in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction, or by the modes specially given by that act; but as no court of chancery was established here, the principles only of the statute could be adopted and applied by the ordinary tribunals, as guides for their decision, in their own course of proceeding. The same course appears to have been pursued in other States, adopting the laws of England as the basis of their jurisprudence.\nIn Pennsylvania, where there is no court of chancery, it has been held, that though the Stat. 43 Eliz. is not adopted in form, its principles have been adopted and acted upon and have the force of law there, so as to sustain vague bequests, if the object be charitable. Witman v. Lex, 17 Serg. & R. 88.\nIn Maryland it is considered, that the statute 43 Eliz. is tac.'tly reoealed, inasmuch as it is not included in a list of English statutes in force, reported by Chancellor Kelty, and sanctioned by the legislature, by being put forth under their authority. Dashiell v. Att. General, 5 Har. & Johns. 392.\nIn Virginia, as\" we have already stated, the statute was in terms repealed after the revolution. Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat. 1. The tacit or express repeal of this act, implies that but for such repeal it would be in force.\nBut a statute in many respects similar to the 43 Eliz. was early passed, according to the simple forms of our colonial legislation, providing that all gifts and legacies to the college, schools of learning or other public use, shall be truly and faithfully disposed of according to the true and declared intent of the donors. And all persons betrusted &c. shall be liable to give account of their disposal and management thereof to the county court &c., who are empowered to require the same, where need shall be, and to appoint feoffees of trust to settle and manage the same according to the will of the donors. Anc. Chart. 52. This ordinance not only declares that the gift shall take effect according to the intent, but where there is a defect in the form of the gift, so that the legal estate cannot vest, the county court shall have power to make good such defect by appointing feoffees, to take and hold the legal estate. This is in addition to the authority of calling the trustees to account, and gives in terms to the county court, what it has been contended the court of chancery acquired by implication only from the statute of 43 Eliz., the power of remedying defective conveyances and assurances where the general object is a charitable one, within the intent of the statute.\nAn argument was drawn from the provincial act 28 Geo. 2, (Anc. Chart. 605,) being an action for the better securing ana rendering more effectual grants to pious and charitable uses, and it was asked where was the necessity of passing such an act, if 43 Eliz. was in force. We think in looking at that act, and the corresponding revised act, St. 1785, c. 51, that the gifts were made by well disposed persons, and were deemed good, but the doubt was, how such estates were to vest and go in succession according to the intent of the donors ; and by force of the statute, deacons of churches, and the warden and vestry of Protestant Episcopal churches, were made gtiasi corporations, capable of taking and holding all the gifts therein described in succession, so as the better to perpetuate and carry into effect the intent of the well disposed donors. The purpose therefore was to remove doubts respecting the legal estate, and to declare and confirm the same to these quasi corporations. It rather implies that such gifts were good in principle and in substance, but might be defeated by the ignorance or unskilfulness of grantors, in not creating proper trustees, in whom the legal estate might vest, in order to support and carry into effect the charitable intent.\nBut we think the case of Bartlet v. King, which has been cited with approbation by the Supreme Court of the United States upon this point, (Inglis v. The Trustees of the Sailor's Snug Harbor, 3 Peters\u2019s R. 99,) is itself a very strong author ity to show, that the 43 Eliz. c. 4, has been substantially adopted in this Commonwealth. It is true that that statute v not expressly referred to, either in the argument or the decis ion. But it is quite manifest, that it was tacitly refer'-,d to and its principles were made the basis of the decision. The objection was there, as here, that the object of the fequest was vague and indefinite. But to obviate that objectmn, the Court say that the object of the bequest, and the persons fot whose benefit it was intended, are not more indefinite, than they are in a great number of cases to be found in the books, in which the trusts have been adjudged to be good : \u2014 a bequest in trust for the advancement of the Christian religion among the infidels in North America, Att. Gen. v. The City of London, 3 Bro. C. C. 171 : \u2014 a trust for the benefit of poor clergymen, Moggridge v. Thackwell, ibid. 517 ; to a lying-in hospital, White v. White, 1 Bro. C. C. 12 ;\u2014to the poor inhabitants of St. Leonard, Att. Gen. v. Clarke, Ambler, 422 ; \u2014 to poor dissenting ministers living in any county, Waller v. Childs, ibid. 524. And they further say, that in the case of Christ's College, Cambridge, 1 W. Bl. 91, it is adopted as a principle on which the case was determined, that the court of chancery will aid a defective conveyance to legal charitable uses. By a reference to these cases, it will appear, that they were decided upon the principles of the statute 43 Eliz., and by adopting them as the basis of an important decision here, the case affords a clear implication that either the statute itself, or the substance and the principles of the statute have been adopted and now have the force of law in this Commonwealth.\nTaking this statute in principle and substance to be in force, we think this trust to a charitable use, though to a great degree vague and indefinite, may be supported. The property is well given to the legatees, the trust is plain and manifest, confidence is reposed in their piety, judgment,'and integrity, to appropriate this property immediately to promote the cause of religion, by distributing it in such divisions, and to such societies and religious charitable purposes, as they may think fit.\nIn all the cases of charitable uses, or nearly all, the persons ultimately to be benefited by the donation are uncertain. The heathen of foreign lands, in the case of Bartlet v. King, were the ultimate objects of the donor\u2019s bounty ; but of what foreign country, when, how, and to what amount, with all the particular details, were left uncertain, in all other respects than this, that the testator reposed confidence in the trustees, a confidence earned by their known character for fidelity and judgment, that they would appropriate the money in such manner as to accomplish his intentions. This was held sufficient to obviate the objection of vagueness and uncertainty.\nWe are of opinion that the present case falls within the same principle ; the donees are particularly designated, the trust is clear, the general objects sufficiently indicated to bind the consciences of the trustees, and to render them liable m equity to account for the execution of this trust, by a sui): to be instituted in the name of the attorney-general, representing the public ; and that these objects are sufficiently certain and definite, to be carried into effect, according to the established principles of law and equity, governing donations to char-table uses.\nTenant defaulted."},{"case_name":"Nailor\u2019s Children against Nailor and Wife and Others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2059299\/","date":"1836-10-06","court":"Kentucky Court of Appeals","content":"Judge Ewing\ndelivered the Opinion of the Court.\nEdward Nailor and others, representing themselves as - the only children of George Nailor by a former wife, filed their bill against said George and his present wife, and others to. whom lie had, within a short time past, sold slaves\u2014alleging that their father was nearly eighty-seven years of age; that, he was weak and childish and\u201e: had been so for several years; that such was and had been his. imbecility of mind,, for somg length of time?,. that he was wholly incapable of managing his; affair? with ordinary prudence and discretion, and that he Vas as easily imposed on and controlled, by those who have an influence over him, as a child of ten years of age.\nInjunction.\nDemurrer, and bill dismissed.\nThe persons and arfdlunatics,!\u00b0ih ^ntStant\u00ed aicbSUb cenor\u00b0\u2019s power.\"1 Th^fpim of pro-t^fontotheclian bellor, which the ny friend of the idiot or lunatic may prefer; and upon which a' writ de \u2022 'idiota fyc. issues,' returnable in chancery, where the inquisition may be traversed.\nA similar proceeding is proper here; but if a bill be filed, containing the allegations suitable for a petition, and a prayer for general relief, the court may proceed upon it\u2014treating the Unnecessary allegations as surplusage.

Seep. 343\nThough the proceedings in this case are not technically formal, when tested by the English practice; yet the bill contains, substantially, all the allegations which would be proper in a petition, and is verified by affidavit, as required by the common law. And though there are many specific prayers w'hich are unwarranted by the forms of practice, and cannot be granted, there is a general prayer,, which will authorize the Chancellor to afford that redress which is consistent with the rules of law, and the powers of the Court, according to the circumstances of the case.\nBut it is contended that though the English Chancellor had jurisdiction of such cases, that his powers were personal, and not judicial, granted by the special warrant of the crown, as a prerogative power, which conferred no equitable jurisdiction, but only a power of administration; and therefore, without a special statute investing the power, it has not passed to our Court? of Equity in this country.\nThis view is certainly very plausible, and is not without some authorities which go apparently to sustain it.\nBut, thpugh the powers \u2019 exercised by the English Chancellor, were conferred upon hint by the special warrant of the King, he exercised them as a judicial officer; and much of the business done by him, was judicial in its nature, and wa.s a,s well for the benefit o( the subject, as of the crown.\nAnd so far as the. po wers exercised by him, were for the benefit, security and safety of that unfortunate class of individuals, as subjects of England, they are equally necessary for the protection, security and safety of the same class of individuals as citizens of the colonies, and as citizens of this Commonwealth; and the laws in force there are applicable here as to the rights of individuals; and remedy should be afforded by some tribunal. And., although those'pow\u2019ers were exercised by the Chancellor there, as a prerogative power of the King, and as his min istcria] agent, acting under his special grant, the powers have been assumed and exercised by our Courts of Equity, and their assumption of the power sanctioned by legislative enactment, and it is now too late to question the jurisdiction of the Court over the subject.\nThe act of \u2019S3, concerning per-' so,\\is of unsound mind,\" requires attorneys of' thq C'om\u2019th- to instU tute proceedings in such cases; but the act, in that' respect, is' merely directory, an'd to savet.heunfortunate from sufferingby neglect, and leaves nnim-' paired the right which creditors, friends and relations oY such persons fed, before the statute, to po tition for an en- . 'quiry and proper proceedings in such cases.\nThe statute, approved December 19th, 1793, entitled \u201can act for the restraint, support and safe-keeping of persons of unsound minds\u201d (Stat. Law, 793,) as well as subsequent statutes on the same subject, are unequivocal recognitions of jurisdiction in our Courts of Chancery, over the subject.\nBy the above statute, it is enacted\u2014\u201cthat, if any per- \u201c son be of unsound mind, it shall be the duty of the at- \u201c torney general or of the attorney for the State or the \u201c county as the case may be, upon being informed there- \u201c of, to make application to any Court of Chancery within this Commonwealth, to appoint a committee to such unsound person; and the Court of Chancery to whom if application shall be made, shall (in the manner heretofore \u201cprescribed) make enquiry into the fact, and make such \u201c order respecting the support, restraint and safe-keep- \u201c ing of any such person who shall be so found to be of \u201cunsound mind, as to them shall seem just and proper. \u201c Whenever the estate of such unsound person, shall be sufficient for the support of his family (if any he \u201c have) and of himself, the said person shall be supported \u201c out of such estate, &c.\u201d\nWe understand this statute, as recognizing the jurisdiction of our Courts of Chancery over the persons and and property of persons of unsound minds, as heretofore exercised, and as pointing to the laws theretofore in force, as their rule in the manner and mode of proceeding. And, though the statute imposes a duty upon certain attorneys of the Commonwealth, to put in motion the proceedings, this is but directory to them, and a mean used by the Legislature to insure attention to the condition of that unfortunate class, when they might otherwise be neglcct.ed by their relations or friends, or have none, who would feel sufficient interest in their behalf, to take the necessary steps for the provident application of their property to their comfort and support, when they had any, or to provide for them when they had none;\nThe jurisdiction of courts of equity over the persons and property of persons of unsound mind is not restricted to cases of idiocy \u00f3r lunacy, strictly speaking; it extends also, td the case of every person who, in consequence of old age, disease, or any' other cause is in such a state of mental imbecility as td be incapable of conducting his affairs with common prudence, a\u00fad leaves him liable to become the victim ofhi\u00e1 own folly, or the fraud of others. \u2014But\u2014\nThe jurisdictiotl should be assumed and exercised with great caution, and only where a clear case of non compos mentis appears by inquisition.\nBut the statute contains no repealing clause; is remedial and cumulative, and cannot be fairly construed (as contended by the counsel for the appellees,) as repealing any provision of the common law which recognizes the right of other persons, such as friends or relations or even others, filing the petition.\nBut it is contended that the bill or petition contains ho specific charge of idiocy or lunacy, nor ahy allegations that are equivalent, and that tho Court should not grant an inquisition or commission of lunacy in any case of imbecility which falls short of lunacy.\nIt is true that, the majority of anti-revolutionary adjudications have given this construction to the common law; but the whole current of authorities since, with a sounder and more rational view of the subject, as we believe, have settled it otherwise.\nWe cannot perceive the reason or propriety of a rule, that would provide for the safety and protection of the property of an individual, who is subject to occasional alienations of mind, such as will denominate him a lunatic, and would fail to provide for the safey and protection of the property of a person, who, from disease, old age, or grief,.is reduced to that state of mental imbecih ity which disqualifies him for the ordinary prudential management of his affairs. In the one case, as well as in the other, lie is exposed to the arts of designing persons, and liable to be rifled of his substance, without fault on his part, and reduced to poverty and wretchedness.\nWhen the mind of an individual is worn out by years, s'\u00f3 as to be incompetent to act with any proper or provident care or management, he is as much entitled to the protection of the law, as the tender infant. He is indeed in his second state of infancy, and is as much the subject of folly or of fraud as an infant.\nIt would be strange indeed, if the common law, which is said to bo the perfection of reason, while it affords protection and guardianship to the helpless in all other conditions, should leave wholly unprotected, a class of cases, equally exposed to danger.\nIt is peculiarly the province of a 'Court of Chancery to protect those who are incompetent to protect themselves, as well as to afford redress to those who have from weakness or imbecility of mind, been made the victims of fraud. And, indeed, it would seem much better, where it could be done upon any plausible authority; for the Chancellor to interpose his powers to prevent the evil, than to borrect it afterwards!\nIt is true, the powers claimed should be exercised with great caution and delicacy, as tending to an encroachment upon the liberty of the citizeti.\nA clear case should bS made out, upon the inquisition, df non 'conipos mentis, or mental incapacity to manage his own concerns. And when such a case is made out; with the guards which the law has thrown around the unfortunate individual, of aright to have the inquisition \"found by his peers; who will ever lean towards the liberty of the citizen; and, also, the right to traverse the inquisition before the Chancellor, if found against him; there can be no danger in its exercise, but protection and security td the helpless!\nChancellor Kent; after reviewing the decisions of th\u00e9 English Courts, concludes his opinion thus:\u2014\n\u201c I am satisfied that these latter decisions are hot only 45 founded in good sense, arid the necessity of the case; 44 but are a sound exposition of the common law, which 45 gave to the King, as parens patriae, the care and custody 44 of all persons who had lost their intellects and become 44 non compos or incompetent to take care of themselveS; 44 (Beverly's Case, 4 Coke, 127-8, 1 Bl. Com. 304,) all the 44 cases agree that the statute of 17 Edw. II, committing 44 to the King the care of the persons and estates of idiots 44 and lunatics, was not iritroductory of a new right, but 44 only went to regulate a right pre-existing in the crown. 441 should feel that I had but very imperfectly discharged 44 my trust, if I was the means of crippling the jurisdiction 44 of this Court by confining it to the strict common law 44 writ of lunacy. A numerous class of persons whose 44 minds have sunk under the power of disease, or the \u201c weight of age, would in that case be left without protec- \u201c tion, and liable to beeom\u00e9 the Victims of folly or fraud. \u201cThis would be a blemish in the jurisprudence of the \u201c country.

Which would seem to indicate that, the Legislature did hot intend to confine the enquiry to cases of idiocy or lunacy only, according to the strict sense of the terms; but to other cas\u2019es equally exposed to danger, and equally entitled to the protection and guardianship of the Commonwealth: such as unsoundness of mind that disqualified the individual for the protection of himself and sub\"h lance.\nIf the allegations of tire petition be true, {and upon the demurrer they must be taken as true,) the case be'fore the Court, is precisely such an one as falls within the expositions given of the common law in cases of u\u00f1\u00e9soundness of mtnxl from old age which renders the individual incompetent to manage his own affairs\u2014not amount5ing to lunacy, and which needs the guardian protection of the law; and such an one, as may without any strained construction be embraced within the broad expressions used by some of our statutes'.\nWe therefore think it was proper to grant a writ in the nature of a writ of -lunacy.\nBut, as this proceeding is by petition, and not by bill, and for a specified object only (the appointment of a eommitt\u00e9e) it would seem, in the general, proper only to bring the person charged with unsoundness of mind before the Court. And this is the course generally of the English practice. And no object could be attained by bringing others before the Court, unless it was to enable them to traverse the inquisition, which it would be proper to allow without making them parties, if their interest as vendees might be effected by the inquisition, being made to extend back to a time beyond the time of their purchase (Ex parte Hall, 7 Ves. 261) unless a case was made out in the petition which would authorize the Court to grant an injunction, or restraining order, to prevent them from removing or selling the property purchased.' Such a case is not made out in this petition.

Chester Lee, David Streeter & Eli Lee","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/613550\/","date":"1838-02-01","court":"Vermont Supreme Court","content":"The opinion of the court was delivered by\nWilliams, C. J.\nBy the declaration and pleadings, it appears that the plaintiff is an infant and an idiot, residing in the town of Vernon, placed under the guardianship of Mr. Clark who resides in the town of Brattleboro, that she was assessed by the defendants, as listers of the town of Vernon, for money on hand, or money and debts due, in consequence of which, there has been collected from her, for taxes, the sum of twenty four dollars, by imprisonment of her person. The question is, whether a person like her, is liable to be thus assessed. The general terms of the act declaring that the polls, estate and property of the inhabitants of this state, shall be set in the list and be liable to the payment of rates or taxes, are sufficiently comprehensive, to embrace the case of the plaintiff. It is highly reasonable that she, who in her helpless state enjoys the protection of the government, for her person and property, should, if of sufficient ability, contribute towards the expense of maintaining the government. Still, if the legislature have not provided for such cases, or if the law which they have enacted, cannot be extended to a case like the present, without manifestly violating plain and obvious principles, it is not for the court to supply the omission. If the system providing for the assessment and collection of taxes, is not applicable to a person situated like the plaintiff, it belongs not to the court to make a different system, for the purpose of meeting the contingency, however just, proper or equitable it might be. If by the generality of the terms of the statute, the plaintiff may be considered as within the letter, yet, if she is absolutely and utterly unable to comply with its requirements, and cannot have the same remedy and redress, if she is injured, which other citizens have, the \u201c violence of the letter,\u201d must be mitigated by a reasonable construction, and it must be considered that the legislature designedly omitted to subject her by the general terms made use of. It was said by Plowden, that when \u201c Acts of Parliament enjoin the doing of any thing which \u201c requires sound and perfect reason in the execution of it, \u201c the makers of the act do not intend it to be done by \u201c those who have not perfect reason, for if so, their law \u201c would be utterly against reason, for to insist that an infant \u201c or man of unsound mind, who have no reason, but live in \u201c ignorance invincible, shall use reason, or else lose their in- \u201c heritance, would be very unreasonable, which is never to \u201c be presumed of the legislature.\u201d The plaintiff is an idiot, presumed in law, not to have any understanding or glimmering of reason, and never likely to obtain any. If she is liable to be assessed and taxed, she may be imprisoned for nonpayment, she must submit to such assessments as may be made, and cannot avail herself of any of the provisions of the statute, in case of an improper or unjust assessment. The payment of the tax, must be enforced against her, personally, as there is no other mode of collecting taxes, except by levy on the property, or body, of the person set in the list.\nOn examining the act, in relation to the principles on which the list of the state is to be made, we find, that if any person on the first day of April, shall have money on hand, or money due, &c. Although an idiot may have money due, yet, he cannot have any on hand, as it is all directly placed in the custody, and under the control of the guardian. If this difficulty might possibly be obviated by a construction of the statute, yet, there are others which appear insure mountable. The person, having such money on hand or due, is required to exhibit, and deliver to the listers the amount thereof, on or before the - first day of May. This an idiot cannot do. The listers are required to notify all persons to exhibit and deliver to them true lists, &c., either by set-? ting up a notification, or in case such notification is not set up, by a personal demand. An idiot is incapable of receiving such notice. The listers are required to lodge with the town clerk, on or before th.c twentieth day of June, a list of all the assessments made by them, for the perusal and inspection of the persons assessed. An idiot can neither understandingly peruse nor. inspect such'list. If any person' shall think himself over assessed fpr money on hand, he may apply to the selectmen, and make a disclosure on path, what sum is due to him, which disclosure, made in writing, shall be taken and deemed the true sum in which such person shall be assessed. This important provision of the statute, is wholly a dead letter as to idiots. They knpw not the nature pr obligation of an oath, and cannot disclose, either in writing or otherwise. All these act.s and duties are personal, and cannot be performed, either by attorney or guardian. If it should be said, that the guardian may give in the list, and receive the notices before mentioned, it will be answered, that the law does not require or contemplate it, nor could he take the oath, before referred to. It results frpm this view, that although the plaintiff may be embraced by the letter of the statute, requiring all persons to exhibit their, lists, &c., yet, it must be held that she was not intended, as she is void of reason and understanding. Several instances might be mentioned, where the terms made use of in a statute are equally general and comprehensive, and yet cannot be. considered as intending to embrace persons in the situation of the plaintiff. Any person, upon whom a subpoena is served, must appear and testify, or be subject to a penalty; yet this cannot intend an idiot, incapable of receiving a subpoena. Several cases of a similar kind, are enumerated by Plowden, 264.\nThe statute in question, being inapplicable to the plaintiff, in all its provisions, both in the assessment and collection of the tax, it follows that she was wrongfully assessed, and must recover in this action. It is not a question before us, whether the assessment could be made against the guardian, or whether it is casus omissus. In the case of Payson v. Tufts and others, 13 Mass. 493, it was holden that the property of minors was liable to be assessed in the public taxes, and that it was to be set to the guardian personally. This, however, appears to have been determined, from the words of the tax act, where it was contemplated that property might be assessed to a guardian. It would be obviously more reasonable to assess the property to the guardian rather than the infant or idiot, but whether our statute is not equally defective in this particular, it is not for us to say. It is sufficient, that we are satisfied that the ward is not personally liable.\nThe judgment of the court is, that the plea in bar is insufficient."},{"case_name":"CASE OF \u201cTHE PHILADELPHIA AND TRENTON RAIL ROAD COMPANY.\u201d","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1836978\/","date":"1840-01-01","court":"Supreme Court of Pennsylvania","content":"The opinion of the court was delivered by\nGibson, C. J.\nA certiorari lies in all judicial proceedings in which a writ of error does not lie; and being a substitute for a writ of error, it is governed by the same, or strictly analogous, principles: consequently no point can be raised on it which is not apparent exclusively in the proceedings removed by it. Though not peculiar to road cases, this principle was enforced in the case of the Schuylkill Falls Road, (2 Binney, 250;) of Penn's Grove and \u25a0 Concord Road, (4 Yeates, 372;) and of Spring Garden street, (4 Rawle, 194:) in all which this court refused to enter into the merits, or to decide facts on depositions. One exception alone has been made to it. In the Case of the Baltimore Turnpike, (5 Binney, 484,) evidence was heard in support of the proceedings on a point which perhaps did not need it; as all presumptions favourable to regularity may be made in consistence with the record. The exceptions in the case before us, have been framed in disregard of the general rule. In the twenty-six points raised by them, I discern few that are legitimate subjects of re-examination; and as we sit here, not to settle abstract principles, but to determine matters which lie in the course of our functions, my first business will be to cast out such of them as are not determinable here.\nIt is obvious that the fourth, fifth and sixth exceptions, and also the ninth, with its eight specifications, belong to the rejected class. The supposed misleading of parties by the advertisement; the alleged misconduct of the jury in refusing to hear the owners of property and their witnesses in support of their objections and claim to damages ; are matters that do not appear by the record: by reason of which, even were there substance in them, we would be compelled to dismiss them. We do not find, however, that the act by which the proceeding was directed, authorised the jury, or any one else, to assess damages; and objections to the route on the ground of policy or convenience, they were to determine, not on the testimony of witnesses, but on their own view, as was decided in Johnson's case, (2 Wharton\u2019s Rep. 277.) The judges of the Quarter Sessions, as they had not viewed, might indeed have satisfied themselves of the propriety of the location by the information of others; but that they were satisfied without it, is not ground of error examinable here. The ninth exception, also, with its specifications, by which is alleged that the reported route agrees not with the directions of the act, depends on facts of which we judicially know nothing; nor would they perhaps avail the exceptants if they were properly before us. We perceive not that the act requires the assent of the districts to the location; nor did it appear on the diagram exhibited at the argument that the road is not laid upon streets between the depots ; and that it is not another rail-road upon another route; or that it is partly on private property. It may, as alleged, be partly on the track laid down under an agreement with the district of the Northern Liberties; but what of that! A part of that track may, notwithstanding, be on \u201c the best route along the streets between the said depots;\u201d and the act requires no more. As to its being laid on the track of the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Rail Road, the interference .might be made a subject of complaint by that company, but certainly by no one else; and the complaint could be heard only by the court below, no other tribunal having power to investigate the fact.\nThe same remarks may be applied to three specifications of the allegation contained in the tenth exception. Of contracts made by the company with the exceptants or the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Rail Road Company, we judicially know nothing; and we cannot test the constitutionality of the statute by an allegation of matters which cannot legitimately appear in the proceedings or in our paper books. From the copies furnished, they appear to be contracts for privileges purchased in other streets; and the law does not disturb them. If they bound the company originally, they bind it still, and the parties may still have an action for any breach of the company\u2019s engagements. None of these matters, however, are subjects of revision by us; and I turn to those which properly belong to us, premising that most of them may be despatched in a few words.\nThe first exception\u2014that the jury of view was not appointed pursuant to an' authorised application by the company\u2014seems not to be founded in fact. They were appointed on the motion of the company\u2019s solicitor; and were it not so, the manner of the appointment is a matter to which the exceptants cannot make objection, since the company\u2019s ratification of the appointment by claiming under it, is equivalent to a precedent authority.\nThe second is, that the road was located by the jury instead of the company. In the act it is said that the company shall locate, and that the court may approve on a jury\u2019s report; but how the inhabitants could be prejudiced by allowing the act of location to be performed by the jury instead of the company\u2019s officers, has not been shown. It is not to be credited that the jury would be less disinterested and regardful of \u201c the public business, trade, and private property\u201d of the inhabitants,' than the company itself would be. It was the privilege of the company to make the location by its officers; and in surrendering it to the jury it renounced a benefit provided for it, which a common -law maxim too trite to be repeated, authorised it to do. Even were that not so, the jury might be considered as its agent, having made the location by its direction, as evidenced by its subsequent ratification of the act. The question before the court, however, regarded not the paternity of the location but the propriety of it. Not only the court, but the jury were to be satisfied of the propriety of the latter; and it is' not probable that the jury would have been as well satisfied with the propriety of any other, as with their own. The exception at best depends on a literal interpretation ,\u25a0 and it is not to be favoured.\nThe third is, that the jury were not sworn by the authority of the ' court, or in the terms prescribed by the law. What terms 1 The act itself prescribed none: nor did it direct the jurors to be sworn at all. And yet it is stated in the report that they were sworn or affirmed according to law; and as nothing in the record contradicts it, we are to take it as it is stated. It was provided that the jury should be appointed \u201c as directed \u201d\u2014and here the sentence was left incomplete by the omission of something intended to have be\u00e9n sub-, j.oined; but what that was, cannot be conjectured. In the case of Adelphi Street, (2 Wharton\u2019s Rep. 176,) a proceeding to vacate a street, was held to be within the purview of a preceding section to vacate a particular alley, which was directed to be in the usual manner; and this on the ground that there were general principles of practice in laying out and vacating streets, to which the legislature must have referred.\" That-practice, however, has no relation to the proceeding before us which is sui generis. That it-was not intended to be regulated by the road law, is clear from the fact that no petition for a view was required; nor was there to be an order to view, because the jury were to act on being applied to, and consequently without a particular mandate. As then no oath was prescribed, it is not necessary that the jurors should have been sworn qt all; and this disposes also of the eighth exception that the court had not allowed, in conformity to the general road law, two full terms betwixt the appointment of the jury -and the confirmation of their report. \u201e\nThe remaining exception is more important, because it calls in N question, for specific reasons, the validity of the statute which is the \u25a0 foundation of the proceeding, and which is said to be unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of contracts; by violating the | chartered rights of the districts of Spring Garden and the Northern I Liberties; by violating the contract under which the right qf pass- f age is assured to the inhabitants of this particular street; by taking the property of the street without compensation to the districts of individual proprietors; and by monopolising the street in derogation of the public and private uses to which it had been applied. This, perhaps, is the substance of all these multifarious specifications.\nWhat is the dominion of the public over such a street! In Eng land, a highway is the property of the king as parens patriae, or universal trustee; in Pennsylvania, it is the property of the people, not\u2019of a particular district, but of the whole state; who, constituting as they do the legitimate sovereign, may dispose of it by their representatives, and at their pleasure. Highways, therefore, being [ universally the property of the state, are subject to its absolute direc- f tion and control. An exclusive right of ferriage across a navigable Stream, which is a public highway, is grantable only by it; and the navigation of the stream may be impeded or broken up by it at its pleasure. In the construction of her system of improvements, Pennsylvania has acted on this principle. Her dams across her principal rivers to feed her canals, have injured if they have not destroyed the , descending navigation by the natural channels; and this without a suspicion of want of constitutional power. The right of passage by ^ land or by water, is a franchise which she holds in trust for all her j citizens, but'over which she holds despotic sway, the remedy for an I abuse of it being a change of rulers and a consequent change of the law. No person, natural or corporate, has an exclusive interest in the trust, unless she has granted it to him. Her right extends even to the soil, being an equivalent for the six per cent, thrown into every public grant as compensation for what may be reclaimed for roads; and she has acted on the basis of it; for though damages for special injuries to improvements have been-allowed by the general road laws, nothing has been given for the use of the ground. This principle was broadly asserted in the Commonwealth v. Fisher, (1 Penns. Rep. 466.)\nSuch being a highway as a subject of legislative authority, in what respect is a street in an incorporated town to be distinguished from it? A municipal corporation is a separate community; and hence a notion that it stands in relation to its streets as the state stands in relation to the highways of its territory. That would make it sovereign within its precincts\u2014a cons\u00e9quence-notto be pretended. The owner of a town plot lays out his streets as he sees fit, or the owner of ground in an incorporated town, dedicates it to ; public use as a street; but it follows not that the dominion of the state t is not instantly attached to it. The general road law extends to every incorporated town from which it is not excluded by provision of the charter; and the statute book is full of special acts for opening, widening, altering, or vacating streets and alleys in Philadelphia and our other cities. Were it not for the universality of the \u2022 public sovereignty, the public lines of communication, by rail-roads and canals, might be cut by the authority of every petty borough through which they pass; a doctrine to which Pennsylvania cannot submit, and which it would be dangerous to urge. It would be strange, therefore, were the streets of an incorporated town, not public highways, subject perhaps to corporate regulation for purposes of grading, curbing, and paving; but subject also to the paramount authority of the legislature in the regulation of their use by carriages, rail-cars, or means of locomotion yet to be invented, and this without distinction between the inhabitants and their fellow-citizens elsewhere. The doctrine was carried to its extent in Rung v. Shoenberger, (2 Watts, 23,) in which it was affirmed that, though a city has a qualified property in its public squares, it holds them as a trustee for the public for whose use the ground was originally left open; and that the enjoyment of them is equally free to all the inhabitants- of the commonwealth, subject to regulations not inconsistent with the grant. In Barter v. The Commonwealth, (3 Penns. Rep. 259,) it was inadvertently-said that the title to the soil of a street'is in the corporation, whose right to improve it for purposes which conduce to the public enjoyment of it, is exclusive and paramount to the right of an inhabitant. The point was only incidentally involved, and consequently not very particularly considered; but the question of title, involving as it has done, no more than the bounds of the grant, has lain between the grantor and the grantee, or those deriving title from them. In no case has title been claimed by the corporation. In the Union Burial Ground Company v. Robinson, (5 Whart. 18,) in which the point was elaborately argued, the contest was betwixt the grantor and a purchaser from the grantee; and though the cause was eventually decided on another ground, the court inclined to think, on the authority of many-decisions, that the title to the street, even had it been opened, would have remained in the grantor; and such' appeal's to be the principle of Kirkham v. Sharp, (1 Whart. Rep. 323.) The legal title to the ground, therefore, remains in him who owned it before the street was laid out; but even that is an immaterial consideration; for an adverse right of soil could not impair the public right of way over it, or prevent the legislature from modifying, abridging, or enlarging its use, whether the title were in the corporation or a stranger. I take itj \u00b6 then that the regulation of a street is given to a corporation only for|| corporate purposes, and subject to the paramount authority of the|!' state in respect to its general and moi\u2019e extended uses; and that Sl there would have been no invasion of chartered rights in this instance, even did either of these districts stand in a relation to the public, which would impart to its charter the qualities of a compact.\nWhat then is the interest of an individual inhabitant as a subject of compensation under the constitutional injunction that private property be not taken by a corporation for public usewithout it? Even;, agreeing that his ground extends to the middle of the street, the-public have a right of way over it. Neither the part used for the | street, nor the part occupied by himself, is taken away from him;\u00bb and as it was dedicated to public use without restriction, he is not within the benefit of the constitutional prohibition, which extends not to matters of mere annoyance. The injury of which he can complain, is not direct but .consequential. It consists either in an ob struction of his right of passage, which is personal; or in a depreciation of his property by decreasing the enjoyment of it: but no part of it is taken from him and acquired by the company. The prohibition, even when it precluded a seizure of private property immediately by the state, was not largely interpreted, nor was there reason that it should be, as ample compensation was obtained from her sense of justice without it. The sufferers were overpaid, and this sort of aggression was always courted as a favour. But though she usually compensated consequential damage, it was of favour, not of right. Nor did she always make such compensation. In one well known instance, she destroyed a ferry by cutting off access to the shore, without provision for the sufferer; and in the Commonwealth v. Richter, (1 Penns. Rep. 467,) damages were unavailingly claimed from her for flooding a spring by a dam. The clause in the amended constitution which narrows the former prohibition to a taking of private property for a public use by a corporation, is to \\ receive the same'construction; the word \u2018 taking \u2019 being interpreted to \\ mean, taking the property altogether; not a consequential injury \\ to it which is no taking at all. For compensation of the latter, the \\ citizen must depend on the forecast and justice of the legislature.\nOn the subject of the next specification, it seems scarcely necessary to say that monopolies are not prohibited by the constitution; and that to abolish them, would destroy many of our most useful institutions. Every grant of privileges so far as it goes, is exclusive ; and every exclusive privilege is a monopoly. Not only is every rail-road, turnpike, or canal such, but every bank, college, hospital, asylum, or church, is a monopoly; and the ten thousand beneficial societies incorporated by the executive on the certificates of their legality,by the attorney general and judges of the Supreme Court, are all monopolies. Nor does it seem more necessary to remark, on the subject of the concluding specifications, of exception to the confirmation ofthe report by the associate judges of the sessions alone, that the approval was an act of the court; and that they were competent to hold it.\nProceedings affirmed-"},{"case_name":"Chambers vs Baptist Education Society","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4432607\/","date":"1841-04-27","court":"Kentucky Court of Appeals","content":"Judge Ewing\ndelivered the Opinion of the Court.\nIssachar. Pawling, being desirous to set apart a fund for the education of Baptist ministers, and candidates for the Baptist ministry, application was made'to the Legislature of Kentucky for an act of incorporation, with a view to its reception and permanent and secure investment, for the object intended. At the sessjpn of 1828-9, an act was passed, constituting twenty-four persons therein named, trustees, with corporate powers, by the name and style of \u201cthe Trustees of the Kentucky Baptist Education Society,\u201d and giving to them and their successors, the authority to exercise all the powers, rights, and privileges, which are exercised by the trustees of any academy-of learning in the state, and especially \u201cwith the power and authority, in their corporate capacity, to purchase or receive, by donation, demise or bequest, any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, monies, rents) goods, and chattels, and to hold the same, by the name aforesaid, to them and their successors forever, for the use and benefit of the said institution, and according to the intention of the donor or donors, and no otherwise.\u201d\nIn the following month, Pawling made his will, by which he devised and bequeathed to the trustees, in ther corporate capacity, all his estate, (except some small specific bequests,) amounting to about $20,000, with express instructions, and upon the express terms and conditions, \u2018 \u2018that the whole of the principal should be a perpetual fund, no part of which was to be used, and the interest to he applied exclusively to the education of such Baptist preachers, or candidates for the Baptist ministry, as adhered to the articles of general union of Baptists in Ken- tacky, no part of it to be applied to either teachers or scholars of any other description whatever,\u201d and constituted the trustees his executors, and died some short time thereafter.\nDemurrer to bill aadsus taiued.\nChancery has no jurisdiction to declare the forfeiture of a charter of a corporation \u2014 or inquire into its misfeasances or nonfeasances for that purpose.\nThe trustees, after holding out similar inducements to the citizens of the adjoining counties, at length proposed, that if the citizens of Georgetown and of the county of Scott, would subscribe to the institution $20,000, payable in five years, with interest from the date, and convey to them the College ground and buildings at said town, that they would locate the College at Georgetown. The \u00a1amount was subscribed, and terms proposed complied with, and the College was located as promised.\nU. B, Chambers was one of the subscribers, in a .small amount, and a small sum of the Pawling fund was loaned to him by the trustees. For both of these sums, judgments at few were recovered against him; and h.e filed his bill in chancery, against the trustees and others, injoining their collection, in which he charges various acts \u25a0of misfeasance and abuse of their corporate powers, but mainly in the misapplication of the Pawling fund, to \u25a0other objects and purposes than those designated by Paw-ling, the founder and donor.\nThe trustees demurred to the bill4 which was joined, and the demurrer sustained by the Circuit Court, and the bill dismissed, from which decree an appeal has been taken to this Court.\nAs to the charges, which involve a forfeiture of the charter, a Court of Chancery has no jurisdiction over such matters. It cannot inquire into a usurpation or misuser of powers, by the corporation or any of the trustees, nor into acts of misfeasance or nonfeasance, with a view to the.amotion of any of its members, or the dissolution of the corporation.

And it may be compelled, in good faith, by the order and decree of the Court, to perform its trusts: 1 Vesey, 462-68-70, &c.; 2 John. Chy.

But if there were no such requisition in the charter, by the acceptance of a donation there is an acknowledgement-and acquiescence in the terms prescribed, and an implied obligation to carry out the terms in good faith. As Pawling has prescribed and designated the uses, in unequivocal language, to which the fund donated by him shall he applied, those terms should be carried out, and faithfully executed by the trustees. It is a trust fund, placed in their hands as such, to be vested in good stocks, yielding an interest, or loaned out into good hands, on good security, and the interest applied to the precise objects designated by the donor and founder, and not to any other.\nIt would seem, therefore, to be their duty, as faithful trustees, invested with the funds of the founder, and the discipline and internal government of the College, to provide a suitable teacher or teachers, as far as the funds will justify, with the requisite qualifications to instruct the beneficiaries, in that manner which will best qualify them to perform the high functions of \"preachers of the gospel, in that sect or denomination of Baptists, designated by the donor; likewise to use all reasonable exertions to select and call to the institution, beneficiaries of the class and denomination prescribed, and to fit and qualify them for the high functions contemplated by the founder; literary as well as theological instruction should be afforded them, if the funds will admit, and to accomplish the latter object, it would certainly comport more with the fair intention of the donor, and will contribute more surely to the accomplishment of the object contemplated by him, to employ teachers, if attainable, belonging to the same sect of Christians, with the class of beneficiaries on whom ho conferred his bounty, especially in the theological department. But some discretion is to be allowed to the trustees, in the faithful execution of their trust, as well in the selection of teachers and beneficiaries., (provided the latter be of that class designated,) as in the nature and extent of the instruction to be afforded, having an eye to the amount of the fund bestowed. For though Pawling is the perficient founder, and he and his heirs, as such, were entitled to the visitorial power, in the exercise of which, the institution might have been regulated and controlled at discretion, without responsibility or appeal to any other tribunal; yet he, by the terms of donation, has yielded up the power, and the same is invested, by the charter, in the trustees of the College, rvho, as assignees, and standing in the place of the founder, \u2018 \u2018may exercise all visitorial power, in their sound discretion, without being liable to any supervision or control, so far as respects the government and discipline of the institution, exercising their powers in good faith, and within the prescribed limits of their charter: 4 Wheaton, 674-5; 1 Black.

There is no statute of the state prescribing or regulating such mode of proceeding, if it can be instituted, it must rest for its authority on the common law, and so much of the statute of 43 Elizabeth c. 4, as was declared by this Court to be in force in this state, in the case of 4 Dana, supra, 354, &c.\nIn England, the King is the foundatio incipiens, or incipient founder of all eleemosynary corporations, such as Hospitals or Colleges, &c. as be alone can grant a charter of incorporation, while he who is the first giver of the revenues is the foundatio perficiens or perficient founder: 1 Black. Com. 10 Rep. 33; so here, the Commonwealth is the in'eipient founder, as the Commonwealth, by her Legislature, can alone grant a charter or pass an act of incorporation. And as the King, as parens patriae, had the general superintendence of all charities which he exercised by the keeper of his conscience, the Chancellor: 3 Black. Com. 427; so here, the Commonwealth being substituted for the King, as parens patriae, should exercise the like superintendence and control. And as the powers exercised by the Chancellor there, in the establishment and enforcement of charities, were, for the most part, judicial and not personal to the King, and from whose decree an appeal lay to the house of Lords. 3 Black. Com. 428; and as all the powers, purely judicial, which were exercised by the Chancellor, in England, may be exercised by the Chancellor here, and as we have a ministerial officer of the same title, and exercising, in many respects, the same powers, and performing similar duties with the Attorney General of England, with the exception that he was the ministerial officer of the crown, the Attorney General here, the ministerial officer of the Commonwealth, we can perceive no good reason why the same proceedings may not be instituted here, that were sustain, able there, for the enforcement of trusts, or the judicial contract of such corporations, in their management of trust funds. Public charities are public blessings, and the Commonwealth is interested in giving force and effect to them.

Rep. 230. But a dissolution of the corporation may not be most desirable, nor redound most to the interest of the public.\nIt may be much more consonant to good policy and the advancement of the interests of the Commonwealth, to continue the corporation and enforce the application of the trusts contemplated and provided for by the founder. If an information cannot be prosecuted in Chancery, we know of no other public proceedingwhich can be instituted, on behalf of the Commonwealth, by which that end and object may be attained. And if the founder be dead, without heirs or representatives, and no beneficiary, for the time being, have a vested interest in the use, there would be no person who could institute any 'proceedings against them, to enforce the use, however regardless of their duty, and faithless to their trust they might be.\nWe think, therefore, that a proceeding, in the form of an information, may be prosecuted in Chancery, by or in the name of the Attorney General, against an eleemosynary corporation, to enforce the trust. But while we concede this, we are satisfied that a bill may be filed by the founder, if living, or his heirs, if he be dead, or by any beneficiary, having an interest in the use, or by any other, having a vested interest in the fund, against the corporation, for a true and faithful execution of the trusts confided to it.\nNo individual can proceed against an eleemosynary corporation, unless he be party to the donation, or a representative of one who is, or interested in the same, or in the use to which the fund is donated,\nPawling is the founder, and is a, party to the contract of donation,, and stipulated its terms, and has unquestionably the right to have those terms enforced, and if living, might file his bill for that purpose; being dead, his heirs and representatives, who stand in his place, have also a right to ask of the Chancellor the same measure of justice, and would he indulged in the institution of the like proceedings.\n-But to entitle a private individual to prosecute a bill, he must be a party to the contract of donation, or the representative of such party, or interested in the same, or in the uses to which the fund was directed to be applied. And we cannot perceive that the complainant has any such interest in the Pawling fund, as to entitle him to maintain a bill, upon charges or allegations, with respect to its misapplication. He is not a,party to the donation of the Pawling fund, nor is he the heir of Paw-ling, nor is he a cestui que use, or belong to that class of charitable objects provided for by Pawling. The charge that he is a Baptist, belonging to the general union of Baptists in Kentucky, resident in Georgetown, and owning property there, will not suffice. The interest, thus derived, is too general, undefined, and remote, to justify his interference. It equally applies to a large class of individuals, any one of whom might, with equal propriety, file his separate bill, and greatly embarrass the trustees in the management of a fund donated by another, and for the specified benefit of a defined class of objects, whose character is not pretended to be filled by the complainant. As an injury in reference to the class of individuals, of whom the complainant discribes himself as one, it partakes more of the nature of a public than a private injury, and to be redressed by a public prosecution rather than a civil suit.\nAs to the amount of the Pawling fund, borrowed by the complainant, as he has no right to inquire ipto the misapplication of that fund, he has no more right to withhold its repayment than any other individual to whom any,part of that fund had been loaned. To establish a rule that would allow every individual, to whom any portion of that fund had been loaned, to withhold it until the trustees submitted to an inquiry, and could show that they were applying the funds to the purposes designated by the donor, would be establishing a rule that would subject the trustees to endless litigation, that might result in the entire loss of the interest, in the costs of litigation. He, however, has no right to inquire into these matters or object to repayment on such grounds.\nContractsbysubscription, in aid of a charitable fund, may be avoided as other \u25a0contracts, for false suggestions or suppressions of truth.\nBut expressions of opinions as to the effect on the value of property ata particular point where it is proposed to locate a college, (which is the objectinraising the fund,) is not such representationas will vitiate the subscription, or subject those who express it to the imputation of fraud.\nBut the complainant has an interest in the Scott fund, as it is called, at least to the extent of the sum subscribed by him. He is a party to the contract of subscription, and if he has been seduced into it, by false representations or a suppression of the truth, in matters material to its correct understanding, or if the consideration has failed, he has a right in this, as well as in all other contracts, to ask its dissolution, and a perpetuation of his injunction against the payment of the money subscribed.\nThe charge in the bill, that highly colored and false representations were made as to the effect which the location of the College at Georgetown would have, in increasing the value of property in the town and its vicinity, which had not been realized, is not a representation about a matter, though false, which in law, can be taken advantage of, or subject the party making it to the legal reputation of fraud. A false estimate or representation of value, either present or prospective, will not vitiate a contract. And as the location of the College at Georgetown was the consideration which superinduced the subscription, and as that has been performed by the trustees, there can be no pretext for dissolving the contract on the ground of a failure of consideration.\nAnd it is not pretended, that by the terms of subscription, that the fund subscribed was to be applied to any designated class of beneficiaries, or to teachers of any defined denomination of Christians, or any designation made of the uses to which the fund should be applied. The object of all the subscribers, and the main consideiation moving all, were the location of the College at Georgetown. It is true that the subscription is made to the trustees of a College, and it may perhaps be implied, as within the contemplation of the subscriptions, that it was to be a Baptist College, though it is alleged in this bill, that the trustees gave out as an inducement to subscriptions, that the institution should not be sectarian, and there can be no doubt,, and the contrary is not charged, that many individuals of other denominations, as well as of non-professors, subscribed. To allow each individual to file his separate bill, and to institute an inquiry into his secret motives for subscribing, and to ask the Chancellor to direct the application of his subscription to the objects which was within his secret contemplation, when he made it, would be to subject the institution to endless litigation and embarrassments, and defeat the manifest and specific object of all, namely, the location and rearing up of a College at Georgetown, for literary purposes. Besides, the fact that all of the professors w'ho have been employed in the institution are not of the Baptist denomination, belonging to the general union, or that a portion of the trustees have seceded from that order, cannot deprive it of the appellation or character of a Baptist College.\nUpon the whole, we think, as to the Scott fund, in the absence of all specification as to the uses or objects to which it is to be applied, that each subscriber must be regarded as having subscibed upon the faith of the charter, and the confidence which they had that the trustees, under the responsibilities of their station, would apply the fund in such manner as to promote the best interests of the institution.\nAnd from their failure to designate the uses, in the terms of subscription, which, under the charter, they had a right to do, it may be implied that they intended that the trustees should have the entire control and direction of the fund, provided it was used and applied to the purposes of the College, as they have, by the terms of the charter, the entire superintendence, management, control, and internal government of the College, taking care to use the funds given for a prescribed object to the objects specified by the terms of the gift.\nDecree affirmed.\nRobinson <\u2020 Johnson for defendants.\nWe^donot, therefore, feel it the duty of the Chancellor to raise, by implication, trusts not expressed, and then to exercise his powers in carrying out those implied trusts.\nNor is the allegation, with respect to the ,insecurity of the fund, sufficiently specific and certain, to demand the interference of the court, if even the complainant had the relation to the treasurer\u2019s failure to give the security requred, may be true, and still the fund be sufficiently safe in his hands. And we are not disposed to indulge in presumptions beyond the specific allegations of the bill, which tend to impute negligence or infidelity to gentlemen, the most of whom have been selected and entrusted by the Legislature with the high and responsible functions committed to the trustees by the charter before us. right to inquire into that matter. All the allegations, in\nft j,s> therefore, the opinion of the Court, that the decree of the Circuit Court be affirmed with costs and damages upon the damages below."},{"case_name":"BLAGGE v. MILES","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6127514\/","date":"1841-05-01","court":"United States Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts","content":"STOBY, Circuit Justice.\nThis cause has-been very ably argued upon both sides. It turns principally upon a question, which, rarely occurs in our jurisprudence, the due execution of a power of appointment; and the learning, appropriate to it, has been fully brought before the court in the course of the present discussion. The facts in substance are as follows. (Here the judge recapitulated the facts as before stated, and then proceeded.)\nThe main question, therefore, is, whether, under the circumstances, Mrs. Blagge, by the devise in her will, has duly executed the-power, given her by the will of Mrs. Hall. If she has, then the demandant has no title whatsoever; if she has not, then he is entitled to recover in the suit.\nSome other questions have, however, been raised at the argument, which should be disposed of before we proceed to that, which constitutes the main hinge of the controversy.\nAnd, first it is said, that even if Mrs. Blagge\u2019s will is a due execution of the power, the demandant is- entitled to a share of her estate under the Bevised Statutes of Massachusetts of 1833 (chapter 62, \u00a7 21), as a lineal descendant of Mrs. Blagge, wf\u00edo was unprovided for in her lifetime, and was unintentionally and by mistake or accident omitted to be named as a devisee in her will. The language of the statute is as follows: \u201cWhen any testator shall omit to provide in his will for any of his children, or for the issue of any deceased child, they shall take the same share of his estate, both real and personal, that they would have been entitled to, if he had died intestate, unless they shall have been provided for by the testator in his lifetime, or unless it shall appear, that such omission was intentional, and not occasioned by mistake or accident.\u201d The argument is, that this clause is equally applicable to cases, where the testator has a power of appointment of the estate, to dispose of the inheritance, as well as to cases, where it is his own estate in fee. It does not appear to me, that this argument is maintainable. The language of the section seems to me clearly to point exclusively to a case, where the testator has an inheritance in the estate, and not merely a power of appointment over it. It supposes a case, where the omitted descendant would and could take a title by descent, as of an heritable estate of the testator, and under him, as his heir, in case of his dying intestate. But no person can claim an inheritance, as heir, in case of intestacy, where the ancestor has a power \u2022only, and not an interest. The party, if he can take at all, irust take as an appointee under the power, and not as heir. A power is not a descendible inheritance. The property, which he is to dispose of, is in no just sense vested in the appointor. It is not an Interest, right of, or title to, the property; but a mere authority given to the donee of the power, to be exercised over the property in a maimer, and to an extent, which he does not otherwise possess. And such has been the uniform construction from the earliest period of the law on this subject. See Co. Litt. 342b, Butler\u2019s note 1; 1 Chance, Powers, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 2 Chance, Powers, \u00a7 1632; Co. Litt. 265b. The present power is technically a power in gross; that is to say, the estates, to be raised by it, do not fall within the compass of the estate for life devised to Mrs. Blagge. Co. Litt. 342b, Butler's note 1; Sugd. Powers (6th Ed.) \u00a7 4, pp. 43, 44. A power to dispose of an estate by an appointment among third persons in fee, may be given to a mere stranger; and it would certainly be utterly without the intent of the statute to create an inheritance in the ap-pointor in the execution of the power, which should give his descendants an interest in the estate, upon which the power is to operate. It can make no difference in point of law, that the power, if executed, might be by an appointment among his own children or descendants. This would not change the nature of the power, but only its objects.\nThen, as to another objection, which has been urged, that the resolve is an unconstitutional exercise of power by the legislature, because it is usurping the functions of the judiciary, contrary to the provisions of the bill of rights of the constitution of Massachusetts, which declares, that \u201cthe legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them.\u201d Assuming that such a resolve might be construed, under some circumstances, t\u00f3 be an exercise of judicial power, it would be difficult to apply the doctrine to a case like the present, where it is passed, not in invitum. but at the solicitation of the very person, who, under the power, possessed a complete dominion over the disposal of the entire property. But, after the exercise of this authority by the legislature for more than sixty years, (for such, I am persuaded, has been the practice,) in very numerous cases of a like or an analogous nature, without any objection by the parties in interest, and with the entire acquiescence of the public, it is not, perhaps, too much to say, that it would be still more difficult to treat it as an exercise of judicial power, in the sense of the constitution. The case of Rice v. Parkman, 16 Mass. 326, seems to me directly in point, and establishes, that an authority, granted by the legislature to transmute real property into personal property, for purposes beneficial to the parties interested therein, is not properly the exercise of a judicial power; for it is not a case of controversy between party and party, nor is th\u00e9re any decree or judgment, affecting the title to the property. In short, the court, on that occasion, held it to be, not a judicial act, but a mere ministerial act. The case of Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 627, 660, goes a great way to establish the same doctrine. There, an act of the legislature of Bhode Island, confirming a sale made by a foreign executrix, for the payment of debts of the testator, was held to be, not a judicial act, but an exercise of legislation; a legislative resolution, and not a decree. The case of Ashburton v. Ashburton, 6 Ves. 6. where the lord chancellor, upon the petition of a minor to have some of his money laid out in the purchase of- lands, authorized the purchase to be made, by no means shows, that the act was exclusively judicial. It seems, being upon petition, to have been an act by the lord chancellor, not as a judge, but as the representative of the crown, as parens patriae, having the custody and care of the persons and property of infants. Besides: it is one thing to assert, that a power may be delegated and exercised by a court or judge; and quite another thing to assert, that every power, delegated to. or exercised by a court or judge is judicial, and not ministerial. Many powers, exercised by courts and judges, are in no accurate sense judicial; as, for example, the power to make rules for the due order and arrangement of business. But it is the less necessary to dispose of this question absolutely, and therefore I give no positive opinion upon it; because, if ihe power has been duly executed by Mrs. Blagge, whether the resolve be constitutional or not, makes no difference in this ease, since the demandant has no title whatsoever to the property under her will; and the constitutionality of the resolve is not contested by those, who alone are donees under the power.\nHaving disposed of these points, we may now advance to the main question involved in this controversy. Was the will of Mrs. Blagge a due execution of the power contained in that of Mrs. Hall? And this, after all, I take to depend upon her intention, as expressed in and derived from the language and object of the will of Mrs. Blagge. There was a long struggle in Westminster hall upon the point, whether in wills, the intention of the testator, as gathered ex visceribus testamenti, was to be followed in the interpretation of devises, or whether the technical construction of law, given to certain phrases, was to prevail over the intention. That struggle, at least, since the decision in Perrin v. Blake, 4 Burrows, 2579; Feame, Oont. Rem., by Butler (9th Ed.) p. 156, \u2014 seems to have terminated. It is now admitted to be established, as the general rule, that the intention of the testator is the polestar to direct the court in the interpretation of wills, and that technical words and set phrases are controlled by, and do not control, that intention, when clearly expressed or positively ascertained. The consequence is, that decisions upon particular wills are of far less consequence now, than they formerly were supposed to be; unless, indeed, where the leading provisions are almost identical, and the facts substantially alike. They now furnish, not so much authorities, as analogies, by which to interpret the words of wills in new cases.\nI apprehend, that similar doctrines now generally prevail in regard to the execution of powers, and especially in regard to their execution by last wills and testaments. The main point is, to arrive at the intention and object of the donee of the power in the instrument of execution; and, that being once ascertained, effect is given to it accordingly. Bennett v. Aburrow, 8 Ves. 609. The authorities upon the subject may not all be easily reconcilable with each other. But the principle furnished by them, however occasionally misapplied, is never departed from, that if the donee of the power intends to execute, and the mode be, in other respects, unexceptionable, that intention, however manifested, whether directly or indirectly, positively or by just implication, will make the execution valid and operative. I agree, that the intention to execute the power must be apparent and clear, so that the transaction is not fairly susceptible of any other interpretation. If it be doubtful, under all the circumstances, then that doubt will prevent it from being deemed an execution of the power. All the authorities agree, that it is not necessary, that the intention to execute the power should appear by express terms or recitals in the instrument. It is sufficient, that it shall appear by words, acts, or deeds, demonstrating the intention. This was directly asserted, not only in Sir Edward Clere\u2019s Case, 6 Coke, 18; but it was positively affirmed in Scrope\u2019s Case, 10 Coke, 143b, 144, where the reason of the rule is stated, \u201cQuia non refert, an quis intentionem suam declaret verbis, an rebus ipsis, vel factis.\u201d On the other hand, to use the language of Lord Chief Justice Best, in Doe v. Roake, 2 Bing. 497, 504, \u201cNo terms, however comprehensive, although sufficient to pass every species of property, freehold or copyhold, real or personal, will execute a power, unless they demonstrate, that a testator had the power in his contemplation, and intended by his will to execute it.\u201d\nThree classes of cases have been held to be sufficient demonstrations of an intended execution of a power: (1) Where there has been some reference in the will, or other instrument, to the power; (2) or a reference to the property, which is the subject, on which it is to be executed; (3) or, where the provision in the will or other instrument, executed by the donee of the power, would otherwise be ineffectual, or a mere nullity; in other words, it would have no operation, except as an execution of the power. Langham v. Nenny, 3 Ves. 467; Bennett v. Aburrow, 8 Ves. 609, 616. It seems unnecessary to refer at large to the cases, which establish these propositions. They will be found collected, generally, in Mr. Chance\u2019s Treatise on Powers (volume 2, c. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 1591-1714), and in Sir Edward Sugden\u2019s Treatise on Powers (volume 1, c. 6, \u00a7 2, p. 257 etc.; Id. \u00a7 7, p. 373, etc.; Id. \u00a7 8, p. 430, etc.), and in the opinion of the court, delivered by Lord Chief Justice Best, in Doe v. Roake, 2 Bing. 497. Lord Chief Baron Alexander, in delivering the judgment of the judges, in the house of lords, in Denn v. Roake, 6 Bing. 475. reversing the decision in the same case, in 2 Bing. 497, and affirming that of the king\u2019s bench (5 Barn. & C. 720), has enumerated the same classes of cases; and he has added, that in no instance has a power or authority been considered as executed, unless under such circumstances. Whether this be so, or not, it is not material to inquire; for there is no pretence to say, that, because no other cases have as yet occurred, there can be no others. That would, in fact, be to say, that the cases governed the general rule as to intention, and not the rule the cases. Lord Chief Justice Best has put these classes of cases upon the true ground. They are instances of the strong and unequivocal proof, required to establish the intention to execute the power; but they are not the only cases. Doe v. Roake, 2 Bing. 504. On the contrary, if a case of dear intention should arise, although not falling within the predicament of these dasses, it must be held, that the power is well executed, unless courts of justice are at liberty to overturn principles, instead of interpreting acts and intentions. I entirely agree with Lord Chief Justice Best, in his remark in Roake v. Denn, 4 Bligh (N. S.) 22, that, \u201cBuies with respect to evidence of intention are bad fules, and I trust I shall live to see them no longer binding on the judges.\u201d The lord chancellor, (Lord Lyndhurst,) said, that \u201cIt has been settled by a long series of decisions from the case, which has been referred to in the time of Sir Edward Coke (Sir Edward Clere\u2019s Case, 6 Coke, 18) down to the present time, that if the will, which is insisted on as an execution of the power, does not refer to the power, and if the dispositions of the will can be satisfied without their being considered to be an execution of the power, unless there be some other circumstances to show, that it was the intention of the devisor to execute the appointment by the will, under such circumstances the courts have uniformly held, that the will is not to be considered as an execution of the power.\u201d Certainly it is not. But then this very statement leaves it open to inquire into the intention under all the circumstances; which seems to me to be the true and sensible rule upon the subject; and when that intention is thus once ascertained, it governs. So, it was expressly held, in Pomery v. Partington, 3 Term R. 665; and in Griffith v. Harrison, 4 Term R. 737, 748, 749, the court expressly repudiated the notion, that any technical exposition was to be given to the words of a will, executing a power; and held, that the intention was to be collected from the words according to the ordinary and common acceptation thereof. And again, in Bailey v. Lloyd, 5 Russ. 330, 341, the court held, that the question of the execution of a power by a will, was a mere question of intention, and that intention was to be collected, not from a particular expression, but from the whole will. See 4 Kent, Comm. (4th Ed.) Lecture 62, pp. 333, 334.\nNow, Sir Edward Clere\u2019s Case, 6 Coke, 18, is not only unquestionable law, and has so been always held; but it affords a strong illustration of the true doctrine. In that case, it was held, that the power was well executed, notwithstanding it was not referred to, because otherwise the devise in the will would be inoperative and void. The testator had no estate in the property devised, but only a power over it; and so, ut res magis valeat, quam pereat, it was held, that he intended to execute the power. Nor is there any objection to the doctrine of Lord Chief Justice Hobart, in the Commendam Case, Hob. 159, 160, that if an act will work two ways, the one by an interest, the other by an authority or power, and the act be indifferent, the law will attribute it to the interest, and not to the power. This is but saying, in other words, that where the terms of a devise are perfectly satisfied and inoperative, without any reference to the execution of a power, by working on the interest of the testator in the land, there it shall not be deemed, that he intended to execute the power; but merely to pass his interest. This proceeds upon the plain ground, that there is nothing in the will, which shows any intention to execute the power; and in cases of doubt the court cannot deem it a good execution of the power. Id.\nSir Edward Sugden (1 Sugd. Powers, c. 6, \u00a7 7, pp. 402, 428) has critically examined and commented upon all the leading authorities; and it appears to me, that his criticisms (and he is himself a very high authority upon this subject) are entirely well founded. The courts have, indeed, as he abundantly proves, proceeded in some cases upon very-narrow and technical grounds, and in others have adopted a more liberal and just interpretation; and the \u00bfases do not all well stand together. The rule of ascertaining the intention, however, has been recognized at all times; and, as Lord Kenyon has well observed, in Pomery v. Partington, 3 Term R. 674, 675, if the judges, in construing the particular words of different powers, have appeared to make contradictory decisions at different times, it is not, that they have denied the general rule; but because some of them have erred in the application of the general rule to the particular case before them. In a conflict of authorities, I own, that I should choose to follow those, which appear best founded in the reason and analogies of the law. But, in cases of wills, where the intention is to govern, no authorities ought to. control the interpretation, which the court is called upon to make, unless all the circumstances are the same in both cases, and the ground of interpretation in one is entirely satisfactory to the mind, as applied to the other. If I were compelled to decide between the cases of Wallop v. Portsmouth, 1 Sugd. Powers, p. 394, c. 6, \u00a7 7; Hurst v. Winchelsea, 2 Ld. Keny. 444, by Harmer; Standen v. Standen, 2 Ves. Jr. 589; Lewis v. Lewellyn, 1 Turn. & R. 104; and the case of Jones v. Curry, 1 Swanst. 66, \u2014 if there be any dissonance between them, I should much incline to follow the former. But, in my view, all these cases stand upon their own particular circumstances, and neither is exactly like the present.\nWe must dispose of this case, then, upon principle; for I cannot admit, that it is governed by any positive controlling authority, or that it will trench upon any established doctrine, whichever way it is decided.\nBut before proceeding to discuss the terms of this devise, as an execution of the power, it is indispensable to dispose of an argument greatly pressed at the bar, and that is, that the New London estates, in no proper sense, fall within the scope of the power, which. only applies to the original devised property, and not to these substituted New London estates; first, because the resolve itself does not attach the power to any substituted estates after the sale; and secondly, if it does, still the investment in the New7 London estates, being out of the state, was not authorized by the resolve, and, therefore, cannot be deemed an execution of the power, but is an utterly void act. I cannot accede to this interpretation of the terms of the resolve. The language of it is, that Price, the trustee, is \u2018\u2018to invest the net proceeds of said sale in other real estate, to be held by him upon the like trusts, and for the same uses and purposes as the estate above described is now7 liolden.\u201d It seems to me impossible to entertain any real doubt, that the substituted estate wras to be held upon precisely the same trusts, as the original estate, by the will of Sirs. Hall. The original estate was held expressly in trust for the use of Sirs. Blagge during her natural life, subject to her absolute disposal by her last will and testament, and if she should die without having disposed of the same, then the remainder and reversion to be to her heirs for ever. The language, then, of I the resolve, is not only appropriate to fasten ' upon the substituted estate the like trusts, i uses, and purposes as were attached to the original estate; but I am at a loss to understand, w'hat other words could have been more directly expressive for this purpose. The power was attached to the original estate, and was to be served out of the original trust for the uses and purposes therein stated; and the moment the power was executed, it created a direct trust and use in fayor of the appointees. The case of Wallop v. Portsmouth, 1 Sugd. Powers (6th Ed.) p. 394, c. 6, \u00a7 7, art. 34, seems to be strongly in point.\nThe other part of the argument may have a better foundation in law. It may be true, that the trustee had no right to invest the proceeds of the sale in any real estate out I of the commonw'ealth of Massachusetts; and yet, if that investment has been adopted by the appointees under the power, and the power has been well executed, third persons have no right to interpose and object to it. It amounts, at most, but to a wrongful conversion of trust property, which, however, may, at the election of the cestui que trust, be followed, and the trusts attached thereto in the hands of the persons, holding the property. Nothing is more common in courts of equity, than for the cestui que trust, upon a wrongful conversion of the trust fund to follow it in its new forms, and hold it subject to the original trust. 2 Story, Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 1258-1266. and cases there cited.\nBut it is wholly unimportant, in the present case, whether the investment was rightful or wrongful on the part of the trustee, so far as the present controversy is concerned. It was adopted and sanctioned by Mrs. Blagge, as an investment properly made, and upon the identical trusts created by the will of Mrs. Hall, and authorized in the substituted estate by the resolve. In making her own will, and therein devising the New7 London estate, Mrs. Blagge manifestly intended to execute the power reserved to her, (in conformity to the original trusts,) contained in the deeds of these estates to Price. - She had no other right or title in or over the same to give effect to her devise; and this devise must, therefore, if at all, take effect solely as an execution of this power over the substituted property, as to this estate; and in this respect, then, the case falls directly within the rule already adverted to. It is a case, where, although the power is not referred to in terms, yet the subject matter is expressly disposed of, and the will is void and inoperative, except as an execution of the power.\nThe whole question is then nan-owed down to the mere consideration, -whether Mrs. Blagge intended a mere partial execution of the po-wer, -quoad the New London estate, or meant a full and entire execution of the \u25a0whole power over all the property, to which it -was attached. She speaks of this estate indeed as her own estate, \u201cmy house and land lying in New London;\u201d but this does not change the proper interpretation of the words. The language is precisely that, which would ordinarily be used by the donee of a power, absolutely to dispose of the whole property, although without any interest in the property. Lord Loughborough, in Standen v. Standen, 2 Ves. Jr. 589, alluded to such a form of disposition, as not producing the slightest difficulty in construing the devise to be an execution of a pow7er; and this is certainly now7 the received doctrine. But the true bearing of this language in this clause of the will of Mrs. Blagge most strongly applies to illustrate her meaning in the residuary clause, to which I shall presently allude. She treats the New7 London estate as her owrn property; but it w7as her own in the same sense, and in that only, as the other part of the unsold property, devised to her by the will of Mrs. Hall, that is, her property, as possessing the absolute pow7er to dispose of it by her owrn will.\nNow, immediately after the devise of the New London estate comes the residuary clause. \u201cAll the rest and residue of my estate of every nature and kind, I give, devise, and bequeath, as follows: viz. one third part to my daughter, Sarah Miles, and her heirs for ever; one third part to my- daughter, Margaret C. Drane, and her heirs, for ever; one third part to my daughter, Eliza J. Caldwell, and her heirs and assigns, for ever.\u201d I do not dwell upon the circumstance, that here the language used, \u201cheirs and assigns,\u201d applies peculiarly and emphatically to a devise of real estate: nor do I contrast it with the peculiar language in the numerous pecuniary legacies, named in the preceding part of the will, where the words \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d are wholly omitted. Nor do I rely upon the fact, that the personal estate of Mrs. Blagge at her death, was insufficient to discharge these legacies; for that circumstance alone would not affect the present question; as, from the nature and fluctuation of personal estate, the amount, which would be assets at the death \u25a0of the testatrix, must always be somewhat conjectural; and, on that account, has not, like real estate, been supposed to be within the contemplation of the testatrix as a specific bequest. Sugd. Powers (6th Ed.) c. 6, \u00a7 7, arts. 32, 33, pp. 393, 394; Andrews v. Emmot, 2 Brown, Ch. 297; Standen v. Standen, 2 Ves. Jr. 594; Doe v. Roake, 2 Bing. 497, 510; Jones v. Curry, 1 Swanst. 66, 71, 72.\nBut what may be relied upon is this, that Mrs. Blagge died possessed of no other real estate than that, which was attached to the power, and disposable by her under the same. Under such circumstances, if instead \u2022of the words \u201cthe residue of my estate of every name and nature,\u201d she had said, \u201cthe residue of my estate, real as well as personal,\u201d it was admitted at the argument, and, indeed, is conclusively established by the authorities, that the residuary clause would have operated upon the real estate, subject to the power, since in that way, and in that way alone, could it be operative. Sudg. Powers (6th Ed.) c. 6, \u00a7 7, arts. 33-38, pp. 393, 394. And, therefore, to effectuate the intent, it must be construed as a due \u25a0execution of the power. The case of Standen v. Standen, 2 Ves Jr. 589, which was affirmed in the house of lords, would be \u25a0dp'dsive on this point; and, indeed, it is but following out the principle of Sir Edward Clere\u2019s Case, 6 Coke, 18. See, also, Doe v. Roake, 2 Bing. 509, 510.\nThere is no doubt, that the words \u201call the residue of my estate of every nature - and kind,\u201d in Mrs. Blagge\u2019s will, are sufficient to pass real estate; and if she had left any interest in real estate, in her own right, that interest would have passed by the devise. This doctrine is clear upon the general principles applied to the interpretation of wills, and is also fully borne out by the authorities. It was admitted in Jones v. Curry, 1 Swanst 66, 72, 73, and recognized in the very recent case of Saumarez v. Saumerez, 4 Mylne & C. 340. See, also, Church v. Mundy, 15 Ves. 396, and Doe v. Morgan, 6 Barn. & C. 516. Still, however, as the word \u201cestate\u201d is nomen generalissimum, it may be satisfied by the mere bequest of personal property, if the testator has no real estate, upon which it can operate; and. therefore, a residuary clause of this sort is not, per se, decisive as an execution of a power, as it may operate without touching real estate in the power of the party, but not-in his interest.\nBut the view, which I take of the clause, is this, that it may include real estate, if the testator has any; and if the language then may justly admit of this interpretation, then we have a right to look to see, whether the testatrix did not, from other parts of the will, naturally, if not necessarily, mean to apply the residuary clause to real estate. If she did so intend, and it can be clearly seen, from the other provisions in the will, then it is the duty of the court to carry that intention into effect; and if it cannot be, except as an execution of the power, then it amounts to a due execution thereof. Now, it is precisely here, in my judgment, that the whole stress of the case lies. When I see, that1 Mrs. Blagge has, in the preceding clause of the will, executed the power, specifically, over certain real estate within the scope of the power, calling it \u201cmy house and land,\u201d and then immediately adding, \u201call the rest and residue of my estate of every nature and kind,\u201d it is plain to me, that she contemplated all the real estate within the scope of the power, as her own estate, and subject to her own absolute disposal, and that she intended to dispose of all of it by her will, by the very words, which she has used. I am not bold enough to fritter away such an intention, coupled with such acts, by resorting to any technical niceties and refinements. They partake too much of subtlety, and artificial distinctions, (and I say it with the utmost deference for other judgments,) to suit a just or even a reasonable administration of private justice. The case of Walker v. Mackie, 4 Russ. 76, was one of far less stringent circumstances; and yet the then master of the rolls (Sir John Leach) held the will a good execution of the power. In that case, the testatrix had power to appoint, by will, a certain leasehold estate, and certain 3 per cent, stock, standing in the name of the accountant general in chancery, she being entitled to both during her life. By her will, after certain pecuniary legacies, she gave \u201cAll the rest and residue of her bank stock to her daughter A., with her wearing apparel, goods, and chattels of every kind whatsoever, and all other property she possessed at the time of her decease, excepting \u00a350 of her bank stock, which she gave there-out to her executors.\u201d It was proved, that she had no bank stock, nor any stock whatsoever, except the stock in court. The master of the rolls held, that the will was a due execution of the 3 per cent, stock, and also of the leasehold estate. I am aware, that in a later case (Hughes v. Turner, 3 Mylne & K. 666, 697), his successor (Sir C. C. Pepys) disapproved of that decision. But I confess, that I am not prepared to join in this disapproval; and it be not reconcilable with Webb v. Honnor, 1 Jac. & W. 352, or rather with a dictum of Sir Thomas Plumer in that case, I am not at all disposed to surrender to the authority of the latter. See Sir Edward Sug-den's remarks on this latter case. 1 Sugd. Powers (6th Ed.) c. 6, \u00a7 7, art. 28, p. 390. Be this as it may, the present case differs from all these three cases in its circumstances, and, therefore, is not governed by the authority of either of them, whatever may be their weight.\nNOTE (from original report]. It may not be unimportant to state, that all these refined and subtile distinctions, in relation to the execution of powers, are now swept away in England by the statute of wills (7 Wm. IV., and 1 Viet, c. 26, \u00a7 27), which has declared, that a general devise of real or personal estate, shall operate as an execution of a power of the testator over the same, unless a contrary intention shall appear on the will. The doctrine, therefore, has at last settled down in that country, to what would seem to be the dictate of common sense, unaffected by technical niceties. J. S.\nThe judgment of Sir Thomas Plumer, M. R., in Jones v. Curry, 1 Swanst. 66, has been greatly relied on, at the argument, as directly in point against the present case being a due execution of the power. I have already had occasion to suggest, that it is not so in point; but is fairly distinguishable in its circumstances. The language there was not the same, nor the power the same, nor the facts the same. There seems to me to be great force in the criticism of Sir Edward Sugden on that case. If the words were not sufficient to pass real estate, (which they clearly were,) the point did not arise. If they were sufficient, the case does not appear to have been well decided; for if they were sufficient to pass real estate, and the testatrix had none but under the power, then it might plainly be presumed, that she intended to pass real estate by her will; and if so, it could only be by an execution of the power. Sugd. Powers, (6th Ed.) c. 6, \u00a7 7, p. 425. Besides; Sir Thomas Plu-mer, in that case, strongly relied upon the fact, that there was no language in the will of the testatrix, which showed any intention to execute the power, even in relation to the personalty. There was no clear case of an intended part execution of the power. Here, the contrary is established; and the testatrix has executed her power as to the New London estate. And I cannot but consider the language of Sir William Grant, in Bennett v. Aburrow, 8 Ves. 609, 616, to contain the true doctrine; and it is strictly applicable to the present case. \u201cThis, (said that great judge,) is always a question of intention, whether the party meant to execute the power, or not. Formerly it was sometimes required that there should be an express reference to the power. But that is not necessary now. The intention may be collected from other circumstances; as, that the will includes something the party had not otherwise, than under tne power of appointment; that a part of the will would be wholly inoperative, unless applied to the power.\u201d\nUpon the whole, my opinion is, that the will of Mrs. Blagge was a complete execution of the power, as to the premises in question; and, therefore, that judgment ought to be entered for the tenant"},{"case_name":"The State of Maryland, use of Washington County, vs. The Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1676110\/","date":"1842-12-01","court":"Court of Appeals of Maryland","content":"Stephen, J.,\ndelivered the opinion of this court.\nThis is an action of debt, instituted in the name of the State of Maryland, for the use of Washington county, to recover the sum of one million of dollars, claimed by the county from the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company, for an alleged violation of contract contained in one of the provisions of its charter.\nIn bar of any recovery in this suit, the appellee has pleaded, that nothing is due to the county; and also, the act of Assembly annulling the obligation and releasing the forfeiture, in virtue of which the said sum of money is alleged to be due.\nThe controversy between the parties is one of considerable magnitude, not only as regards the sum involved in'the litigation, but on account of the aspect it has assumed, as a ques- lion involving grave considerations of constitutional law. The case has been argued with great legal learning and ability by the distinguished counsel employed to advocate the cause of the respective parties, and the court have derived no small degree of assistance in coming to the result at which they have arrived, from the light which has been shed upon the subject in the course of the discussion.\nOn the part of the appellant, it has been treated in the course of the argument as a clear case of contract, covered by a constitutional sanction, and therefore inviolable by legislative interference; on that of the appellee, it has with a confidence seemingly and no doubt really, equally sincere, been treated as a clear case of penalty, and therefore subject to legislative control, and free from constitutional difficulty.\nWe have considered with that care and attention which the importance of the subject demanded, the arguments which have been urged on both sides of the question, and have come to the conclusion that, according to the true construction of the act of the Legislature from which the controversy has arisen, it is not a case of contract, the obligation of which has been impaired by legislative interference, but a ease of penalty, and therefore subject, as to its enforcement, to the will and pleasure of the Legislature. It is a rule in the exposition of statutes, that the will of the Legislature is to be regarded, and to be carried into effect, so far as they keep within the limits prescribed to them by the Constitution or fundamental law, and in ascertaining such will or intention, the well established rule is, that \u201cif divers statutes relate to the same thing, they ought to be all taken into consideration in construing any one of them.\u201d For this principle, sec 6 Bacon\u2019s Abr. 382. And so far has this rule been carried, that it is held to apply, although one of them may have expired. For which doctrine, see also the same book, 383, where it is said \u2014 -\u201cit is a rule in the construction of statutes, that all which relate to the same subject, notwithstanding some of them may be expired, or are not referred to, must be taken to be one system, and construed consistently,\u201d Adopting this rule in the case now before this court, as a legi timate test or standard by which to indicate the legislative mind, we think the inference will be found to be well warranted, that the duty imposed upon the appellee of locating the road through Cumberland, Hagerstown and Boonsborough, was intended to be enforced, not by the obligation of contract, but by the sanction of penalty alone. The language of the 5th section of the act of 1835, chap. 395, is as follows: \u201cand it is hereby declared to be and made the duty of the said company to, and they shall so locate and contract the said road, as to pass through each of the said places\u201cProvided, that if the said Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company shall not locate the said road in the manner provided for in this act, then and in that case they shall forfeit one million of dollars to the State of Maryland, for the use of Washington county.\u201d It is another well settled rule in the construction of a statute, that \u201cthe words are to be taken in their natural and ordinary signification and import, and if technical words are used, they are to be taken in a technical sense.\u201d 1 Kent\u2019s Com. 462.\nApplying these principles of interpretation to the case before us, and we think the conclusion is well warranted, that penalty and not contract was in the contemplation of the Legislature when they enacted the fifth section of the act of 1835, upon which this suit has been instituted, in case of non-compliance with the requirements of the law, the company is to forfeit one million of dollars to the State, for the use of Washington county. The term forfeit, in common parlance, strongly implies penalty, and such appears to be the import ascribed to it by lexicographers of the highest respectability, in giving with precision and accuracy, the meaning of our language. Mr. Webster defines the word forfeit to be that which is forfeited or lost by neglect of duty, or in other words, a fine, a mulct, a penalty. The language, moreover, is not that of convention or contract, but is mandatory in its character. It is the language of the creator to the creature, enjoining a duty to be performed, and imposing a penalty or forfeiture for disobedience or neglect. It is therefore, we think, in every view and aspect under which it could be considered, penal and not con ventional, according to its sound and true interpretation. In this sense it appears to have been understood by the Legislature when they passed the act of 1840, chap. 260. In that act they say, \u201cthat so much of the 5th section of the act of 1835 as makes it the duty of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company to construct the said road so as to pass through Hagerstown and Boonsborough, be and the same is hereby repealed; and that the forfeiture of one million of dollars reserved to the State of Maryland as a penalty, in case the said Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company shall not locate the said road in the manner provided for in that act, be and the same is hereby remitted and released; and any suit instituted to recover the same sum of one million of dollars, or any part thereof, be and the same is hereby declared to be discontinued and of no effect.\u201d In this law, the forfeiture to the State is emphatically termed a penalty, imposed for not locating the road as prescribed by the act of 1835, and although the right of expounding laws belongs to a different department of the government, and is not embraced wdthin the sphere of the legislative power, still the sense of the Legislature upon the subject of laws enacted by themselves, when of doubtful import, is a circumstance not, we think, entirely to be disregarded. In speaking of the rule that several acts in pari materia, and relating to the same subject, are to be taken together and construed as one system, Chancellor Kent says \u2014 \u201cthe object of the rule is to ascertain and carry into effect the intention; and it is to be inferred, that a code of statutes relating to one subject, was governed by one spirit and policy, and vras intended to be consistent and harmonious in its several parts and provisions.\u201d See 1 Kent's Com. 463, 464. Much stress was laid in the course of the argument upon the first section of the act of 1835, which requires the assent of the company to the provisions of that law, as indicating that the fifth section should be construed to operate as contract, and not as penalty. The term assent, mentioned in that section, it was said, is a word peculiarly appropriate to contract, and not to penalty or forfeiture. This js certainly true as a general proposition, and need not be con troverted to elude or avoid the force of the argument upon the present occasion. The assent of the company was essential to give to the law a binding and obligatory force; the principle being well settled, that an act or charter of incorporation is nothing more than an offer until consummated by acceptance, and in that sense and for that purpose it was manifestly used in the first sectio'n of the act. It was assented to in that sense alone-which it ought to receive, according to its sound and genuine interpretation; and to give to the term a different import, would be a perversion of the purpose for which it was adopted. As a further proof that the fifth section ought to be construed as creating a penalty and not contract, it may be useful to refer to the ninth section of the same act, where the language of contract is clearly and unequivocally adopted. The terms there used are peculiarly appropriate for that purpose, and are so expressive or significative of that intent, as to leave not a shadow of doubt upon the subject. The expression there used, \u201cstipulate, agree and bind the said company,\u201d speak a language too explicit to be misunderstood, and remove every shadow of doubt as to the intent. Now is this the only instance in which the Legislature have spoken an unequivocal language, when they intended to bind the company by the solemnities or obligation of contract. In the third section of the act of 1827, chap. 104, expressions of similar import, are carefully used to create the obligations of contract instead of penalty; and that too in relation to the same subject, as the one embraced by the fifth section of the act of 1835, out of which this controversy has arisen, and if it was designed to deal with the company in the same manner, and to impose upon them the same duties and obligations, to be fulfilled under a similar responsibility in the 5th section of the act of 1835, it is difficult to conceive, why the appropriate language to execute that intent was abandoned, and terms of more equivocal import adopted. In the third section above refered to, after specifying certain conditions, upon the performance of which, the Treasurer should be authorised to subscribe on behalf of the State, the Legislature insert the following proviso: \u201cAnd provided also, that the President and Directors of the said company shall agree so to locate said road, that it shall go to, or strike the Potomac river at some point between the mouth of the Monocacy river and the town of Cumberland, in Allegany county, and that it shall go into Frederick, Washington and Allegany counties; and provided also, before such subscription is made, the President and Directors of the said company shall, in writing to be approved by the Attorney General, bind the said company to allow the State to subscribe for the remaining five thousand shares on the same terms, at any time during the session of the next General Assembly.\u201d Here it is not made the duty of the company to locate the road in a particular direction, under a forfeiture for non-performance or neglect, as in the 5th section of the act of 1835; but in the language of contract, they are made to agree so to locate it, that it shall go into Frederick, Washington and Allegany counties, and in reference to the State\u2019s right of future subscription, it is still more apparent with what anxious solicitude the solemnities and binding efficacy of contract are preserved in the same section; upon that subject, the company was to be bound by a written instrument, which was not to be deemed satisfactory until it had received the sanction of the law officer of the State. It is moreover to be observed, that when at a subsequent period, it was found necessary, in consequence of a conflict of route with the canal company, to release conditionally the rail road company from their contract, as entered into by the act of 1827, the law by which they were discharged, bolds the same language, and speaks of it as a condition or agreement from which they were released.\nIf then, the duly imposed by the 5th section of the act of 1835, was intended to be enforced by penalty, and not by contract, the next question to be considered is, were the Legislature competent to release the penalty in the manner they have done, by the act of 1840, chap. 260? In the exercise of such a jurisdiction, the Legislature are restained by no constitutional prohibition. The releasing act could not be deemed an ex post facto law in the sense of the Constitution, nor could it be considered as impairing the obligation of a contract; indeedit was not attempted to be impugned upon either of these grounds in the course of the argument, but was exclusively assailed upon the ground that the act of 1835 provided for a case of contract, and not penalty; and that therefore, the act of 1840 was a violation of the constitutional inhibition, forbidding the State Legislatures from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts. The money being forfeited to the State as 'a penalty for the use of Washington county, one of the constituent elements of the State, the Legislature had an unquestionable right to remit it. Washington county is an integral part of the State, or portion of the body politic, and the money, if received by her, would belong to her as public property in her public political capacity, to be applied exclusively to the public use. As a county, she stands to the State in the relation of a child to a parent, subject in all respects to its jurisdiction and power, as well as entitled to the benefits of its fostering care and protection. As a member of the political family, she has a right to participate in the legislative councils of the country; but the will of the majority, when expressed, according to the forms of the constitution, is binding and obligatory upon her, and to that will, as the rule of her conduct, she is bound to submit with becoming deference and respect. Several instances were referred to in the course of the argument, where it appears that a similar jurisdiction has been exercised by some of our sister States, but it is deemed unnecessary more particularly to refer to them. If then the act of 1840, releasing the penalty, was a legitimate exercise of power, and it was within the constitutional competency of the Legislature to pass it, what was the effect of that law upon the rights of the plaintiff, as to the further prosecution of her suit, and did it operate to bar the recovery of the penalty which was remitted by it ? Upon that part of the case we think no doubt can be entertained, as all the authorities referred to seem to speak one uniform language upon the subject; they all agree that no penalty incurred during the continuance of a law, can be enforced after its expiration or repeal, without a saving clause or some special provision to that effect. In 1 Kent\u2019s Com. 465, the principle is stated to be that, \u201cif an act be penal and temporary by the terms or nature of it, the party offending must be prosecuted and punished before the act expires, orbe repealed. Though the offence be committed before the expiration of the act, the party cannot be punished after it has expired, unless a particular provision be made by law for the purpose.\u201d To the same effect see 5 Cranch, 283, where Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the court says \u2014 \u201cThe court is, therefore, of opinion, that this cause is to be considered as if no sentence had been pronounced; and if no sentence had been pronounced, it has been long settled on general principles, that after the expiration or repeal of a law, no penalty can be enforced, nor punishment inflicted, for violations of the law committed while it was in force, unless some special provision be made for that purpose by statute.\u201d Many other authorities might be referred to in support of the same principle, but the rule seems to be so well settled, that it is deemed unnecessary to do so. If this, therefore, is to be deemed a case of penalty, and not one of contract, the act of 1840 seems to operate as a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, and the judgment of the court below ought to be affirmed.\nBut supposing that the views heretofore expressed upon the merits of this controversy are not well founded, and that it is to be deemed a case of contract and not penalty; is it a contract coming within the purview of the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits a State from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts, and was the act of 1840 therefore a nullity? In order to arrive at a just conclusion upon that subject, it is material to consider who are the contracting parties, and in what relation does the cestui que use stand to the legal plaintiff upon the record? The contracting parties are the State on the one part, and the rail road company on the other. The consideration of the contract were the franchises and privileges derived by the company from the State, and the cestui que use is one of the counties of the State, claiming an interest incidentally in her political character and capa city, in virtue of one of the provisions contained in that contract ? The State, for reasons which she deemed sufficient, has thought proper, by an act of her Legislature, to annul the contract and release the claim of the cestui que use, which this action has been instituted to enforce; and it is now contended on the part of the appellant in support of it, that such legislative act is a nullity, because it violates that great moral sanction of the Constitution, which declares, that no State shall pass any law which impairs the obligation of contracts. To declare an act of a co-ordinate department of the government an unwarrantable assumption or usurpation of power, because it is a violation of a constitutional prohibition, is an exercise of the judicial office, of a grave and delicate nature, which never can be warranted but in a clear case; but however painful and unpleasant the task may be, it is a duty enjoined upon the courts of justice sometimes to execute it, under the solemn sanctions of an oath, which they are not at liberty to overlook or disregard. In the case, however, which we now have to decide, we have no such duty to perform, because we think the Legislature have not transcended their constitutional limits in passing the act of 1840, by which they released the claim of the plaintiff, and discontinued the action which was brought to enforce it. Washington county, by which the claim is attempted to be enforced, is one of the public territorial divisions of the State, established for public political purposes, connected with the administration of the government. In that character she would receive the money as public property, to be used for public purposes only, and not for the use of her citizens in their private individual characters and capacities. In that relation they would have no immediate interest, and could assert no title. She is one of the instruments of the government, invested with a local jurisdiction to aid in the administration of public affairs, and may be emphatically termed a part of the State itself. If then it be public, and not private property, it would seem to be completely at the disposal of the government, and the act of 1840 was nothing more than a rightful exercise of legislative power. In the forty-fourth num bcr of the Federalist, a work of distinguished merit and ability, written principally by two eminent members of that convention of enlightened men, by whom the Constitution of the United States was formed, Mr. Madison, speaking of that principle contained in it, wdiich prohibits the States from passing any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, uses the following language as indicating his understanding of the views of the convention when they adopted that prohibitory clause of the Constitution \u2014 \u201cThe two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the State Constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that additional defences against these dangers ought not to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights.\u201d In 2 Dallas, 320, Judge Patterson, who was also a member of the convention by which the Constitution was formed, speaking of the import of the same constitutional restriction upon State legislative power, expresses himself in the following terms: \u201cOver public property they have a disposing and controling power, over private property they have none, except perhaps in certain cases, and those under restrictions; and except also what may arise from the enactment and operation of general laws respecting property, which will affect themselves as well as their constituents.\u201d In 2 Kent's Com. 275, Chancellor Kent says : \u201cPublic corporations are such as are created by the government for political purposes, as counties, cities, towns and villages, and the whole interest in them belongs to the public.\u201d In the Dartmouth College case, the Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion of the court, observed, that the provision in the Constitution never had been understood to embrace other contracts than those which respect property or some object of value, and confer rights which may be asserted in a court of justice. Dartmouth College was a private eleemosynary institution, endowed with a capacity to take property for objects unconnected with the government, and its funds were bestowed by individuals on the faith of the charter, and those funds consisted entirely of private donations. The corporation was not invested with any portion of political power, nor did it partake in any degree, in the administration of civil government. A contract of that kind he held to be within the purview and protection of the Constitution. In 9 Cranch, 52, Mr. Justice Story, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cIn respect also to public corporations, which exist only for public purposes, such as counties, towns, cities, &c., the Legislature may, under proper limitations, have a right to change, modify, enlarge or restrain them, securing, however, the property for the use, of those, for whom, and at whose expense, it was orginally purchased.\u201d In 9 Gill & John. Rep., 401, this court express themselves to the same effect, where they say: \u201cPublic corporations are to be governed according to the laws of the land, and the government has the sole right, as trustee of the public interest, to inspect, regulate, control and direct the corporation, its funds and franchises. That is of the essence of a public corporation.\u201d Again, in page 397 of the same book, it is said: \u201cA public corporation is one that is created for political purposes, with political powers, to be exercised for purposes connected with the public good in the administration of civil government; an instrument of the government, subject to the control of the Legislature, and its members, and officers of the government for the administration or discharge of public duties, as in the cases of cities, towns, &e.\u201d\nIn 1804, the justices of the levy courts of the respective counties were incorporated, and all property belonging to any county, or appropriated to any county use or purpose, was vested in them for the benefit of the county; and by an act passed in 1829, chap. 21, commissioners are directed to be chosen biennially by the voters of the county of Washington, who are likewise incorporated, and in whom the same powers and privileges are vested, as were given to the justices of the levy courts by the act of 1804, and all property belonging to the county or appropriated to its use, is in like manner vested in the said commissioners. The money then for which this suit has been brought, if recovered, would be vested in this body coporate, as a public corporation, for public or county purposes, and would not be private property, belonging to the citizens of the county in their individual rights or private capacities. It Would be held by the commissioners as public property given by the State, to be used only under legislative authority, for public purposes, and be subject in their hands, in all respects whatsoever, to the controling power and jurisdiction of the Legislature.\nIt is a circumstance moreover worthy of consideration, as indicating the public, character of these commissioners, and the official relation in which they stand to the government as public agents, that the act of incorporation provides, that in case of death, resignation, refusal to act, or removal from the county, the vacancy so occasioned, shall be filled by the Executive of the State, until a new election shall take place.\nTo put the question in a still stronger light, let it be supposed for the sake of the argument, that the one million of dollars had been appropriated as a forfeiture to the use of the Eastern Shore of Maryland., one of the two great divisions of the State, could it be contended with any semblance of reason or propriety, that a remission of the penalty by the State would not be a legitimate exercise of legislative power? Or to put the question in a still clearer point of view, suppose the money had been appropriated to the use and benefit of all the counties of the State, designating each of them by their respective names, (which would be substantially to the use of the State,) could it be successfully maintained, that the government, if the public good required it, would have no right to remit the forfeiture ? And if it could be lawfully done, where the interests of all would be involved, upon what principle of sound reasoning could it be urged, that the same power and jurisdiction would not exist, where the rights of one alone would be concerned ? If the interest of Washington county could be merged in the public good in association with her sister counties, without a violation o\u00ed constitutional law, where? reasons of State policy required the sacrifice to be made upon the altar of the general welfare, it is difficult to conceive upon what ground of fair reasoning a similar power could be denied to exist, where her interest alone, in her separate capacity, should be offered up as a victim, to attain the same object. A jurisdiction which would be rightfully exercised in the one case, could not be wrongfully exerted in the other.\nUnder every view, therefore, which we have been able to take of this case, we think that the claim of the appellants is wholly groundless and untenable, and that the judgment of the court below ought to be affirmed.\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED."},{"case_name":"Blenon\u2019s Estate","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4969372\/","date":"1843-04-17","court":"Supreme Court of Pennsylvania","content":"The following elaborate and learned opinion was delivered by\nBaldwin, J.\n\u2014 This case arises on the will of Sarah Zane, a member of the society of friends, who in the body thereof, describes herself as of the city of Philadelphia: she died in Virginia, but as it has not been questioned, we shall assume this to have been the place of her domicil at the time of her death; the law of the state must therefore govern her disposition of her personal property, as well as of her real estate situated here. 1 Binn. 336, 44; 3 R. 318; 3 Penn. Rep. 187, 8.\nThe questions which have been made in the argument, and those which necessarily afise in the case, are of the most interesting kind; involving the capacity of the Quaker societies of this and other states, to take real or personal estate by devise, without a charter of incorporation; their right to enjoy it for their own use, as a body united for the purposes of religion, charity and education; and what now are, by the Jaw of the land, pious and charitable uses, for which valid donations can be made by deed or will.\nIn referring to the history of the settlement of this state, the principles of its first settlers, the character of its founder, his systems and institutions, it would seem not a little surprising, that such questions could have remained open till this time: if there are any subjects on which the law could be supposed to be settled, it would be the rights of religious societies and charitable establishments. If there was any part of the law of England which could be congenial to the spirit and policy of the colony, and likely to be adopted by a society of men who sought an asylum from persecution for religious opinion, it would be that which would afford the best protection in the enjoyment of their rights, privileges, immunities and estates, as a religious society. If there were any laws which they would be disposed to leave behind them, they would be those which grew out of feudal tenures, a spirit of persecution, or an established religion; the last laws which they would introduce, would be those which created a forfeiture of all land conveyed to a society incorporated for the purposes of charity and religious worship, according to their own consciences, without regard to the mode of celebrating divine service as prescribed by law, or which prevent a donation for such uses from taking effect, without a special license by charter or act of assembly. Such would be the natural conclusion from the known and practical principles of civil and religious liberty, which have distinguished the policy and jurisprudence of this state through all time, as founded on a system of \u201cfree and unlimited Catholicism\u201d in matters of religion, of expanded benevolence in matters of charity, and equality of rights in the enjoyment of property.\nThese leading features are so strongly impressed on the written laws, and enter so deeply into the customs and common law of the state, as to make it impossible to mistake the character and tendency of the system in the details of its legislation, by colonial authority, or the adoption of the statutes or common law of England. It is not conceivable that the Quaker settlers of this province should have introduced those laws of .the mother country, which would incapacitate them as individuals, or a religious society, from taking, holding or enjoying property as a matter of right without a charter; or expose to a forfeiture to the proprietor, or mesne landlord, lands conveyed to them for the purposes of sepulture, religious worship, or charity, and above all, that William Penn should have adopted the statutes of Henry VIII. declaring the celebration of divine service according to the rites of the catholic church, to be superstitious, and conveyances for its use illegal and void; and the statutes of mortmain which make the enjoyment of property by a religious body, dependent on the pleasure and permission of the lord of the fee; while at the same time he excludes the statute of the 43 Eliz., and the mild and beneficent principles of the common law which that statute has been held to have restored.\nThe history of the society of Quakers, presents no instance of an incorporation: \u2014 did they adopt any rule of law, making one necessary to give them a legal capacity to purchase property\"? They have enjoyed it from the earliest time without a license in mortmain \u2014 is it liable to be now seized by the state as forfeited by the purchaser ? They have their own modes of worship and system of charities \u2014 are donations for their support to be regulated by the prohibitory statutes of a foreign country, or confined to the uses specified in its laws? 2 Ves. Sen. 475. They have kindred societies in other states \u2014 do the laws of this invalidate a bequest of money to them for purposes of piety and charity 1 These are questions which have been made by the counsel in their objections to the devise of the lot of ground to the yearly meeting of Philadelphia, and the pecuniary bequests to the several meetings of friends in this place, and in Maryland, Virginia and Ohio. The objections to the validity of the dispositions of this will, are not founded on any statutory law of Pennsylvania, but on the English statutes of mortmain, superstitious uses, and wills, alleged to be in force in this state by usage, though not adopted by any act of assembly. The principles of the common law have also been relied on, as supporting the objection to the capacity of the parties to take, for the want of an incorporation, as well as of an act of assembly, containing enabling provisions, analogous to the 43 Eliz., validating dispositions for religious, literary and charitable purposes, and giving jurisdiction to the courts to carry them into effect, as they can do in England.\nThe field of investigation is from its nature a broad -one, and from the confined course which has been taken in discussing the law of charities in the various cases which have arisen is, in a great measure, a new one.\nThough there are several statutes on the subject in England, prior to the 43 Eliz., no treatise or opinion contains a condensed or comparative view of the system of charities, which has grown out of them, so as to enable us by any authority of precedent, or adjudication, to ascertain the definite source of the various principles, which have from time to time, become embodied into the general course of the law of England. Nor have the courts of the United States, or of this state, brought into contrast or comparison, either the policy of the government of England and this country, in relation to religious establishments and rights of conscience, the general course of legislation pursued in either, or the principles of the common law independent of the statutes alluded to.\nProceeding on the assumption that the 43 Eliz. was the only foundation on which charities could be supported, in opposition to prior statutes, and that statute not being considered in force here unless re-enacted, the courts in this country have laid down principles, which resting solely on such assumption, cannot be considered as authoritative in their conclusions, if on a more thorough examination the premises on which they depend should appear to be erroneous. We trust that a review of the course of their adjudication on charities will show that it has not become so settled as to be sanctioned by the maxim of \u201c communis error facit jus,\u201d or that in endeavouring to extract the rules which must govern the law of charities from the constitution of the Union and this state, its statutes and usages, and the statutes and common law of England, we violate the respect due to the decisions of courts of high authority.\nIt is at all times proper to discriminate between the question directly presented for the deliberate consideration of a court, on which they exercise their judgment, by a solemn adjudication; and those observations which are made by way of illustration, or mere declarations of what the law is, on any particular subject; the one is binding as authority, the other to be respected only as a mere opinion, or argument, which must hare its influence, but cannot be enforced on our judgment.\nIf the supreme judicial tribunal of the state, or the union, have judicially considered the statutes of mortmain to be in force, this court is bound to take the law as settled; but if they have merely declared them to be so, without making such opinion the basis of their, judgment, or have, in doing so, omitted to refer to the supreme law of the land, which bears on the question, this court may and ought to do what a higher one would do, notwithstanding any preconceived or expressed opinion \u2014 compare the constitution with the statutes, and be governed by the result.\nThe 3d section of the 3d article of the constitution of the United States prohibits a \u201c forfeiture for treason except during the life of the person at-tainted;\u201d the constitution of Pennsylvania extends the prohibition to all forfeitures by attainder, or felos de se, or death by casualties: it is at least worth the inquiry whether a forfeiture in fee is incurred by an alienation in mortmain; against which, no prohibition is to be found in any law of the state. In a word, whether a penal law of England has an effect, which the whole power of the federal and state government is incompetent to give to a conviction for the highest crimes known to their laws. 9 S. & R. 343.\nThis inquiry necessarily leads to an investigation of the common law, so as to find out whether these statutes are in affirmance or derogatory of its principles, which have been made the common law of the state so far as adopted or applicable to its policy; if they are of the latter character, then how have they become in force in Pennsylvania, and what is the evidence of their adoption by legislation or usage ? As these statutes impose a forfeiture of the whole estate conveyed, the proposition that they are in force here ought to be considered as an affirmative one to be made out by those who assert, that an act lawful by the common law, is prohibited by a statute. The penal laws of England have been presumed not to be in force here; the burden of proof has always been held to be on those who allege a forfeiture, by an act punishable only by statute; and it ought to be clear and conclusive, especially on subjects which affect the rights to the transmission and enjoyment of property.\nIf there was any one subject on which the founder, the legislature, and the people of the colony, from its first settlement, were governed by a settled, unyielding course of policy, it was to facilitate the transmission of estates, to secure their enjoyment, and disincumber them of all restraints attendant on feudal tenures, the forms of conveyance, the ceremonies of investiture, and most emphatically to protect them from the operation of all laws growing out of an established religion, which at all interfered with the rights of conscience or the perfect freedom of religious worship. Lyle v. Richards, 9 S. & R. 326, 334, 359.\nThe charter of privileges of 1701, the colonial laws, both the constitutions of 1776 and 1790, and the laws of the state, are in the same spirit which induced the people, in their first act of assuming independence, and establishing government by their own authority, to prescribe the following oath to the members of the convention who formed their first constitution: \u2014 \u201c That I will oppose any measure that shall or may in the least interfere with or obstruct the religious principle or practice of any of the good people of this province, as heretofore enjoyed.\u201d Conv. of Penn. 39. The constitution was in the spirit of this oath, and declared the rights of religious societies and corporate bodies held according to the usage of the colony to be inviolable ; we have, therefore, a plain rule of decision by the supreme law of the state, if the nature and extent of such usage can be judicially ascertained.\nThe enjoyment of real estate in perpetuity, by any body incorporated by a written charter, or one presumed by law from evidence of long possession and exercise of corporate franchises, is mortmain per se; if on a review of the legislation and custom of the colony before, and of the state after the revolution, it shall appear, that their rights have been the subject of the most continued favour, and their protection is provided for in the most explicit manner, it must be deemed conclusive evidence of the general policy of the state, at least, if it does not establish the utter incompatibility of any incapacity in any body of men not only to take, but to enjoy an estate to their own use, with the whole scope and tenor both of its written and common law.\nThe strong constitutional position, which has been assumed by the senior counsel of the respondent in this case, has induced us to examine it with a degree of attention equally called for by the magnitude of the questions involved, and by the conclusions which we have felt ourselves bound to adopt; in some respects at variance with the views of the judges of the supreme court of the United States as to the necessity of an actual incorporation to give the capacity to take; and of those of this state, to enable a corporation to enjoy an estate. We think, however, that it will be found to accord with all the great leading principles and rules which have been too firmly established by themselves to be now shaken, and that their minds would have come to the same conclusion as ours have done, if the same materials for investigation had been presented to them.\nIn reviewing the judicial history of this state, it is believed that there will be found no decision, that an incorporation is necessary to give to any association of individuals, the capacity of taking and enjoying an estate in perpetuity, either by the assumed name of the society, or by trustees for their use; if such a rule exists, it is only by the common law as adopted here.\nNeither is there an adjudged case, turning on the statutes of ihortmain, by which any estate has ever been vested in the commonwealth, by a forfeiture incurred in consequence of an alienation to a corporate body, without license, charter or law; or any evidence that such license was ever granted by the proprietary or governor, or any public grant made with a clause of non obstante statuto, in any patent, charter or act of assembly, under the colonial or state government; nor does the word mortmain appear on the statute book for one hundred and fifty years from the date of the charter to Penn.\nThis unbroken silence would have been taken as conclusive evidence that the British statutes were deemed wholly inapplicable to the fixed policy of the colony and state, its usage and fundamental laws, if the contrary opinion had not been expressed by the judges of the supreme court of the state, and adopted by the legislature at the present session. Hence arises the impor tance, as well as delicacy, of the questions involved in this cause; to consider them open after the declared opinion of both departments of the government, may seem to indicate a want of respect to their authority, but when we feel convinced that there is a law of higher obligation which must guide our judgment, we are bound to follow it.\nThe view which we feel constrained to take of the constitutions of 1701, 1776 and 1790, all of which remain in force, so far as respects the rights of property, conscience and religious worship, is this: that all bodies united for religious, charitable or literary purposes, though without a written charter or law, are to be considered as corporations by prescription, or the usage and common law of the state, with all the attributes and incidents of such corporations by the principles of the common law, and entitled to all rights which are conformable to the customs of the province. From this view it results, that if the statutes of mortmain apply to bodies whose charters are in existence, they apply equally to those whose charters are presumed from prescription: a brief summary of these provisions will show that they embrace all corporations of either kind.\nThe 9 Hen. III. ch. 36, declared gifts made to any religious house to be void, and that the land given should enure to the lord of the fee: the 7 Edw. I. prohibited all alienations in mortmain under a like forfeiture. These statutes were evaded by fictitious recoveries, till the 13 Edw. I. took away their effect: a new mode of evasion was then invented by conveyances in trust for uses in mortmain, so that the profits went to religious persons; the 15 Rich. II. extended the former statutes to such uses, and to all guilds, fraternities, towns, and cities which have perpetual community, and all others which have offices perpetual, though not people of religion. Keb. St. 5, 33, 46, 181; 1 Ruff. St. 9, 32, 100, 401, 2.\nThe 23 Hen. VIII. ch. 10, prohibited conveyances to any bodies not incorporated, for the use of churches, &c., to have obits perpetual or the continual service of a priest for ever, and declared them void, but there was an express saving of the right of devising in mortmain by the custom of cities and towns corporate. Keb. St. 403, 404; 2 Ruff. St. 171, 172.\nThe statute of wills of 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. contained an express exception of devises to corporations. Keb. St. 562; Ruff. 333, 4.\nSuch is the substance of the English statutes, which have been considered as the clogs upon dispositions, to pious and charitable uses, which have been removed by the 43 Eliz. in England: if the question of their application to the state of things in this colony was a new one, we should deem it apparent that they were never practically extended to it. \u201cIt is the true principle of colonization that the emigrants from the mother country carry with them such laws as are useful in their new situation, and none other.\u201d 3 Binn. 596.\nThat the law of charities as it rests on the 43 Eliz. is not only useful, but peculiarly adapted to the policy of the state is unquestioned; it is therefore difficult to account for the prevalence of the opinion that it is not in force, or that any statutes repugnant to its provisions, should have been considered as practically adopted: yet such is undoubtedly the apparent tendency of judicial opinion for the last twenty-five years.\nIn 1808, the judges of the supreme court, made a report to the legislature pursuant to a resolution calling on them to state, what English statutes were in force, in which they declare \u201cconveyances to superstitious uses absolutely void by these statutes, and Conveyances to corporations unless sanctioned by charter or act of assembly, to be so far void that they have no capacity to hold the estates for their own benefit, but subject to the right of the commonwealth, who may appropriate them at their own pleasure; in other words that such conveyances have no validity for the purpose of enabling the corporation to hold in mortmain.\u201d They consider them as standing on the same footing as conveyances to aliens. 3 Binn. 626; Leazure v. Hillegas, 7 S. & R. 319, 22.\nIn M'Girr v. Aaron, they declared a devise to an officiating priest, and his successors not being a corporation sole, was against the policy of the law, and void as tending to a perpetuity. 1 Penn. Rep. 51. In the case of the Methodist Churchy. Remington, they say \u2014 \u201cThe statutes of mortmain, too, which deprive corporations of the capacity to hold,\u201d &c., and consider the legislature as evincing \u201can evident jealousy of clerical monopoly,\u201d though they refer to no act in which it had been expressed. They also decided, that a conveyance for a religious society composed of members, a majority of whom resided out of the state, was not good under the law of 1730; and that the trust not being sanctioned by any legislative recognition, they would not lend their aid to carry it into effect. In Wilman v. Lex, they seem to take for granted, that at common law an incorporation was necessary to give a capacity to take and hold in perpetuity, 17 S. & R. 91; though it was dispensed with by the custom of the province. We should have felt bound by these opinions, if the court had taken a view of the constitution and legislation of the state on the subjects to which they relate, and given them a deliberate construction; but as they have not been called upon to declare the meaning of any, but the act of 1730, or of the provisions of any of the constitutions, it cannot be expected, that the law can be considered as settled until their provisions had been brought under judicial notice.\nIn the case of the Baptist Association v. Hart's Executors, the supreme court of the United States have decided that a bequest of personal property to the plaintiffs as trustees was not valid for want of an incorporation, at the time of the devise, 4 Wheat. 28; and the decision was approved in the case of Inglis v. The Trustees of the Sailor's Snug Harbour, 3 Pet. 114. This case was ruled according to the law of Virginia, in which state the 43 Eliz. had been repealed; we may therefore consider it as a case settling a question of a local, rather than of a general nature; it has not at any rate such an application to the law of Pennsylvania, as to control this case, if it should appear to be embraced in the provisions of any act of assembly or constitution of the state or to rest on its known and recognised usage.\nSo far as these opinions of both courts rest on general principles affecting this case, they are also open to all rules which have been laid down in other cases by the same authority, to which it is thought best to refer, before entering on a review of the general course of the law of England or of this state.\nThe last case which has arisen in the supreme court of the state, is the Methodist Church v. Remington. In giving their opinion, the chief justice uses this strong language, \u201cThe decision in Witman v. Lex, is full to the point, that a trust in favour of an incorporated religious or charitable society, is an available one.\u201d As the statute 15 Rich. II. expressly applied to conveyances in trust, or for the use of religious persons, in mortmain, we may consider this statute as not in force in this state; so that the objections growing out of the statutes of mortmain, will be confined to those of Hen. III. and Edw. \u00cd. In relation to superstitious uses, the court observe, \u2014 \u201c The present is not a superstitious use, and indeed it is not easy to see how there can be such a thing here, at least in the acceptation of the word by the British courts, who seem to have extended it to all uses which are not subordinate to the interest and will of the established church;\u201d so that an inquiry into this subject is not closed. In M\u2018Girr v. Aaron, there were no trustees, and though the court held the devise to an officiating priest void, because he was not a corporation; yet they declared it good in case of the congregation, though not incorporated, (1 Penn. Rep. 51, 52,) on the principle, that \u201ca gift to a charitable use shall not fail for want of a trustee, but vest as soon as the charity has acquired a capacity to take.\u201d As the bequest in the case of the baptist association failed only for the want of a trustee capable at the time of the devise, though there was an incorporation afterwards, we cannot consider it as authority in this state, where a different principle is established \u2014 the bequest would have been good according to M\u2018Girr v. Aaron.\nIn examining the decisions of the supreme court of the United States, which precede and follow the baptist case, it-appears, that they have established a different principle as to devises of real estate for charitable uses, or for the use of religious societies which are not incorporated; so as to leave that case applicable only to a bequest of money or personal property, even in Virginia. In Terrett v. Taylor, land in or near Alexandria, was conveyed to two persons, and the church-wardens of the parish for the time being, and their successors in office, for the use and benefit of the church in said parish; the deed was held to operate by way of estoppel, to confirm to the church and its privies, the perpetual and beneficial estate in the land, though it was not incorporated, and church-wardens were not capable of holding an inheritance in land by succession; 9 Cranch 43, 53; 9 Wheat. 455, 464. The court remark, \u201cAnd in our judgment, it would make no difference, whether the episcopal church were a voluntary society, or clothed with corporate powers, for in equity as to objects which the laws cannot but recognise as useful and meritorious, the same reason would exist for relief in the one case as the other. Laws enacted for religious purposes, evidently presuppose the existence of the episcopal church, with its general rights and authorities growing out of the common law;\u201d the church was capable of receiving endowments of land, and that the minister of the parish was during the incumbency, seized of the freehold of its inheritable property, as emphatically persona ecelesiee, and capable as a sole corporation of transmitting the inheritance to his successors; 9 Cranch 45, 46, 329; 9 Wheat. 455, 464. In Clark v. The Town of Paulet, they say, \u201cThe property was in fact and in law, generally purchased by the parishioners, or acquired by the benefactions of pious donors. The title thereto was indefensibly vested in the churches, or rather in their legal agents, 9 Cranch 49, or representatives entitled to lake the donation, 9 Cranch 329.\u201d \u201cThe true legal notion of a parish church, is a consecrated place, having attached to it the right of burial, and the administration of the sacraments. Every such church, of common right, ought to have manse and glebe, as a suitable endowment, and when there is a church actually in existence, a grant to it is in effect a grant to the parson and his successors, as an endowment to be held jure ecclesix.\u201d 9 Craneh 329; 9 Wheat. 464. The parson has a qualified fee, but the land becomes the perpetual inheritance of the church. 9 Craneh 47, 53, 329; Co. Lit. 341 a. b.; 2 Mass. Rep. 500.\nIn Beatty v. Kurtz, the court decided that the laying out and marking a lot in the plan of a town, \u201cfor the Lutheran church,\u201d was a good and valid disposition \u2014 though it was not then organized, and was never incorporated as a religious society, but was a voluntary association, acting in its general arrangement, by committees and trustees chosen from time to time; or any church actually in existence, or any grantee capable of taking. It was supported as a dedication of the lot to public and pious uses, and the enjoyment decreed to the committee of the society. 2 Pet. 580, 81, 83, 85. The court take a ground which applies with great force to the law and constitution of Pennsylvania, as will appear hereafter.\n\u201cThe bill of rights of Maryland gives validity to any sale, gift, lease or devise of any quantity of land, not exceeding two acres, for a church, meeting or other house of worship, and for a burying-ground, which shall be used, improved and enjoyed, only for such purposes. To this extent it recognises the doctrines of the statute of Eliz. for charitable uses, under which, it is well known, that such uses would be upheld, although there was no specific trustee or grantee.\u201d In the case of the town of Paulet, they laid down the principle, that they considered appropriations or dedications of property to particular or religious uses as an exception to the general rule, requiring a particular grantee, and like the dedication of a highway to the public. 9 Cranch 331; S. P. 2 Pet. 583. In M'Connell v. Lexington, they considered that the immemorial use of a spring, by the people of the town, as public property, was evidence of its original dedication, and decisive against a private claim to its exclusive use. 12 Wheat. 582. In Cincinnati v. White, the principle of these cases was affirmed to its fullest [extent, and the court add what is very important in the consideration of this case \u2014 that \u201c-the case of Beatty v. Kurtz did not turn on the bill of rights of Maryland or the statute of Eliz., but rested on more general principles of law.\u201d 6 Pet. 436, 7.\nTo trace these principles to their source in the early statutes and common law of England, is therefore in perfect accordance with the decisions of the tribunal to whose revision our opinion is subject; it is the more necessary in this case, as the general course of the law of England, as to the transmission and enjoyment of property, formed the law of the colony at its first settlement, and continued in force till repealed or altered by colonial authority. In ascertaining what these general principles are, it is our duty to adopt the rules of construction which have been established by the supreme court, in relation to charities, under the 43 Eliz., and to apply them to the laws and constitution of this state, and the other English statutes, which are analogous in their provisions and subject matter to that statute, in doing which we shall start upon premises wffiich must lead to correct results. The legislation of Pennsylvania will be first considered according to the rules of expounding statutes laid down in the Baptist Association v. Hart, and those which are the principles of the common law.\nIt is not to be denied,' that if any gifts are enumerated in this statute which were not previously valid, or for which no previous remedy existed, the statute makes them valid and furnishes a remedy. That there were such gifts, and that the statute has given them validity, has been repeatedly determined : the books are full of cases where conveyances to charitable uses which were void by the statutes of mortmain, or were in other respects so defective, that on general principles nothing passed, have been sustained under this statute. If this statute restores to its original capacity a conveyance rendered void by an act of the legislature, it will, of course, operate with equal effect on any legal objection to the gift which originates in any other manner, and which a statute can remove.

Moore 129, pl. 277; 4 Co. Rep. 105, 11, 13, 14; where the same deed contains a disposition partly .'superstitious, and pious and charitable in other parts, the latter are good, if not dependent on, and capable of being separated from the former. 4 Co.

Though hospitals are named in the statutes, they apply only to such as are religious or ecclesiastical, or the funds are to be devoted to purposes of superstition as specially defined and plainly prohibited: it shall not be made superstitious by construction or intendment \u2014 it must be plain and not imaginary, and no general words shall take away good and charitable gifts allowed by parliament, which are favoured in the law.

An affirmative statute does not take away a right existing by common law or custom, as the statute of wills, which did not affect the previous right to devise. Co. Litt. 111 b., 115 a.; 3 Co. Rep. 35 a.\nA custom saved and preserved by a statute is good against a statute: thus lands can be held in mortmain in London without license, because there is such a custom.; Croke Eliz. 455, and the customs of London are saved by acts of parliament and Magna Charta. 2 Co. Inst. 201; 4 Co. Inst. 250, 3; 5 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 20; Croke Eliz. 248, 455; W. Jones, 251, 387. A statute authorizing an act to be done, repeals a law prohibiting it; otherwise it would be a dead letter, in opposition to an established maxim that such construction shall be made of all acts, ut res majis valeat, quarnpereat, and reverse another unquestioned one, leges posteriores priores contraria abrogant. 6 Pet. 299. A grant by the king or an act of parliament, is an authority to hold the thing granted, and operates as a license dispensing with the performance of any other act required by any law against which the king may grant a license or dispensation ; though none is given in terms, it per se creates an incorporation, confers succession, and grants a rent; so if done by a private person under the authority of an act of parliament, as the erection of an hospital. 10 Co. Rep. 30, 25 a.; Plowd. 502. A clause of non obstante statutoy is not necessary to .save a forfeiture by the statutes of mortmain; it is inferred from the act of the king or the legislature in order to give it effect; 8 Co. Rep. 56: its only use is to show the king is not deceived; 4 Co. Rep. 36 a. Hence, it has always been held that the statutes did not apply to grants made by the king. 15 Vin. Abr. 479, A. 2. \u201cHe shall not be intended to be misconusant, and when he licenses expressly to alien to an abbot, &c., which is in mortmain, he need not make any \u00f1on obstante of the statute of mortmain, for it is apparent to be granted in mortmain,\u2019\u2019 the license of the king or mediate lords \u201c operates to two intents, as a dispensation from the statute of quia emptores, and of mortmain, because their deeds shall be taken most strongly against them, and the king shall not be presumed to make a void grant.\u2019\u2019 Co. Litt. 98 b., 99 a.; Plowd. 502; 8 Co. Rep. 56.\nWhere land is held immediately of the king, he may grant a license to alien in mortmain; if held mediately, it might be made by the mesne lord or with his consent; 34 Ed. I., ch. 3, Keb. St. 71; Ruff. St. 155. Since the 7 & 8 Will. III. he can do it without their consent. 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 298. As tenures in chivalry had been abolished by the statute 12 Car. II. the forfeiture accruing by alienation in mortmain, accrued only to the king, who may renounce by his license a right conferred on the crown. Co. Litt. 98, 99; Vaugh. 332,\nThe effect of a license in mortmain is not to give a capacity to a corporation to take or hold in mortmain. Conveyances in mortmain were good at common law. Co. Litt. 98-9; Vaugh. 356. A grant in frankalmoigne placed the lands in the hands of bodies which never died; the estate became dead as to the king, or mesne lords of whom they were holden; yielding neither escheats, -wardships, reliefs or other benefits; such grants were always good by deeds of private persons before the statutes, or by title of prescription, and are now good by the grant of the king. Litt. \u00a7 141, 2; Co. Litt. 98, 9; Co. Litt. 2 b.; Terms of the Law, 294; Plowd. 293; 6 Co. Rep. 17a. Notwithstanding the statutes, the estate vests by the conveyance, 7 S. & R. 320; they are founded on the capacity of the grantee to take, so that wherever they apply the conveyance would enable a corporation to hold at common law for its own use; for if the estate did not vest, it would remain in the hands of the grantor or his heirs, as in the case of a conveyance to super stitious uses, which are merely void without incurring any forfeiture, by the statutes of Hen. VIII. and Ed. VI.\nThe license therefore is only an exemption from the penalty of the statutes, Co. Litt. 52 b.; it restores an interest; 1 Freem. 117. It is an authority coupled with an interest, enabling the grantees to acquire and enjoy an inheritance to their own use, without incurring the forfeiture, and by a renunciation of the rights given by the statutes, leaves the estate in their hands as if they had never been passed. 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 297, b. 3; F. N. B. 222, 495, 500; 4 Co. Inst. 135; Co. Litt. 99 a.; Vaugh. 333, 356; and operates in favour of a society or body not incorporated by a charter, Vaugh. 351, 2; 7 Co. Rep. 35 b.; which is conclusive to show its previous capacity to take. All that can. be required then, to give the same capacity to hold as to take, and make the right to enjoy as perfect as to take an estate, is any .act of the party to whom the forfeiture accrues, which is in terms, or by its legal operation, a renunciation of a right conferred by law, which binds him and protects the estate from the assertion of his claim under the statutes; according to the established principle, that subsequent laws abrogate prior ones inconsistent with them, without any repealing clause, and will produce the same effect as a license in mortmain.\nIt is admitted that the king is bound by all acts of parliament in which he is named, so that he can exercise no power by statute, prerogative or tenure, in derogation of any right protected, or authority conferred by the statute: but, generally speaking, he is not bound unless its provisions extend to him, subject to these exceptions; all statutes which provide profitable remedy for the maintenance of religion, the advancement of good literature, and the relief of the poor, 11 Co. Rep. 71 b.; 5 Co. Rep. 14 a. b.; which suppress wrong and provide a remedy for a right, 2 Co. Inst. 142, 69, 359, 681; or tend to perform the will of a donor or founder, 11 Co. Rep. 72 a.; 5 Co. Rep. 14, 15; Plowd. 246 ; 3 Atk. 147, bind the king though not named. His claims to lands by escheat, forfeiture or wardship, are subject to all rights existing before they came to his hands; the law gives him a better remedy, but no better right, than the subject from whom the land came to his hands, 2 Co. Inst. 573; 2 Ves. Sen. 296, 7; Hardr. 69, 469; and the appropriate courts were authorized by the statute 33 Hen. VIII. ch. 39; Keb. St. 555; 2 Ruff. St. 324. to decide on the rights of a subject, in a controversy between him and the king, according to equity and good conscience, as between subject and subject; 7 Co. Rep. 19 b.; Hardr. 27, 176, 230, 502 ; 4 Co. Inst. 190.\nThese are the principles which have given to the 43 Eliz. its powerful effect; though it contains no repealing clause, license or non obstante statuto, yet, by universal consent, it has been held to repeal the statutes of mortmain, the exception of corporations in the statute of wills, and to restore the common law in all cases embraced in its provisions, or which can be brought within them by the most liberal and benign construction. 1 P. Wms. 248; Pr. Ch. 16; Gilb. Eq. 137; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 191; 3 Pet. 141.\nThese principles are admirably condensed by the supreme court in 4 Wheat. 31, and are those by which we must consider the legislation of Pennsylvania on the same subjects; we must hold its law to bind the state, and to dispense with the forfeiture accruing to it by an alienation in mortmain, if a similar law in England would bind the king. The prerogative of a repub lican state cannot be deemed, in a court of justice, more sacred than the jewels of a crown; or the rights of its citizens, individually or collectively, to the enjoyment of property, to be placed on a less permanent foundation than those of the subjects of a monarchy; nor can corporations be subject to disabilities here from which they are exempted by the general course of the law of England, between the spirit and policy of which, and that of Pennsylvania, there will be found a most marked difference in this respect.\nIn England, there has always been a jealousy of their rights to hold property; here, they will be found to have been favoured and protected by express provisions in the constitution and laws, while there is an entire absence of any restriction on their capacity to take or enjoy estates; there, the effect of statutes has been to remove disabilities interposed by former statutes, which abrogated common law rights; here, laws have been passed in affirmance of its principles, and they have been embodied in a supreme law. There, courts have gone to the- extent of their power, to rescue charities from the intolerant spirit of the times; here, their duty is to further the benevolent policy of the people and legislature as evidenced in all their acts.\nFrom the first settlement of the province, we find that the uniform tenor of its laws has been, to encourage all alienations of property, and to confirm its disposition, in every mode known to the law. The act of 1705 confirmed all sales of land made under the laws of the province, and declared that no deed, grant or assurance should be held defective on account of any want of form, of livery of seisin, attornment, misnomer or misreeital, but shall be good and effectual. 1 Dall. Laws, 51, 3; 1 Smith, 31. This law has always been in force. The act of 1711, confirmed all grants from the proprietor to any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, to hold the same for such estates and uses as they had .been sold or disposed of, notwithstanding any defects therein, and shall be expounded most beneficially for the grantee\u2019s, according to the words, tenor and true meaning thereof. 1 Dall. App. 39, 40. This law was repealed in council in 1713, but its principles have ever been respected. The\u2019 law of 1705 declared, that all wills whereby any lands were devised, should be good and available in law for granting, conveying, and assuring the lands devised and chattels bequeathed. 1 Dall. 53; 1 Smith 33; 1 Dall. App. 26, 36. The law of 1742 gives a remedy for the recovery \u201c of any legacy or bequest of any sum of money\u201d to any person or persons. Miller\u2019s Laws, 156; 1 Dall. 449, 631. Neither of these laws contain any exception of corporations.\nThe rights of conscience were declared inviolable by the charter of privileges of 1701, granted by William Penn to the people of the colony: no person who lived quietly under the government and acknowledged one God, should be in any case molested, or prejudiced in his estate, because of his conscientious persuasion; 1 Dall. App. 8, 10; and liberty of conscience was secured by a law approved in council. 1 Dall. 43, 4. In 1712, an act was passed empowering all religious societies of protestants within the province, to purchase and hold lands for burying grounds, houses of worship, schools and hospitals; and, by trustees or otherwise, as they shall think fit, to receive and take grants and conveyances for the same, for any estate whatever for the uses aforesaid. All sales, gifts or grants to such societies, or any persons in trust for them, were ratified and confirmed according to their tenor and meaning, and of the parties concerned. Gifts to the poor of these societies, or for their use, shall be employed only for the charitable uses for which they were given, according to what may be collected to be the true meaning of the donors or grantors, notwithstanding any failure in these gifts, grants or bequests. Bradford\u2019s Laws, 160. This law was repealed in council, twice enacted, and as often repealed. In 1710, the judges of the county, court were made a court of equity, authorized to proceed according to the rules and practice of the high court of chancery of Great Britain, and an appeal was given to the supreme court, with power to decree as may be agreeable to equity and justice; Bradf. Laws, 103, 120. Though this law was repealed in 1713, and courts of chancery discontinued in 1736, the rules and principles of equity have always formed part of the common law of the state.\nThe sixth article of the charter to Penn provided, that the laws for regulating and governing property within the province, as well as for the descent and enjoyment of lands and goods and chattels, should be and continue the same as they should be for the time being, by the general course of the law of England, till the same should be altered. 1 Dall. App. 3. The preamble to the act of 1718 recites, that it is a settled point, that as the common law. is the birth-right of English subjects, so it ought to be the rule in British colonies. But acts of parliament have been adjudged not to extend to these plantations, unless they are particularly named in such acts; 1 Dall. Laws, 129, 133; or, as has often been declared by the supreme court of the state, unless they are convenient, adapted to the circumstances of the colony, or have been in force by adoption, usage or long-continued practice, in courts of justice. 1 Dall. Rep. 67, 74; 3 Binn. 596-7; 1 Dall. Laws, 722.\nAfter repeated attempts to pass a law in favour of religious societies which would accord with the spirit of the colony, one was finally approved in council. The act of 1730-1 confirmed all sales, gifts and grants of land to any persons in trust for the use of any protestant religious society, for sites of churches, houses of religious worship, schools, almshouses and burying-grounds, made before the law; it also contained a provision which made it lawful in future, for any such society within the province to purchase, take, receive by gift, grant or otherwise, for the above specified uses and purposes, and for any estate whatsoever, and to hold the same for the said uses in fee, provided, that they should not take land for their maintenance or support, or for any other uses than those specified. 1 Dall. Laws, 270-3.\nThe constitution of 1776 declared, in the first section of the bill of rights> \u201c That all men have an equal right to acquire, possess and protect property;\u201d and in the eighth, \u201cThat every member of society hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property.\u201d 2. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience and understanding.\u201d 3. \u201cNor can any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be justly deprived or abridged of his civil rights as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worship, and that no authority is or ought to be vested in any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conscience in the free exercise of religious .worship.\u201d\nIn the frame of government, \u00a7 45, \u201cAnd all religious societies or bodies of m en, heretofore united or incorporated for the advancement of religion or learning, or for other pious and charitable purposes, shall be encouraged and protected in the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities and estates which they were accustomed to enjoy, or could of right have enjoyed under the laws or former constitution of the state.\u201d \u00a746. \u201cThe declaration of rights is hereby declared to be a part of the constitution of this commonwealth, and ought never to be violated on any pretence Whatever.\u201d 1 Dall. App. 55, 60 ; Convention of Pennsylvania, 55, 64.\nThe first law passed, on the change of government, declared the province laws in force till altered or repealed; also the common law, and such parts of the statute laws of England as had been before in force, \u2014 .\u201cAnd so much of any law or act of assembly as declares, orders, directs or commands any matter or thing repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the constitution, is hereby declared not to be revived, but shall be null and void, and of no force or effect.\u201d 1 Dall. Laws, 722.\nThe constitution of 1790, in art. 7, \u00a7 1, provides, \u201c That the legislature shall, as soon as may be, provide by law for the establishment of schools throughout the state, in such manner that the poor may be taught gratis.\u201d \u00a7 2. \u201c The arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more seminaries of learning.\u201d The 44th section of the old constitution contained similar provisions, though not so full. \u00a7 3. \u201c The rights, privileges, immunities and estates of religious societies and bodies corporate, shall remain as if the constitution of the state had not been altered or amended.\u201d The first three sections of the bill of rights are, in substance, the same as in the old one. The third concludes \u2014 \u201c and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or modes of worship.\u201d \u00a7 26. \u201cTo guard against the transgression of the high powers which we have delegated, we declare that every thing in this article is excepted out of the several powers of government, and shall for ever remain inviolate.\u201d In the first clause of the schedule it is ordained, \u201c That all laws of this commonwealth in force at the time of making the said alterations and amendments in the said constitution, and not' inconsistent 'therewith, and all rights, actions, prosecutions, claims and contracts, as well of ind ividuals as of bodies politic, shall continue as if the said alterations and amendments had not been made.\u201d 3 Dall. Laws, 32, 36. These provisions, and the law which immediately followed the adoption of the constitution, are a direct negative on the existence of any spirit of policy adverse to corporations.\nIn 1791, an act was passed \u201cto confer on certain associations of the citizens of this commonwealth, the powers and immunities of corporations, or bodies politic in law.\u201d The preamble recites the reasons to be, the saving time to the legislature in enacting laws to incorporate private associations, and the convenience of individuals desirous of incorporation \u2014 and the law provides: \u201cThat when any number of persons, citizens of the state, are associated, or mean to associate for any literary, charitable or religious purpose, they are empowered to obtain a charter of incorporation, subject only to the following conditions. To state in writing the objects, articles and conditions of their association, and if the attorney general and the supreme court shall certify their opinion that they are lawful, the governor shall order it to be enrolled; and the persons associated become an incorporated body in law and in fact; to have continuance by their corporate name and title. They are authorized to execute the usual corporate powers, and to make bylaws and ordinances, provided they are not repugnant to the constitution and Jaws of the United States, of this state, or to the instrument on which the corporation was established. The corporation and their successors shall be able and capable in law, according to the terms and conditions of the instrument on which they were established, to take and hold lands, money, goods and chattels given them, according to the articles and by-laws, or the will of the donor, provided the clear income does not exceed five hundred pounds yearly.\u201d \u201c And, whereas, bequests and legacies may be made to public institutions of which they may not derive the benefit intended, from a want of information,\u201d it is directed, that \u201cwhen a will is brought to the register\u2019s office, to be recorded, which shall contain a bequest or legacy to a public incorporate body, he shall give them notice within six months, of the nature and amount of the legacy, and the name of the executor.\u201d 3 Dall. 40, 43.\nThe law of 1818 enacts, that where any lands are holden in trust for any religious society, or for any number of persons for the purpose of public worship or schools, or to be used as a burying-ground, or for charitable purposes; or where any estate of a personal nature,-is or may be vested in any person or persons, to be applied by them to any religious, literary or charitable use or uses, and the trustee or trustees neglect or abuse such trust or trusts, the supreme court, or court of common pleas, on complaint made, may call on the trustees to answer; and if, on hearing, the court are satisfied that the trust has been neglected or abused, may and shall remove the trustees, and appoint others in their place, who shall be vested with the rights and powers of the former trustees, and give such security as is required, j 2. The court shall have the power and jurisdiction of compelling the trustees to account before the court or auditors. Purd. 167; 7 Smith 43-4.\nThis law was followed by the act of 1825, \u201cTo prevent the failure of trusts.\u201d The supreme court is authorized to grant relief in equity in all cases of trusts, so far as regards the appointment of trustees, either in consequence of the death, infancy, lunacy or other inability, or where a trustee renounces or refuses to act, or one or more dies, or becomes non compos, and a joint action is requisite, and to compel a conveyance of the legal estate, when the trust has expired. On the application of any person interested in the execution of the trust, the court may appoint a trustee, having regard to the objects of the trust as fully as a court of equity can do, and the rights of the former trustee shall vest in him; on the application of trustees, the court may remove them and appoint others. The act of 1828 confers the same powers on the courts of common pleas, district and circuit courts. Purd. 858-60.\nProm this summary of the legislation of Pennsylvania, it appears to' have partaken of the spirit of its successive constitutions, and to have been constantly progressive, in the completion and perfection of the great system of its founder, each succeeding law being more liberal in its principles, and more expanded in its provisions. The principles of the charter of Penn continued in force and protected all religious societies in the enjoyment of their rights of worship and property, in their houses of devotion, after the repeal of the act of 1712 by the council, and the passage of the act of 1730, as before.\nIn 1733-4, Governor Gordon informed the council that a house had been erected in Walnut street for the exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, in which mass was openly celebrated, contrary to the laws of England, particularly to the statute of 12 Will. III., which extended\u2019 to the colonies. The council were of a different opinion, and declared that the catholics were protected by the charter of privileges and the law concerning liberty of conscience; but they referred the subject to the governor, that he might consult his superiors at home. No other proceedings however took place. Gord. 216. \u2022This opinion of the council accords with the declaration of William Penn to the members of the assembly, in 1701, \u201c That he had justly given privileges the precedency of property as the bulwark to secure the other;\u201d 2 Clarkson\u2019s Life of Penn, 203: it was a rule of property, and the basis of the usage and common law of the state; the opinion of the council was the practical exposition of the charter, as understood and acknowledged, of which there cannot be a stronger case than the one that occurred. The 11 & 12 Will. III., ch. 4, prohibited the celebration of mass in any of the dominions of England, under a penalty of perpetual imprisonment. 4 Ruff. St. 41. If this statute included the colonies, it was repealed by the charter; if it did not, there was no law professing or attempting to interfere with it as a fundamental law of the colony.\nThe list of laws rejected by the king in council, shows the constant struggle between the policy of the colony and mother country; Hall and Sellers\u2019 L. 21, 57, 67, 99, 125, 193, 199, 276; Miller\u2019s L. 16, 74, 158; which ended only with the revolution. The usage continued, in despite of the efforts of the king and council to prevent it from having the sanction of a law, and the provisions of the constitution were as broad as the usage: its phraseology is adapted to the inconveniences which existed, and its provisions afford a remedy commensurate with the mischief arising from the want of a legal sanction to rights indispensable to the enjoyment of practical liberty of conscience, as a bulwark to property.\nIn the case of the Cedar Spring congregation, the trust did not depend on the enabling provisions of the statute, but on the custom of the province, as stated in Witman v. Lex; Methodist Church v. Remington; 6 Binn. 59, &c. The evidence of this custom appears in all the acts for granting charters, and in the law of 1791, in relation to the lots held by the quaker societies in Front street, and at the corner of Fourth and Arch streets. 3 Dall. L. 46-7. The proceeding before the council in 1734, is unequivocal evidence of the claim of right by the catholic societies, according to the usage under the charter of 1701; so that we have from the most authentic sources, full evidence of the existence of a custom and usage, expressly saved and preserved by the constitution of 1776, which operates not only prospectively, but refers by express terms to the former constitution of 1701, so as to make the usage of the same force from that time, as it would have had, if the state had been then independent of the mother country, as she was in 1776. Being saved by the supreme law, the custom had the same force as the law itself, and stood on the same basis as customs saved by Magna Charta, according to the rules of law before laid down.\nThe constitution, of 1776, then, puts the rights which could be enjoyed by the previous custom of the province, on the same footing as if they had been, defined in detail in the 45th section, and the present constitution makes them perpetual. If any additional sanction could be given to them by human authority, it will be found in the first amendment to the constitution of the United States. \u201c Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d This extends to the judicial as well as legislative departments of the government, and annuls all jurisdiction over the subject matter, past or future; 1 Cranch 174-9; 3 Dall. 382. If the rights of a religious or literary society are derived from a contract or grant, no state law can impair their obligation, and the supreme court have placed them under the same constitutional protection as those of individuals; 9 Cranch 45; 9 Wheat. 454; 8 Wheat. 480; 4 Wheat. 624.\nTo deny to bodies united without a charter, any rights of property which could be enjoyed by a corporate body, would be in direct opposition to both the constitutions of the state and union, and the custom of the province. \u201c Incorporations were almost unknown; yet to all sorts of pious and charitable associations, in every part of the province, valuable bequests were made by those who were ignorant of the niceties of expression necessary to accomplish the object at common law. Nothing was more frequent than bequests to unincorporated congregations, without the intervention of trustees; and even when there was a corporation, it frequently happened that the corporate designation was mistaken, or the trust vaguely defined. Notwithstanding which, the testator\u2019s bounty was uniformly applied to the object.\u201d Surely a usage of such early origin and extensive application, may claim the sanction of a law, resting, as it does on the basis of all our laws of domestic origin, the legislation of common consent. 17 S. & R. 91-2.\nThe same principle is adopted in all governments; a usage or custom is presumed to have had its origin iri a law once in existence, and lost in the lapse of time, the evidence whereof being by prescription, that supplies the place of the written law, which is taken to have been as broad as the usage. The law presumed from a custom, has the same force as one appearing on the rolls of Parliament \u2014 the only difference is in the mode of proof; and the rule that a custom shall not prevail against an act of parliament, unless it is saved and preserved by a statute; 3 Dow Parl. Cas. 112; Anstruther, 614; 1 Dow Parl. Cas. 322. The supreme law of England and the states of this union, which have no written constitutions of government, is proved only by legislative usage, which is the evidence of their constitution and supreme law; 3 Dall. 400; 2 Pet. 656-7; 6 Pet. 714-15. On whatever subject a known and recognised usage exists, it forms the law of the case, and controls all affirmative statutes, and the rules of the common law \u2014 as a general or local law, according-to its nature; 6 Pet. 715, and cases cited; the reason is ob-vious \u2014 it is founded on a law presumed from the prescription. This presumption is not, that such a law ever, in fact, existed, but \u201c it is adopted as a general principle, to take the place of individual or specific belief;\u201d 12 Ves. 265-6; 10 Johns. Rep. 380; 6 Wheat. 504.\nThough the party claiming by prescription produces his title, and it is worth nothing, the court will direct the jury to presume another grant subse-' quently; all shall be presumed to be done, which shall make the ancient appropriation good, and the right shall be presumed from the prescription, if it could have had a legal beginning; 12 Co. Rep. 5; Cowp. 109, 110; the same rule applies to the franchises of a corporation; 4 Mod. 55; 1 Saund. 345; 1 Roll. Abr. 512; \u201cfor whatever may commence by grant, is good by prescription.\u201d Where possession has been long held under a claim of right, to the exclusive enjoyment of the lands of the crown, a patent, charter, or grant of the king will be presumed; 1 Dow P. C. 322; the same rule is applied in this country, (14 Mass. 534,) though the possession was taken and held under a defective title; 4 Pet. 506, 507; 5 Pet. 439, 440. The principle has been applied in Pennsylvania to a religions society, which had been long in possession of a piece of ground, on which they had erected a church, used it for public worship, and occupied an adjoining piece for a.burial ground, and another piece for the free passage of 1he congregation, and the accommodation of horses and carriages, according to what the supreme court declared the common usage. This possession was held to be sufficient to enable the society \u201c to recover in ejectment, and sufficient for a presumption, that the commonwealth had granted the land to the predecessors of the plaintiffs, or made a promise of a grant which would establish a right of pre-emption;\u201d Mather v. The Ministers of the Trinity Church and others, 3 S. & R. 510, 511.\nEither presumption is sufficient for all the purposes of this case; the only difference between a grant and a pre-emption is, the payment of the purchase money, which must precede the formal consummation by patent; but when paid, the right to a patent, and the enjoyment of the estate against the commonwealth, is complete. We may now assume these principles to be settled, that usage and customs have the force of laws \u2014 that those which are saved and preserved by the constitution of this state, are its supreme law \u2014 and that rights declared in the constitution, or which have been, or could be enjoyed according to customs or usage, saved and preserved, neither depend on legislative discretion, nor can be impaired, much less forfeited, by legislative power. It follows, that no charter can be requisite to give a capacity already existing by usage, or asserted in the bill of rights or constitution, ora dispensation from a forfeiture, which no law was competent to enforce or prescribe. Hence, the course of the legislature has been, in granting special acts of incorporation to religious, literary and charitable societies, strictly in the spirit of the constitution, to superadd to their constitutional rights, the privileges, franchises and immunities of corporations, to confer the powers of corporate bodies, \u201c to further their objects and charitable designs,\u201d to put all religious societies on the same footing, as to the encouragement and protection afforded by the constitution; Bradf. L. 11,23,52,89; Law's of 1790, p. 285; by imparting to them such powers, as would enable them to manage their corporate concerns, and enjoy their corporate property by their own by-laws and officers, and to assert their rights in their corporate capacity; not to give the capacity to take property, nor to release it from the forfeiture of mortmain. Charters' were given to catholic societies, \u201cto enable them to manage the temporalities of the church, as fully as any other religious society could do;\u201d Laws of 1789, pp. 456, 532; 9 Cranch 49, 326-7. A lottery was granted for the benefit of the Hebrew congregation, in order to save their property from sale by exe cution, \u2014 the preamble contained this recital \u2014 \u201cAnd whereas, it is just and proper that all religious societies should be protected, so far as is consistent with the principles of the constitution;\u201d Laws of 1790, p. 310; 2 Dall. L. 817.\nIn most of the laws granting charters, there is a recital to this effect, \u201cthat it is just and right, agreeably to the true spirit of the constitution, that the prayer be granted;\u201d or, \u201cthat this house is disposed to exercise their powers for the encouragement of all pious and charitable uses;\u201d Bradf. L. 37, 223,407; Laws of 1789, pp. 189, 198, 225, 285. They are retrospective to the property held by the society, before the incorporation, in some cases by deeds in trust for their use, in others, to the society by their name of association only, of which there are more than thirty instances in Bradford\u2019s laws, which fully establish the fact of the universal usage throughout the state, for all religious societies to enjoy estates without actual incorporation.\nWhat expresses the sense of the legislature most unequivocally is, the law of 1789, which, after reciting the 45th section of the constitution, declared so much of the law of 1779, relating to the college and charitable school of Philadelphia, as was repugnant to the charter from the proprietor, to be void, on the ground, \u201cthat the charter gave them rights which were entitled to encouragement and protection in the free enjoyment and exercise thereof, in conformity to the will of the donor, in the same manner as it could have of right occupied and enjoyed the same under the former laws and constitution,\u201d and that the law was \u201crepugnant to justice, a violation of the constitution, and dangerous in its precedent to all incorporated bodies, and the rights and franchises thereof;\u201d 2 Dall. L. 650, 651.\nWhen such is the effect of the constitution, it certainly could not be the law of the state, that bodies united or incorporated, needed any other protection for their rights, privileges or estates. They could be submitted to no other test than usage; and though the legislature could not be coerced to grant an incorporation, they could not infringe any right which could be enjoyed under the constitution. They might refuse them the franchises necessary to transmit property by mere succession, and to govern the society by corporate officers and by-laws; but as all the individual members were capable in law of acquiring it, no power could take it from them.\nThe inhabitants of a town may take in succession by a grant to their singular heirs, a private person may build and endow a house for a school, an hospital, a church, or abiding houses for the poor, without incorporation; but he could not, by his own grant,give it the corporate franchise of succession; 10 Co. Rep. 26, 27; 2 Co. Inst. 202; 9 Cranch 329. The rule of the common law is recognised and well illustrated in the preamble to the 39 Eliz. ch. 5, for the erection of hospitals, &c., by private persons, \u2014 the reason for which is declared to be, \u201cunderstanding and finding that such good law has not taken such good effect as was intended, by reason that no person can erect or incorporate any hospital,\u201d &c., \u201cbut her majesty, or by her highness\u2019 special license, by letters patent in that behalf to be obtained.\u201d The act then authorized the creation of-incorporations by the deed of the founder enrolled in chancery, without any act of the crown, with full corporate powers and franchises, and to make any by-laws not repugnant to the laws of the kingdom. Keb. St. 921; 2 Ruff. St. 687, 688. This statute was evidently the pattern for the act of 1791, as appears by the title, the preamble, and the enacting ' clauses. Neither contain any restrictions on any unincorporated societies or bodies: their provisions are remedial, in order to facilitate the enjoyment of charitable donations, and the furtherance of charitable objects, by corporate franchises; to enable an individual to do what he could not do without a law; \u2014 to give a private deed the effect of a public grant, in order to complete the pious and charitable work by the charter of the donor or founder, without a special application to the crown or assembly; 10 Co. Rep. 25-34; 9 Cranch, 49. Both laws are founded or: an existing right to make the donation; and if the right of property had not been understood to have been fixed and settled, the legislature would n\u00e9ver have interfered to secure its enjoyment in perpetuity by succession, as a continuing corporate franchise with no other limitation to the power of making by-laws, than the laws of the land, the will of the donor or founder, and the articles of association; placing the incorporation on the authority of parliament, in England, and in this state making it a contract or legislati.ve grant, the obligation of which cannot be impaired by the state.\nAll the analogous legislation of England is bottomed on the right of private persons, singly or associated, to take and hold estates of inheritance by apt words of grant to themselves and their heirs, which is a common law right of all subjects who are under no legal incapacity. In this respect the law of both countries is the same; the only difference between them consists in two particulars: \u2014 1. In England, those persons who have devoted themselves to religion, withdrawn from .the world, and entered into holy orders, are not deemed in law to have any civil existence until they have acquired the capacity of natural persons by the removal of the disabilities arising from their profession and the restoration of their original right. In this state, there is no such disability; the bill of rights declares it to be the natural and inherent right of all men to acquire, possess and enjoy property, and the constitution protects all members of society in their persons and estates; no common law disability, therefore, can obstruct the vesting of a constitutional right, and as no law can take it away, no charter is necessary to confer it, or to restore what has not been relinquished or lost. 2. In England, there are statutory disabilities on corporations, whereby they are less favoured than individuals or bodies not incorporated; but, in this state, they are subject to no restraints, and in the constitution are placed on the same footing of protection as private persons or bodies united without a charter \u2014 there is of course no necessity of any law to repeal a statutory disability, or of a license by any subordinate authority, to perfect a right conferred by a supreme law. If an act of parliament had contained the same provisions as the constitution of this state, and the statute of 34 & 35 Hen. VIII. had contained no exception for coporations, there could have been no doubt that any religious society could have taken an estate in fee without a charter, and enjoyed it in mortmain without a license. There can be no clearer evidence of the common law right, than the enaction of statutes to take it away, nor is any rule better established, than that an exception of a particular case is an admission that the case would have been embraced in the law or constitution, if no exception had been made. 9 Wheat. 207; 12 Wheat. 436-8.\nThe application of this rule to the jurisprudence of this state will furnish a solution of all the difficulties which have attended the investigation of the law of charities, and lead to results which cannot he erroneous. The reason of the law is the law itself, and we have only to look to the reasons which call for an incorporation in England, for the want of an act of parliament removing the disabilities of religious persons, and to bear in mind that the effect of the constitution must necessarily be that here ecclesiastics or persons in holy orders have a capacity to purchase, which is denied to them by the policy of the common law. Hence arises the necessity of an incorporation by charter or prescription, to give them the capacity of natural persons, by removing the disability arising from their being professed men of religion, as monks,\u2019 fiiars and canons, who are deemed dead persons in law; but when one of them becomes a bishop, an abbot, &c., he is the head or sovereign of the house, having a secular capacity to purchase and hold land, through whom the monks or the convent become as natural persons, and remain so while there is a sovereign or head. A grant to an abbot and his monks, or to the abbot and convent, is good, and vests the title in perpetuity; if the grant is made while there is a vacancy in the head or sovereignty, the fee remains in abeyance, but vests whenever the vacancy is filled. Perk. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 51, 55; Litt. \u00a7\u00a7 443, 655; Co. Litt. 263, 346 b; 9 Cranch 47, 329 ; 2 Pet. 580. The reason why a grant to monks or to a convent, who have never had a head or sovereign by charter or prescription, is bad,, is, that when a man taketh lands or tenements by purchase he ought to be of ability to take the same when it falleth to him by purchase;\u201d Perk. \u00a7 505: monks have not this capacity, because they are all dead persons in law; but the abbot, who is the sovereign, &c., and this by reason of the sovereignty, for otherwise he should be but as one of the other monks of the convent; Litt. \u00a7 655; Co. Litt. 345 b.; and the grant cannot take effect, though a corporation was made afterwards; 2 Co. Rep. 51 b.; Hob. 33; 8 Vin. Abr. 56, H.; Perk. \u00a7 3-4; Co. Litt. 2 a., 3 a.\nThe reason of this rule shows that it is confined to grants to persons who have no personal capacity or civil existence; it cannot apply to natural persons,- who have a common law right, guarantied in this state, and declared inviolable, as to whom a charter could have no effect except to confer some corporate franchise which was not of right by law. There is no rule of the English law which requires a charter to enable a society or body of capable persons to take and hold property in fee by proper and apt words of inheritance; any opinion to the contrary must be founded on the misapplication of the foregoing rule, as is evident from the cases referred to by the counsel in the argument of the case in 4 Wheat. 1; and in not discriminating between the right of holding an estate of inheritance with and without proper words to convey it, and between the effect of a deed, which transmits from ancestor to heir, or a charter which passes it from predecessor to successor. A grant to the commonalty, parishioners, inhabitants or good men of a place, (Co. Litt. 3 a.,) the commoners of a waste, (Sheph. Touch. 236-7,) the people of the county of 0., or to associates, being a settlement of Friends at S., does not enable them to hold an inheritable estate without a charter; (Perk. \u00a7 510,) if they could take any estate or privilege it would be only for the lives of the then existing inhabitants, (2 Johns. Cas. 323; 9 Johns. Rep. 75,) as in case of a grant to a single person, omitting \u201cand his heirs.\u201d They are capable of taking the fee by proper words of grant to themselves and their heirs, or to another in trust for their use; (8 Johns. Rep. 388; Sheph. Touch. 337,) but some person or body politic, must be named who can take by force of the grant as a mayor and commonalty, (Perk. \u00a7 64,) or the church-wardens of such a church, (Perk. \u00a7 55.) in ancient time, (Co. Litt, 3 a.,) and now by custom. Croke Eliz. 145, 179. The parishioners, inhabitants or good men of Dale are capable to purchase goods by such name, (Co. Litt. 3 a.;) the only reason why they cannot purchase in fee \u2022'by that name is that they are not a permanent, (Hob. 86) continuing body having succession; any estate conveyed to them in fee, must descend to their singular heirs, unless they have by charter or prescription the franchise of a body politic, which is the only thing required to enable them to hold in perpetuity by succession.\nThese considerations lead to the object and effect of an incorporation in England, first, to give to ecclesiastical persons the same civil capacity to purchase as other natural persons have by right; and, secondly, to confer the franchise of succession. In this state, the first object is effected by the constitution, and the incorporation is necessary only for the second; the only difficulty then is to distinguish between the natural rights of all the members of the society which constitutes the state a body politic, and those which are conferred by charter or law on \u00e1 body of men who are the members of a society united for particular purposes. The common law requires no charter to enable a body of men in any place to purchase chattels or receive donations of money, a chattel interest, or an estate for the lives of the grantees, in land, by their name, as a body, without other words; if one is necessary, it can be only to give them some privilege, immunity or exemption from the rigour of the common law, so as to make them as a natural person capable of enjoying an estate in fee without words of inheritance.\nA corporation is a permanent thing, that may have succession, an assembly of many into one body, (Terms of Law, 123,) an artificial body constituted of several members, united by its franchises and liberties, which form its ligaments and are its frame and essence, (Lilly\u2019s Pr. Reg. 459,) which never dies, and exists only in its political capacity, (1'Bl. Com. 468-70,) which unites and knits them together as a natural person, (lb. 272;) or a person who is made by policy and fiction of law, a body politic, with the capacity of succession in perpetuity, but which exists in both a natural and political capacity; Wood. Inst. 109; 1 Bl. Com. 468-70. The corporation aggregate which never dies and can take only in one capacity, holds in perpetuity by a grant to itself without words of succession; but a corporation sole existing in both capacities, takes only for life, unless the word successors is added, so as to denote the intention to convey to him in his politic capacity of succession; Co. Litt. 8, 9, 94 a., 96 b., 250; Perk. \u00a7 240; Plowd. 496; Wood Inst. Ill; Terms of Law, 124; Croke Jac. 532. Succession is a corporate franchise, by which property passes from predecessor to successor, as it does from ancestor to heir, by inheritance; Terms of Law, 123; 4 Co. Rep. 65 a.; succession is not a word of inheritance; a grant to a private person and his succes sors, carries only a life estate; succession must be granted by a charter from the crown, or a law making the grantees a corporation, so that their rights devolve on their successors by virtue of the franchise.\nThe object and effect of the incorporation is to create the artificial person with the same capacity as the natural person; whenever it exists as a perpetual body, in the exercise of this franchise, its uninterrupted enjoyment is evidence of a charter presumed to be lost, and it is a corporation in fact and in law; Perk. \u00a7 34; Co. Litt. 132 b.; 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 300; 1 Saund. 345; 1 Mod. 55. The word successors is not in all cases indispensable to vest an interest by a grant or an obligation in the successor of a sole corporation; as where a grant is made to an abbot and his convent, to hold in frankalmoigne, the tenure imports succession, and as the celebration of divine service, and free alms are continuing objects, the estate is in perpetuity, as in case of a gift in frank marriage; Litt. \u00a7 133; Co. Litt. 93 b., 94 a.; S. P, 3 Pet. 146-7. So where, by a local custom, the right passes to the successor, though not named, as the chamberlains of London; Terms of Law, 124; 1 Lilly Pr. Reg. 383-4; 4 Co. Hep. G5 a.; Croke Eliz. 464, 682; Hob. 247; 5 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 17; so, of church-wardens who are a corporation by prescription throughout the kingdom, with capacity to take and hold money and chattels for the church, but not lands, yet they may hold lands by special custom in succession as a corporation; March, 67, pi. 104; Croke Eliz. 145, 179; Croke Jac. 532; Croke Car. 455; 9 Cranch 45, 53, 328; 17 S. & R. 92.\nNeither are any particular words necessary to create the corporation; a public grant of corporate privileges is, per se, an incorporation to give the capacity of enjoyment according to the grant; as to the inhabitants of a town, to haveguildam mercatoriam, which unites them by the franchise, and makes them as a natural person for the purpose; 10 Co. Rep. 30a.; 1 Roll. Abr. 513; 1 Bl. Com. 474. And as the only thing for which a charter is necessary is, to grant the franchise of succession, its actual enjoyment and exercise is, per se, evidence that it was by lawful and competent authority; 1 Bac. Abr. 500; 10 Co. Rep. 28 a.; 1 Bl. Com. 475-9; 1 Lili. Pr. Reg. 459. London itself is only a corporation by prescription; 5 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 17, H.\nIf then the religious, literary and charitable societies which have existed in this state had no other foundation for their rights of property, than the principles of the common law and long usage, they could not be disturbed for want of an actual incorporation by charter or law; and when we add to these rights, those expressly secured to them by the constitutions of the state and union, we cannot doubt that they are as inviolable as a charter could make them. To decide that one was necessary to enable a religious society to enjoy the sites and buildings for worship, for charity, for education and sepulture, and funds for the maintenance and support of poor, would be a declaration that the rights of conscience' and worship could be made dependent On the discretion of the legislature. And, if a charter could be withheld from any society, united for religious purposes, so as to impair their rights of property, then a preference could be given to modes of worship; there would be a virtual prohibition of the free exercise of religion, and the sect favoured by the legislature, would be, in substance, a religious establishment.\n\u25a0 Connecting with the whole course of the legislation of Pennsylvania, the well known fact which appears in the record in this cause, that the societies of Quakers have never been incorporated, it is not credible, that their right to hold their places of worship and charity, and to enjoy donations of land and money, is a mere shadow, without a charter in fact. In our opinion, they have had from 1701, and yet have, a charter more firm than any patent or law can create, the great charter of Penn, which was the basis of the usage and custom of the province, and by its incorporation into the supreme law of the state, is the rule and standard of right by which our judgment must be guided. The law of 1777 repeals all laws inconsistent with its provisions, whether those of the mother country or the colony; and declares that laws not inconsistent with it shall remain in force, as well as such statutes and common law in England as have been heretofore adopted. The laws of 1705 in relation to deeds and wills, which have no exception of corporations, the law of 1730-1, which actually amortises the sites of houses of worship and burial grounds, then in possession of religious societies, devoted or erected for the purposes of religion or charity, was also a direct license to all protestant religious societies to take, and hold in mortmain by future grants and gifts. The law of usage which, being saved by the constitution, became a supreme law, gave the same right to all societies united or incorporated for these purposes, whether protestant or not. As the custom of the province was in accordance with the rejected laws of 1710, in relation to the powers and duties of courts of equity, to the law of 1711, for the confirmation of public grants, and of 1712, in relation to religious societies, and the various acts concerning liberty of conscience and the privileges of freemen, and as this custom is the law of the state, according to which, lands have been held in mortmain from its first settlement, we are bound to give it the same effect as is given to the custom of London, by all the rules and principles of law in relation to the construction of statutes.\nWe must apply those which have been adopted on the 43 Eliz., as laid down by the supreme court, to the constitution and laws of the state, and construe them most favourably and benignly, for the promotion of all objects connected with the maintenance of religion, the advancement of learning, the. relief of the poor, and public utility; so that the rights, privileges, immunities and estates thus guarantied, shall be enjoyed unimpaired here, at least as far as they are in England, by this statute. No one can compare its provisions with the legislation of the state, and hesitate, for a moment, in saying, that they fall far short of the protection given by our own laws to donations for pious and charitable uses. If the 43 Eliz. has by universal consent been considered as 'pro tanto a repeal of the statutes of mortmain, of superstitious uses, and restraints on corporations by the statutes of wills, they cannot be in force in this state, unless we reverse the whole course of the law, in the exposition of statutes, by construing them liberally in favour of forfeitures, and strictly against charities, so as to abrogate common law rights by equity, and defeat the remedy provided by statutes for their protection.\nIt must be remembered, that these are mere statutes of policy in contravention of the common law. The old statutes of mortmain were passed to prevent the king and mesne lords from being deprived of their seignoral and feudal rights accruing by prerogative and tenure. The statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI. were aimed avowedly against the rights of the catholic religion. Its suppression being their great object, donations for its support were declared \u201c to be superstitious uses, malain se, and destructive to our constitution and government under the protestant religion; therefore the law prohibits them, but it is not so with charities, which have always been favoured.\u201d The true foundation of the statute of mortmain of 9 Geo. II. was, that enough of lands had got into the hands of corporations that were indissoluble; -and even now charities may be established in the lifetime of a person, but shall not be done in his last moments; 3 Atk. 148, by Lord Hardwick; The history of the times gives another reason for this statute: it was passed in the session of 1735-6, during a period of high excitement against the catholics, and when the church was deemed to be in such danger that a bill for the relief of the Quakers from severe disabilities was thrown out in the house of lords after passing the commons; 5 Hume 617-18; 3 Rapin 225-6.\nIt is not congenial to the policy of this state to incorporate such principles into its system, nor would it be creditable to the character of its legislation, to expound it unfavourably to those rights and institutions which were favoured, protected and spared by the laws of a king who spared little besides. If any statutes were suited to the policy of the state, they are the 43 Eliz., and the 7 & 8 Will. III. ch. 37, an act for the encouragement of charitable gifts and dispositions, which in favour of learning, charity and other good and public uses, authorized the king to grant licenses to any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, their heirs and successors, to purchase and alien land, in mortmain, in perpetuity or otherwise, without being subject to forfeiture; 3 Ruff. 636. It may well be presumed, that the emigrants from England brought with them these principles for adoption, and engrafted them into their system of religious toleration and charities; but that they ever adopted any law which created a forfeiture for an alienation of property to any religious, literary or charitable society or corporation, or prohibited donations for the uses of worship, according to the ritual of the catholic church, is utterly inconsistent with the established usage, and every law of the state or colony from the earliest to the present time.\nThe law must be settled beyond all doubt before we can fee] justified in deciding, that the rights of religious societies, and of charitable and literary institutions in Pennsylvania, are less firmly established than they were in the mother country.\nAs to the statutes of superstitious uses, it suffices to say, that where there can be no religious establishment, no restraint on the free exercise of religion, and no preference of modes of worship, the celebration of divine service according to the rites of any church or society worshipping the supreme Being, cannot be deemed unlawful or superstitious; nor can an actual incorporation or express license be necessary to give to any society or body of men, the capacity of enjoying any right in accordance with a custom or usage, incorporated into the constitution, in order to save a forfeiture, by an alienation in mortmain, where none is in a like case imposed by the law of England.\nThe revolution devolved on the state all the transcendent power of parliament, and the prerogative of the crown, (4 Wheat. 651,) and gave their acts the same force and effect; consequently, a grant, charter or law made by its authority is, by the principles of the common law, equally binding on the state, as a patent or act of parliament is on the king. The state can take no estate by forfeiture when the alienation is expressly authorized by its laws, and the enjoyment of the estate secured to the grantee by constitutional provisions, which except the subject matter from all the powers of government.\nJt would be a remarkable feature in the legislation of the state, if, while its successive constitutions have mado the rights of bodies united or incorporated its especial favourites, and its laws give the right of self-incorporation to all religious, literary and charitable associations, and so far depart from the jealous policy of the state against chancery jurisdiction, as to provide special remedies for the execution of trusts in their favour, both as to real and personal property, they should be still considered as reprobates, outlawed by the statutes of mortmain, and their estates forfeited by the very act of a conveyance to a corporation directly, or to trustees for their use. If any, the least respect is paid to the constitutions, they must be considered as placing corporations on the same footing at least, if not a better, than in England ; yet if the judicial dicta which we find in the cases are the law of the state, the statutes of mortmain are in full force, while those which have softened their rigour have not been adopted, and the supreme law of the state is a very nullity, incompetent to protect charities, even to the extent of the 43 Eliz. or the 7 & 8 Will. III. There is no escape from this conclusion, if we take these dicta as the settled law of the state. If the statutes of mortmain are a part of the jurisprudence of the state, they have been so from its first settlement; and as they have been in no way modified or altered, they must be taken to have been adopted to their full extent, so as to cover the mischief they were intended to remedy, by creating the forfeiture, and giving the state the right to seize the lands aliened, or the mesne landlord to enter, as the land may have been held under the one or the other; 7 S. & R. 320.\nAs the tenures of Pennsylvania are free and common socage, there were no seignoral rights accruing by tenure, which could be defeated by an alienation in mortmain, except in case of a person seised of lands, dying intestate, and without known kindred, when the land escheated to the immediate landlord of whom it was holden, or to the proprietary, if he held immediately from him; according to the colonial law of 1705, (1 Dall. App. 45, \u00a7 12,) which remained in force till 1787, when the escheat was declared to be to the state; 2 Dall. 553. The mesne landlord, then, was till that time, entitled to the benefit of the forfeiture, and the license of the king or proprietary was no dispensation without the consent of the party to whom it accrued; the king could renounce his own right, but not the right of a subject: before the statute of Will. III., it could be done only by the power of parliament; Vaugh. 333-43-56; Co. Litt. 99 a. By the law of England, the license of the king and mesne lords is not alone sufficient; there must be a writ of ad quod damnum} to ascertain what damage it would be to any other person, to alien in mortmain; E. N. B., Ad. Q. D. (222) 493, &c. It follows, that a patent, license or charter from the proprietary, under the colonial government, or from the president of the council, before 1787, would not have saved the forfeiture to the immediate landlord, without his consent, and the writ of ad quod damnum; for if the statutes were in force, either by adoption or as the general course of the law of England,\u201d or the common law, they remained in force till they were altered or repealed, as declared in the acts of 1718 and 1777, as fully as if they had been re-enacted; and a license can have no greater effect here than it had in England before the statute of 7 & 8 Will. III., which was passed in 1695, thirteen years after the charter to Penn. \u201c With respect to English statutes enacted since the settlement of Pennsylvania, it has been assumed as a principle, that they do not extend here, unless they have been recognised by our acts of assembly, or adopted by long-continued practice in courts of justice;\u201d 3 Binn. 597. As there is not a spark of evidence of such recognition or adoption, we have no legislative or judicial authority for saying that it is now in force; consequently, no license would save the forfeiture before 1787.\nThe supreme court has declared it to be a point conceded, that the 43 Eliz. has not been extended to this country. \u201c But we consider the principles which chancery has adopted in the application of its principles to particular cases, as obtaining here, not indeed by the force of the statute, but as part of our common law, and where the object is defined, and we are not restrained by the inadequacy of the instrument which we are compelled to employ; nearly, if not altogether, we give relief to that extent that chancery does in England;\u201d 17 S. & R. 91. Assuming this position of the court to be correct, the inevitable conclusion is, that we have not adopted the great operative principles, by which it has been held in courts of law, as well as in equity, to be a repeal of the statutes of mortmain, 'de donis coniitionalibus, and of the restriction on corporations by the statute of wills; 3 Atk. 150. This is the effect produced, which has given to that statute its importance: those statutes interposed barriers to the vesting and enjoyment of property for pious and charitable uses, which the 43 Eliz. removed, so that they became opened for the exercise of the equity powers of courts of chancery as completely as if no previous disability by statute had ever existed; and this is the reason why it has ever been considered in England as the Magna Charta of charities, that, being an enabling statute, it repealed all disabling ones.\nIf we assume that this leading feature, this vital spirit of the statute, has not been adopted here, we should be bound to consider the prohibitory statutes which it repealed, as in force here in all their rigour; if we follow the' report of the judges made in 1808, as explained and adopted by the declaration which they made in subsequent cases, in connexion with the opinion in Wilman v. Lex, above quoted, we must declare the law of mortmain to apply to all donations of land to corporations, for pious and charitable uses, without the benefits of the statutes of Eliz., or Will. III., to mitigate their severity or save the forfeiture. Strange as this result maybe, it is unavoidable, if the protection which these statutes throw around charities in England does not exist here, or has been taken away by the statute, common law or usage of the state. They operate equally on all societies, whether incorporated by prescription, by special act of assembly, or the charter of the proprietary; so that the enjoyment of their estates depends on legislative discretion, in granting a dispensation of the forfeiture, accruing by an alienation to bodies, and for purposes not only valid, but favoured, encouraged and protected in England, -without license, under the 43 Eliz., or by the license of the king under the 7 & 8 Will. III. This latter statute was passed shortly after the first settlement of this colony; its words show the policy of the times to be' favourable to all charitable institutions, and connected with the political history of England, its passage is a striking illustration, of the disposition of parliament to make them its peculiar favourites.\nOne of the great principles of the revolution of 1688, was a denial to the king of the power of dispensing with, or suspending of laws, or the execution thereof. It was the first item of abdication of the crown by James II., as set forth by the lords and commons in convention, that he had exercised it with, out consent of parliament; and a declaration that it was illegal, was the first and second items of the bill of rights, (3 Ruff. 440-1,) which was made a fundamental law of the kingdom. There could therefore be no stronger indication of the spirit of the times in favour of charities, than by authorizing the king to dispense with the statutes of mortmain in their favour, making it an exception to a great rule and principle of government; and we deem it incredible, that a less liberal spirit could have entered into the legislation of the colony: yet, if the statutes of mortmain have been adopted, there can be no power to dispense with their forfeiture, but by the legislature. The principle of the revolution of 1688 has been carried into all the American constitutions: no governor can exempt a corporation from the forfeiture of mortmain by his license or charter, with a clause of non obstante statute; and no act of assembly before or since the revolution has exempted charities from the effects of mortmain. There are, therefore, but two alternatives for us to adopt; the first, that the statutes of mortmain have been in force from the first settlement of the province, that the statutes which, in England, have mitigated their rigour, and made them in some measure conformable to our usage and condition, the laws and constitution, have not been adopted, and that there has never been any power to dispense with the forfeiture, unless in the party to whom it accrued. Or, that they never were introduced by our ancestors, as any part of their code. In the choice of these alternatives, we cannot hesitate \u2014 we cannot look at one item of legislation upon the subject, whether of supreme or subordinate authority, or into the ancient customs and unbroken usage of the state, without at once perceiving the total repugnance between the whole policy of the state, and the existence of British statutes, which would compel us to declare that every house of worship erected in the colony -from the time of William Penn, stands upon ground forfeited by a conveyance to a religious society or corporation. It was due to the weight of judicial authority which bore on these questions, to examine them through the details of the law of England, as well as of the state, before we would venture to dissent from it; it was due especially to the high legislative authority which has declared what in its view was the policy and law of the state, as to the disabilities of corporations. The thirty-fourth section of the judiciary act makes it our duty to make state laws the rule of our decision, unless they are repugnant to the constitution, laws or treaties of the United \u00a1states. The preamble to the act of 6th April last, contains a plain declaration, that \u201cno incorporation, though lawfully incorporated or constituted, can, in any case, purchase lands within this state, either in its corporate name, or names of any person or persons whomsoever, for its use, directly or indirectly, without incurring the forfeiture of said lands Yo this commonwealth, unless said purchase be sanctioned and authorized by an act of the legislature thereof; but every such corporation, its feoffee or feoffees, hold and retain the same, subject to be divested or dispossessed at any time by the commonwealth, according to due course of law; Pamph. 467-8. On the other hand, we have the supreme law of the state in two constitutions, declaring \u2014 one, that the declaration of rights is hereby declared to be a part of the constitution of the commonwealth, and ought never to be violated on any pretext whatever; the other, that every thing contained in the bill of rights is excepted from the general powers of government, and shall for ever remain inviolate: among these rights are enumerated those of \u201call religious societies, or bodies of men heretofore united or incorporated for the advancement of religion and learning, or for other pious and charitable purposes, which shall be encouraged and protected in the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities and estates,\u201d &c., in the constitution of 1776; and \u201cthe rights, privileges, immunities and estates of religious societies and corporate bodies,\u201d are, by that of 1790, declared to remain as if the constitution had not been altered, and the first article of the schedule expressly saves the rights of incorporations.\nWe have felt it our duty to consider the law of the state to be as thus declared, and we have been unable to bring our mind's to any other conclusion than that any English statute which impairs the right of any corporation to enjoy an estate for its own use, is entirely inconsistent with the usage and constitution of the state, and could never have been in force by adoption, without deranging the whole system of policy, built up by a uniform course of the common law and legislation of the state for a century and a half.\nIf, however, we have not succeeded to that extent, we apprehend there can be little doubt that these propositions may be considered as established : 1. That, construing the legislation of the state by the rules which have been applied to the 43 Eliz., the statutes which would prevent the effectuation of any objects declared lawful, and by any disposition made valid and confirmed by law, must be considered as repealed so far as they embrace these objects and dispositions. 2. That conveyances and devises of land for religious, charitable, literary and public purposes, must be taken to be, within the meaning of the act of the 6th April, 1833, a purchase \u201c'sanctioned and authorized by an act of the legislature.\u201d 3. The constitution is an act of the supreme legislature of the state, which authorizes all societies or bodies of men, united or incorporated, to hold and enjoy to themselves, and in their own names and right; and the acts of 1730, 1818 and 1825, are legislative sanctions of their right to hold and enjoy lands, money and chattels for all these purposes.\nWe should have rested satisfied with results so satisfactory to our minds as these, if they had not been in some respects at variance with the understanding of the supreme court of the state, as to the law of mortmain, and the decision of the court in the Baptist Association v. Hart. Opposed to such authority, it would have been our duty to have surrendered our own judgment, unless we had found it supported by the constitutions of the state, and the United States.\nBound to decide on the laws of a state, as the courts of a state do, we must look to that which is supreme, as the only rule of our decision, where its language is plain; in its application to this case, it cannot be mistaken, nor can we overlook the first amendment to the constitution of the United States, which, in our opinion, wholly prohibits the action of the legislative or judicial power of the union on the subject matter of a religious establishment, or any restraint on the free exercise of religion. We know of nothing which would so directly tend to infringe this prohibition as a law to declare that no religious society should be capable of enjoying land for the purposes of sepulture, worship or charity, without a license from the state; if the legislature can seize it as forfeited, they may impose the most effectual restraint on religious worship, by taking from the society the ground whereon, and the building in which they celebrate it; and no preference of modes of worship can be so repugnant to the rights of conscience and equality of religious right, as to license one society to do what they prohibit to another. With such rules for our guide, we could follow no other.\nThe objection to the devise of the eight acre lot is thus narrowed to the want of residence of some of the members of the yearly meeting in the state. This is founded on the act of 1730, which is confined to religious societies within the province. In the case of the Methodist Church v. Remington, the supreme court say, \u201cif the trust before them is to be sustained only by the enabling provisions of the law of 3730, it must fall: on the'other hand, it is fair to say, that, though it derives no support from the statute, it is not necessarily prohibited by it; for it is an undoubted rule of construction, that an affirmative statute such as this, does not take away the common law, and there was certainly no absolute prohibition of such a trust by. the common law, or any previous statute.\u201d The objection is therefore not sustained by this decision, still less by the opinion in the case of the Baptist Association v. Hart, where the court declared that a devise in Virginia to a charity in Pennsylvania would have been good if the plaintiffs had been capable of taking; (4 Wheat. 27-29,) and it is in direct opposition to the common law in relation to bequests of personal property for charitable purposes, to be expended in Ireland, (1 Br. Ch. 274,) Scotland, (1 Br. Ch. 571; Amb. 236; 14 Ves. Jr. 537; 16 Vez. Jr. 337,) or for the support of a bishop in America, (1 Br. Ch. 444,) all of which have been held to be good; 3 Pet. 500-1-2.\nThe yearly meeting of Philadelphia is a protestant religious society, which has existed from the settlement of the colony, with known and recognised capacity of taking and enjoying property according to the law and usage of the province and state, as well as the principles of the common law. They must be considered as a body politic or corporate by prescription, possessing and enjoying the franchise of succession, with the same rights of property as a natural person does by inheritance. We cannot impair the rights of the body united by their franchises, by inquiring into the separate capacity of its component members. They might be in part persons who could not hold for their separate use; but that would not change the character of the society, nor afFect their constitutional rights as a body united for the purposes of religion and charity, located within the state; and, as such, they would come within the equity, if not the words, of the law of 1730. Be that as it may, they can- B-ot be excluded from the protection o.f the constitution and usage, in the absence of any law requiring the residence of all its members within the state, \u25a0or arty rule of the common law, which imposes any disability upon the citizens of one state holding property in any other state, as its own citizens may do. The objection to the bequests of money to the quaker societies in Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, and to the citizens of Winchester, assumes a different shape. Their alleged incapacity arises from their being composed wholly of the residents of other states, which must be tested by the law of the domicil of the testatrix. There is none which denies to the citizens of other states any rights of property which can be enjoyed by the citizens of this state under its constitution and laws, which declare them inherent in all persons. The laws for the enforcing the execution of trusts extend to all \u201cpersonal property vested in any person or persons, to be applied by them to any religious, literary or charitable use or uses,\u201d and the cestui que trust, or other person interested in the execution of the trust may apply to the courts of the state to compel the trustees to account, or to prevent the failure of the trust.\n\u25a0 The constitution of the United States declares, that \u201cthe citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states;\u201d this instrument was adopted by the same power which established the constitutions of the several states, and is a part of the supreme law of each, as fully as if it was incorporated in its body. We must take it therefore as a grant by the people of the state in convention, to the citizens of all the other states of the Union, of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of this state; no law of the state has given it any construction which in any way restricts its operation, and it is not the duty of any federal court to so expound the constitution as to weaken the bond existing between the states which have established a \u201cgeneral government of the union,\u201d a federal government of these states, by restraining the grants of rights or powers within limits narrower than the tenor and purport of the words used, according to their common acceptation.\n\u201cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect, and therefore such a construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it.\u201d 1 Cranch, 174-6. This clause is copied from the fourth article of the old confederation, and is one of the most important in the whole instrument; it becomes senseless if it is not applied to the rights of property. The political rights of the citizens depend on the laws of the respective states, (Art. 1, $ 2, clause 1, Const. U. S.,) rights accruing by contract cannot be impaired in their obligation by state laws, (Art. 1, \u00a7 10,) and personal rights are protected by the 2d and 3d clauses of \u00a7 9, Ait. 1, of the constitution, and the 9th amendment; leaving no subject on which this clause can operate except property.\nThe words \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d relate to the rights of persons, place or property; a privilege is a peculiar right, a private law, conceded to particular persons or places, (7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 113, Privilege, A.) whereby a particular man, or a particular corporation is exempted from the rigour of the common law, (Cow. Inst., Tit. Privileges,) as converting aliens into denizens, whereby some very considerable privileges of natural bom subjects are conferred upon them, or erecting corporations, whereby a number of private per sons are united and knit together, and enjoy many liberties, powers and immunities, in their political capacity, which they were utterly incapable of in their natural. 1 Bl. Com. 272. Among the privileges of the citizens of every state, is that of exemption from the law of alienage, though not bom in the state; and every body of private persons united or incorporated have the franchise and immunity of enjoying estates in succession in this state; these are exemptions from the rigour of the common law, which the citizens of other states may enjoy in this, as fully as the citizens of this state can. We can therefore make no distinction between these bequests and those to societies located in the state; the disability of alienage cannot be applied to the citizens, societies or corporations of other states, and they may enjoy properly as it can be enjoyed of right by those which are within the state.\nThe next questions that arise on this will, are the uses for which the various dispositions are made. As the supreme court have declared it a settled point, that the 43 Eliz. is not in force, we must endeavour to ascertain from other sources, what uses are pious and charitable, as distinguished from those which are deemed superstitious or otherwise invalid. The general course of the law of England, as to the transmission of property, was declared, in the charter to Penn, to be the rule in the colonies, till altered or repealed, and the common law was recognised by the acts of 1718 and 1777 as in force, as well as such statutes as had been adopted. It is also a conceded principle, \u201c that the colonists take with them such laws of the mother country as are useful and suited to their condition.\u201d 1 Journ. of Cong. 27. It will be necessary, therefore, to trace the law of charities through the English statutes which preceded the 43 Eliz. as well as the common law, so as to determine what was its general course, how far it has been adopted in the written law of this stale, or has been the basis of its usage independently of the enabling or enacting provisions of the 43 Eliz. and 7 & 8 Will. III., assuming them not in force as adopted statutes.\nThe following statutes on the subject come strictly within the description of the supreme court of the United States, in 4 Wheat. 31; they embrace cases within the statutes of mortmain, and gifts to corporations, and are analogous to the 43 Eliz. in all their features; so that there can be no reason for not giving them the same effect and construction as has been given to that statute.\nThe following are uses declared to be pious and charitable, by a series of statutes commencing in 1285, and affirmative of the common law: \u2014 The statute 13 Edw. I., ch. 41, enumerates the maintenance of a chantry, lights in a church, divine service and alms. Keb. 49; 1 Ruff. 106; F. N. B. 465; 2 Co. Inst. 467. The statute 17 Edw. II., divine service, the defence of Christians and the church, liberal alms-giving, relief of the poor, hospitalities, and all other offices and services before due, by whatever name they are called.

The relief of the poor of every parish; 5 & 6 Edw. VI., ch. 2; Keb. 676; 2 Ruff. 639. The resuscitation of alms, prayer and example of good life in the realm; Keb. 730; 2 Ruff. 481. The relief of prisoners, 14 Eliz., ch. 5; Keb. 847; 2 Ruff. 606. The repair of churches, 13 Eliz., ch. 10; Keb. 839; 2 Ruff. 595. The maintenance and relief of the poor in houses of correction, impotent and maimed soldiers, 29 Eliz., ch. 6, \u00a7 7; Keb. 894; 2 Ruff. 656; 35 Eliz., ch. 1; Keb. 907; 2 Ruff. 672; and hurt and maimed soldiers and mariners, Keb. 911; 2 Ruff. 676. The maintenance of houses of correction, abiding houses, and stocks and stores therefor, 35 Eliz., ch. 7; Keb. 913; 2 Ruff. 678. The founding and erecting hospitals and houses of correction, for the relief and sustenance of poor, maimed, needy or impotent people, 13 Eliz., ch. 5; Keb. 921; 2 Ruff. 687; 2 Co. Inst. 120. Donations to hospitals, colleges and other places, founded, ordained, for the relief of poor, aged and impotent people, and maimed soldiers, 39 Eliz., ch. 6. Schools of learning; orphans, or such other good, lawful and charitable intents and purposes; reparation of high-ways and sea banks; the maintenance of free schools and poor scholars; orphans and fatherless children; and such like good and lawful charities; 4 Co. Inst. 166-7.\nTo which may be added the cases not enumerated or recognised by the words of the statutes, but which are within their equity, by adjudged cases. The erection of chapels of ease, as members of parochial churches; Hob. 123 \u2014 4> or cathedral churches; Swinb. 66. Gifts for the advancement of religion, learning, piety and public utility; 11 Co. Rep. 70 b. 73 b.; 10 Co. Rep. 26; 8 Co. Rep. 130 b.

Making a stock for poor labourers in husbandry, and poor apprentices; 1 Co. Rep. 26 a.; Keb. 1040; Ruff. 74; preamble to 7 Jac. I., ch. 3. Such things as concur in decency and order with the intent of the founder; Br. Duke, 155. The 43 Eliz., ch. 4, enumerates twenty-one cases as classed by Lord Coke, in 2 Co. Inst. 711, which were all comprehended in preceding statutes, or the cases above referred to, either in express or general terms.\nThis review exhibits a striking coincidence between the general course of the laws of England and Pennsylvania, in the designation by both of'what are deemed and recognised to be the uses and purposes of piety and charity, protected and encouraged during the most intolerant times.\nThe same coincidence will appear in tracing to their origin in the British' statutes, and decisions of their courts, the rules and principles upon which donations for such uses have been construed and governed, as well as the remedies provided for their enforcement. The statute 17 Edw. II., de terms iemplarium, established and ordained as law for ever, that lands which had' been given and enjoyed for pious and charitable uses, should not escheat to the king or mesne lords of whom they were holden, on the extinction of the order of Templars, by whom they were holden for such uses. That they should be given to other men of holy religion, to the end that they may be charitably disposed of to godly uses. \u201cSo always that the godly and worthy will of the givers be observed, performed and always religiously executed;\u2019 Keb. St. 86-7; 8 Co. Rep. 131 b.; 10 Co. Rep. 34 b.; Co. Inst. 431-2; 3 Co. Rep. 3 b.; 7 Co. Rep. 13 a. The 37 Hen. VIII., ch. 4, and 1 Edw. VI., ch. 14, directed and empowered the king to dispose to the good, virtuous and godly uses specified in those acts, such parts of the suppressed lands, or their rents and profits, as had before been given to such purposes and misapplied. Also to dispose, change and alter donations given for superstition, to pious and godly uses, or to direct it to be done by the commissioners. The commissioners were directed to inquire what property had been given by deed or will to poor persons intended to have continuance for ever out of the chantry lands, and to make such assignment thereof, that the money should be paid to them according to the conveyance or will of the donor, and that all charges bn those lands for charitable or pious uses, should be paid by the king\u2019s receiver ; Sect. 12, 13. The commissioners were directed to execute their commission favourably and beneficially towards such uses and purposes, and their acts so made were declared as valid as if done by an express act of parliament; Keb. St. 636-44. The proviso in the fifth section of 39 Eliz., ch. 5, prohibited the diversion of the funds of any hospital to any other purposes than those appointed, and declared that such construction should be put upon the act as should be most favourable to the maintenance of the poor, and repressing all evasions of the act; 2 Co. Inst. 721-2. The commissioners were directed to make such orders and decrees as the said good and charitable uses may be fully observed in most full, ample and liberal sort, which not being contrary to the orders, decrees and statutes of the donors or founders, shall stand good according to their tenor and purport; 39 Eliz., ch. 6; 4 Co. Inst. 167. The laws for confirming patents and grants from the crown, declared them to be good and available according to their tenor and effect, their words and purport, and to be expounded most beneficially for the patentee, without license, confirmation or toleration; any misnomer, misrecital or misdescription of the premises, or a corporation, or any lack of attornment, livery of seisin, or misnaming any person or body politic, to the contrary notwithstanding; 18 Eliz., ch. 2; 43 Eliz., ch. 1; Keb. St. 852, 935; 2 Ruff. St. 612, 702.\nThese statutes were evidently the models from which the colonial acts of 1705, for confirming deeds, wills, and sales under acts of assembly, and the law of 1711, confirming patents, were drawn: the rejected law of 1712, in relation to religious societies, contains a most admirable summary of the effect of the general course of the statutes of England, as they had been construed by courts of equity; and the powers conferred on the colonial courts by the acts of 1700 and 1710, shows the intention of the legislature, that they should be exercised to the same extent and in the same manner as they were by the high court of chancery in England. It is, indeed, impossible to compare the laws of the two countries on the subject of charities,- without being struck with the strong analogy between them; the substance of the statute and common law of England was adopted in the early colonial laws, entered into the custom of the province, and will be found condensed in a few words in the 45th section of the constitution of 1776, with this marked difference, that what the 43 Eliz. has done by implication and the construction given by courts, the constitution has done by a direct affirmative declaration of rights. What was left imperfect was finished by the law of 1777, by expressly restoring the common law, repealing all laws inconsistent witli the rights declared in the constitution, and declaring all colonial laws then in force and consistent with it to remain in force; this was going farther than the words of the 43 Eliz., which contained no repealing clause.\nThe law of 1791, giving the powers of self-incorporation to all religious, literary and charitable societies, was an improvement upon the pattern of the 39 Eliz., ch. 5; and the laws for the execution of trusts was an adoption of the whole course of chancery, in administering trusts for the use of charities; so that we may safely conclude that the English system of charities, as it was at the settlement of the colony, has become naturalized here, not only as to the principles of equity, applied to the 43 Eliz. but the substance and effect of the enabling provisions of all the statutes, including those of Eliz., by which the common law as to charities was restored in England, and brought here by the eolonists unincumbered with restrictions.\nThe course of the law of England providing remedies for the enforcement and suppressing the abuses of charities, are next to be considered. The statute, 13 Edw. I., ch. 41, gave the following remedies where the lands were ajiened; if the king is the founder, he shall seize and hold the lands, and the purchaser shall lose his money; if a private person is the founder, he or his heir shall have his writ to recover the same land in demesne; if the lands are not aliened, but the alms withdrawn for two years, he shall have ari action by writ of cessavit; Keb. St. 49 ; 1 Ruff. St. 106; Keb. St. 30-1; 1 Ruff 66; Litt. 5 136; Co. Litt. 95-6. By the 2 Hen. V., ch. 1, hospitals were placed under the correction and reformation of the ordinary, by the ecclesiastical law; Keb. 212; 1 Ruff. 486. When the king was founder, the chancellor was visiter; Co. Litt. 95 b. 95 a. By the 37 Hen. VIII., all lands held by hospitals, chapels, &c., which came within the purview of the laws for the suppressions of the church lands, were placed under the supervision of the court of augmentations, who decided .exclusively all cases concerning them, as well as charities charged upon them, where the king was concerned or could be prejudiced; but all controversies between subjects were to be decided by the courts of common law; Keb. 608-9; 2 Ruff. 371: all copy-hold lands, and all lands held by the license, assent, grant or confirmation of the king, were excepted from the operation of the law; 644-5. By the 39 Eliz., ch. 4, the chancellor was directed to appoint commissioners, to examine into the donations made for certain charitable uses, and correct their misemploy ment; Keb. 920; 2 Ruff. 687. The 39 Eliz., oh. 6, directed commissioners to be appointed, to inquire of land and goods given to any charitable uses, which had been misemployed, and to reform and correct their abuses. The party deeming himself aggrieved, may complain to the chancellor, who shall judge thereon according to equity; 4 Co. Inst. 167. This act was repealed by the 43 Eliz., eh. 9, but the proceedings under it were confirmed, (Keb. 648,) the adoption of the 43 Eliz., ch. 4, as a substitute for it, having made it inoperative. These statutes formed the law of charities in England before the 43 Eliz., and made a system which has received but little improvement, either by that or any subsequent statutes; the rules of their construction adopteti by all the courts of England, have ever been of the most liberal tendency, to establish charities and correct the abuse or diversion of the funds devoted to their support.\n. The course of the common law on charitable and pious donations is in accordance with the spirit of the statutes before recited, and the rules established for their construction. It is an admitted principle, that the personal property of decedents was disposable to pious uses, for the good of the soul of the deceased; the children and kindred had claims upon the trustees, but came in under the title of charity'; the distribution was made by the ordinary at his discretion, to charitable uses in particular, or for the good of the soul of the deceased, according to the circumstances of the estate; 2 Bl. Com. 494; 2 Forrest, 190; 4 Co. Inst. 336; 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 612, N. 13; Moore, 822, pi. lili; Yes. jr. 69. The executor held the surplus to account to pious uses; Carey, 28-29. A feme covert executrix, may give the goods of the testator for the good of his soul; Perk. \u00a7 7, cites 13 Edw. III. Any person who has power and capacity to make a grant or devise, may do it for pious and charitable uses; 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 612; Br. Duke, 132. A testator by will, directed lands which were devisable by custom, to be sold by his executor, and the money to be distributed for the good of his soul; the executor held the land for two years without a sale, which the court held to be a breach of the intention of the testator, and they construed the will so as to make a condition, as such appeared to be the intention, the heir entered for the breach and recovered; 38 Ass. pi. 3; Lib. Ass. 221; Plowd. 345, 523. The king gives land to the good men of D. which was no corporation before, rendering a certain rent, and the residue to repair a bridge, the king released the rent, which being the cause of their corporation, would seem to have determined it, yet for the preservation of the charitable use, they shall continue a Corporation for that purpose only; Duke on Charitable Uses, by Bridgman, 134, cites 40 Ass. 26; a gift to a parish for a charitable use by deed, is void, but a devise by will is good, and the church-wardens and overseers shall take in succession. Ibid. Land was devised to the church of St. Andrew in Holborn, which was not capable of taking and holding in mortmain, but the court on an ex gravi querela brought by the parson to execute the devise (F. N. B. 441, L.) awarded it to him, considering it to be the intent of the will, that the parson should have it, and not the church, and construed the words so as to preserve the intent, and not to destroyit; decided 21 Rich. II.; Perk. \u00a7 509; Plowd. 523; acc., 17 S. & R. 92; 9 Cranch, 43, 328; 1 Atk. 437; 3 Pet. 119, 146-7.\nA declaration by will, that a<feoffee shall stand seized to the use of C., is a good devise of the land by intention, it being that C. should have the land. Dyer, 323, pi. 29; 1 Leo. 313; 15 Eliz. A gift of chattels to parishioners who are no corporation is good, and the church-wardens shall take in succession, for the gift is to the use of the church. 37 Hen. VI. 30; 9 Cranch, 328; 17 S. & R. 92; S. P., 1 Penn. Rep. 49-51. Courts will labour to support the act of the party, by the art or act of the law. Hob. 123-5; S. P., 3 Pet. 119. In 4 & 5 Ph. & M., 'a devise was made of lands to Trinity College and their successors for ever, for founding grammar schools for poor scholars, and held good by the equity of 1 & 2 Ph. & M., ch. 8, which suspended the statutes of mortmain for twenty years. Dyer, 255 b., pi. 7; 1 Co. Rep. 25-6, decided in 8 & 9 Eliz., C. B. Lands devised to employ the profits to find a priest to celebrate mass for the good of the soul of the testator, and other souls, as long as the laws of the land would suffer it; and if the laws prohibited it, then to the use of all the poorest people in six parishes, with power to the devisees to dispose of the profits at their pleasure to any of these purposes \u2014 the devise was held good, and not to be within any of the statutes. Anders. 43; Croke Car. 108; 2 Ch. Cas. 18 a., decided 3 Eliz. So of a devise to sustain poor men decayed by misfortune or under the visitation of God. Moore, 129, pl. 277, decided 24 & 25 Eliz.; or to relieve such as were imprisoned for conscience sake. Bridg. Duke, 131, adj. 41 Eliz. A devise to an idiot for a charitable use, though inoperative in his life time, takes effect when the land comes to the hands of his heir. Bridg. Duke, 134. A gift to find a chaplain ad divina celebranda is not for a superstitious use, and, though not within the 43 Eliz., is good. Carey, 39; Bridg. Duke, 154, adj. 18 Jac. I. acc. So forfinding a bell for a church, a pulpit cushion and cloth \u2014 for the support of the poor, or building a session house \u2014 these are good acts of piety, charity and justice. Poph. 139. So where land was devised to divers persons and their heirs, in trust and confidence in them, out of the profits to erect a free school and to pay so much to the 'master yearly, and so much to the usher, and \u00a320 per annum to five poor men. Croke Eliz. 288, Martidale v. Martin, adj. 34 & 35 Eliz., K. B. The same will contained another devise in trust \u2014 that a preacher shall be found for ever to preach the word of God in the church of St. Miary, in Thetford, four times a year, at ten shillings a sermon \u2014 both clauses of the will were adjudged good, by the barons of the exchequer and the judges of the K. B., who, after \u201coften argument, agreed, that the 23 Heni VIII., ch. 10, was to be taken to extend only to superstitious uses, by the words of it, in the very body of the act, and at the beginning, as by the time it was made \u2014 for at this time they began to have respect to the ruin of the authority of the Pope and the dissolution of the abbeys, chauntries and the like.\u201d Poph. 6, 7, 8, Gibbons v. Maltyard and Martin, adj. 34 & 35 Eliz. So of a devise for a free school, and the support of a master thereof, and certain alms-men and alms-women for ever; the devise was held to be valid, though it did not take effect, owing to the breach of the condition on which it was made to depend. 1 Co. Rep. 22-25, Porter\u2019s Case, 34 & 35 Eliz., in Exchequer. In the case of the Mayor and Burgesses of Reading v. Lane, a devise was madeto the poor people maintained in the hospital of St. Leonard\u2019s, in Reading; the objection to the devise was, that the poor not being incor porated, were not capable of holding lands, but it was decreed, that as the plaintiffs were a corporation capable of holding lands in mortmain and governed the hospital, the land should be assured to them for the use declared in the will. Toth. 7; 42 Eliz. lib. A. fol. 706; Toth. 32; Bridg. Duke, 134 b. 361.\nCharities have always been favoured in the law, by excepting them, when fastened on lauds, from ordinary rules; where they are charged with services for the advancement of religion or justice, works of devotion, piety or charity, although the lord purchases parcel, yet the entire services remain. 6 Co. Rep. 2 a., 36 Eliz., in the court of Wards. As, to make a bridge or beacon, repair a highway, (6 Co. Rep. 1 b. 2 a.) to marry poor virgins, to find a preacher in a church, or the ornaments of a church, (6 Co. Rep. 2 a.,) or to bind a poor boy an apprentice, or to feed a poor man. Co. Litt. 149 a. The law was considered so well settled that Lord Coke in 34 & 35 Eliz., states unqualifiedly, that any man at this day may give lands in trust for any charitable use, to any person or persons and their heirs. 1 Co. Rep. 26 b.; Sheph. Abr. 1066. They are prohibited by no statute, and none were ever intended to overthrow works of charity, but to prohibit their abuse. Co. Litt. 342 a. The statutes of superstition did not extend to corporations, which were not both religious and ecclesiastical; (2 Co. Rep. 48-9,) gifts to lay hospitals remained valid\u2014 bishops, deans and chapters, parsons, vicars, abbots, church-wardens, &c., could hold lands notwithstanding the statutes of mortmain, as they were not dead persons in law, but had a capacity to grant or to hold land, to sue and be sued. 1 Bl. Com. 472-5; 2 Bl. Com. 109. Though they were religious persons, they were also secular, in which capacity, they were considered as natural persons, or bodies politic, and could purchase and hold lands, (Co. Litt. 94 a. b.; Perk. \u00a7 31, 35, 55, 51,) before the statutes of mortmain, and can now hold them in all cases where other corporations can. The capacity existed at common law, and was not taken away by the statutes of mortmain, where the uses and purposes were declared good by the statutes providing a remedy, or correcting abuses, which in the language of the supreme court, removed all obstructions and disabilities which in any way prevented the donation from taking effect, and restored them to their common law capacity. 4 Wheat. 31.\nCharities were thus left free for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the respective courts, who in all cases gave effect to the disposition of a testator, whenever his intention was expressed, or could be collected from the will, notwithstanding any defect in form, or the want of naming or designating an object to take; they would give it locality, and application, to those persons or bodies who were capable, if they could by any reasonable intendment.be brought within the devise. As, in the church of Holborn case, they shifted the devise from the church to the parson, because the church could not hold in mortmain, but as the endowment of a vicar or parson was good by the 15 Rich. II., and divine service by the 13 Edw. I., and by 17 Edw. II., it was awarded to him, and he held an inheritance in right of the church as a capable person, the church in effect holding for his use; so, in the Reading case, they shifted the devise from the poor of the hospital, to the corporation which governed it.\nThe law looks to the substance of the gift, and, in favour of religion, vests it in the party capable of taking it, (9 Cranch, 329,) but without the right to alien it. Wing. Max. 341, pi. 26. This consists in the enjoyment of the thing given according to the intent of the donor. Courts of common law and equity, were astute in devising means of giving it application and effect; whenever the instrument would pass the legal estate, either to the trustee or cestui que trust or use, they supported the charity; the mode of establishment, or the distribution, was a circumstance in which they would relieve, according to their respective powers, against any defects in the disposition by will or deed. Their action on charities was not, by any authority assumed from the necessity of the case, but the positive directions of the statutes, to execute and religiously observe the will of the donor, in the most ample and liberal sort, notwithstanding any defects or failures therein; the same rules were prescribed to the special tribunals and courts under whose governance charities were placed, and were applied as liberally in favour of a subject against the king, as between private persons. A donation to a charity, therefore, could only fail for want of a capable object, where there was neither a devisee to use, nor in trust, nor a cestui que use, capable of holding; they took effect whenever a trust was created and vested in any body or person who was named, described or could be brought within the scope of the will, and was capable-of holding either as cestui que trust or trustee.\nThe cases in which these principles were established, were decided before the 43 Eliz., on prior statutes, or the rules of the common law; they have been approved and acted on by the supreme court of this state, in 17 S. & R. 91; 1 Penn, 51; and by the supreme court of the United States, in 9 Cranch, 43, 53, 328; 9 Wheat. 455-64; 2 Pet. 582; 3 Pet. 119; 6 Pet. 437; and the practical rules of construing the statutes of charities as laid down in 4 Wheat. 31, are those which are to be found in cases not affected by the 43 Eliz., as well as those within it.\nThe remedies for evasions of the statutes and the abuse or misemployment of charitable donations, were administered with the same liberality by courts of law before as after that statute; the equitable powers conferred on the courts which were to decide on claims for charitable uses out of the king\u2019s lands or revenues, eviuces the favourable disposition of the king and parliament in their favour. The benign principles of the common law were never displayed in brighter colours than in the course of the courts in the exposition of the statutes of Hen. VIII., and Edw. VI., for the suppression of superstitious uses and religious houses; if any want of liberality has appeared in later times to have entered into the jurisprudence of England on charities, it has arisen from overlooking the provisions, or disregarding the principles of their ancient statutes, which contain all that is valuable in the system, or adapted to the institutions of this country. The statutes of mortmain, of superstitious uses, and the restraints on corporations, are exceptions from the general course of the law of England; legal excrescences which were forced into it by the policy of the times, during the existence of tenures in chivalry, the persecution of the catholic church, and latterly, since the statute 9 Geo. II., by a spirit of hostility to charitable donations by will, all of which are utterly repugnant to the spirit which pervades the common, the statute and the constitutional law of this state. There is no case reported as adjudged by courts of common law against a gift to charity, where words of inheritance were used in a devise to private persons in trust, or for a use, or to any body or society, which had a head known to the law, as being capable of holding for any other use, by statute, charter or usage, local custom or prescription. Perk. \u00a7 510, refers to a case decided in 26 Edw. III., of a devise of a remainder to the brotherhood of Whiteacres in London, to find a chaplain to pray for the soul of the testator; the brotherhood was not incorporated or enabled to purchase, and the remainder was held void. Perkins thus introduces this case \u2014 \u201cBut the commonalty of a company which is not incorporated by the king\u2019s charter to purchase, &c., cannot take by devise;\u201d \u2014 he states the case and concludes \u2014 \u201cAnd know, that the chief and supreme officers of the fraternity, corporation or guild are taken in law for the best men,\u201d &c. These remarks lead to the ground of the decision. The devise was of a remainder, which could not vest without words of inheritance to private persons, or to a corporation by succession; in this case there being neither, the devise failed on the ground that the commonalty or brotherhood, having no politic capacity by means of a head or chief officer, could not hold an estate by succession, and no words of inheritance being used, the remainder in fee continued in the heirs of the devisor, according to the rules before laid down from Sheph. Touch. 235-7, &c. There was no franchise in the commonalty, from which a corporation could be presumed, as in the case from Bridg. Duke, 134, decided in 40 Edw. III.; the statute of Rich. II., authorizing the endowment of a vicar or priest, had not been passed, and by the words of the devise, there was no ground to infer the intention to be that any church or parish should take or hold it, by a parson, overseer or church-warden; so that there was no circumstance on which the court could lay hold to take the estate from the heir at law and give effect to the devisees as in the cases referred to in 9 Cranch, 328, &c. A learned judge considers this to have been a case which could have been aided by the royal prerogative exercised by the court of chancery, (3 Pet. 142,) but it appears to have been one where the king had no interest or claim by statute, prerogative or tenure; the devise not taking effect, the estate remained in the heir of the devisor. The charity was not extinct as in cases under the statute of Templars; it never existed, because there was no devisee in whom the remainder could vest; the king therefore could not make a new appointment by his sign manual, (7 Co. Rep. 36 a.,) nor could a court of chancery disturb the course of the common law, on any ground of equity; such a devise would not be aided in equity under the 43 Eliz., unless the brotherhood could be considered as a corporation by prescription, by some franchise or right to unite them. This case therefore cannot be considered as at all in opposition to those which have been referred to.\nSo far as the common law could be settled by the repeated solemn adjudications of the courts of Westminster Hall, we thus find it established from the time of Edw. III., without any clashing decision. It only remained to add the sanction of parliament to these principles of the law of charity by a declaratory act to make them irrevocable. That was done in the case of the Thetford school devise, which had been held valid in the two preceding cases, in 34 & 35 Eliz.; Croke Eliz. 288, and Poph. 6-8. This devise was made in 9 Eliz., when the annual value of the land was \u00ab\u00a335 per annum, it afterwards rose to \u00a3100; a private bill was exhibited in parliament, 7 Jac. I., for the erection of the school, &c., according to the will, on which two questions were moved: \u2014 1. Whether the preacher, school-master, usher and poor should have only the said certain sums appointed to them by the founder, or that the revenue and profit of the land should be employed to the increase of their stipend, &c. 2. If any surplusage remained how it should be employed. The case was referred to the judges, and it was resolved, that the whole profits and revenue should be employed to the increase of the stipends, and if any surplusage remained it should be expended for the maintenance of a greater number of poor, and nothing should be directed to the use of the devisees, executors or heirs, or any private \u00fase, it appearing to be the intention of the testator to employ the whole in works of piety, charity, the maintenance and increase thereof, and the bill was passed accordingly. This was in accordance with the rule established in the statute de templariwm,, quoted by Lord Coke at the end of the case; so always that the godly and worthy will of the donors, &e., (8 Co. Rep. 130 b., 131 b.,) which was not a new rule introduced into the law by the act passed for the Thetford school, but as declared by all the judges in the case of Sutton\u2019s Hospital, in 10 Jac. I., was declaratory and explanatory of the common law; 10 Co. Rep. 30 b., 34 a. The right to take and hold the land devised for charitable uses with their increased revenues and profits being thus definitely settled by both the legislative and judicial power of the kingdom it has never been questioned since the case of the Thetford school, on which the statute 43 Eliz. had no bearing, and is not even referred to in the report of the proceedings in parliament or the opinions of the judges on the law of the case, as previously settled, in Croke Eliz. 288; Poph. 6-8.\nThe spirit of equity which pervaded the law of charities, having been extended so as to bring within its protection not only the specific bequests of a testator, but the entire fund on which they were charged, it was not necessary for courts of equity to usurp any of the powers of a court of law, in order to effectuate a charitable donation, or to establish any rules or principles different from those on which the common law courts had acted with the sanction of parliament. Chancery had its appropriate jurisdiction over cases of fraud, accident and breach of trust, arising out of dispositions of property to purposes unconnected with charity; if the party had a right known to the law, but had no legal remedy, he could resort to the extraordinary powers of the court of chancery for relief, according to its usage and settled principles, which applied to charities as well as other subject matters of its cognizance. To have refused the same relief in the one case as the other, would have placed charities under the ban of the law of equity, though they were the favourites of the statute and common law: if there was any thing in the nature of charities, which would call for or justify the withholding equitable relief for matters not cognizable at law, without special authority by statute, it would have appeared in the course of the law for more than three hundred years before the 43 Eliz. Its history exhibits no feature of the kind; on the contrary, it exhibits the most convincing evidence, that it was peculiarly the duty of courts of equity to obey the injunctions.of the statutes, to execute the intention of the donors and founders of charities, and not to suffer their dona tions (o fail of effect, or to be abused when their intention could be ascertained.\nThe proceedings of courts of equity are very imperfectly reported prior to the restoration; some few cases are interspersed among the common law reports, but they are mostly referred to in the short notes of Carey and Tothill, which do not give the reasons of the court for their decisions; we are therefore left to infer the principles which governed them from their acts, thus briefly noted, and the elementary writers in or near the time, who have given the results in general terms. Enough, however, can be collected to show satisfactorily, that the general course of equity before the 43 Eliz. in all cases of charities, was according to rules and principles as well settled and defined as on any other subjects, and was the basis on which the law now stands on the construction of that statute.\nThe jurisdiction of chancery over trusts was never questioned by the most strenuous advocates of the common law; 2 Bacon Abr. 22; Harg. L. T. 431; Treat. Eq. 523; 2 D. O. D. 764. It was coeval with their existence, and its exercise was indispensable in cases where the feoffor, having parted with his whole estate, had no control over it at law; but being made in trust and on confidence, the powers of a court of equity were necessary to deal with the corrupt conscience of the feoffee who refused to execute the trust \u2014 the cases of its exercise from the time of Hen. VI. are numerous; 4 Co. Inst. 84; Gilb. Ch. 19, 259; BohunC. C. 6; 1 Hu. Ab. 400; Lilly Pr.Reg. 57-8; 1 Roll. Abr. 374; Mitf. PI. 120-1.\nThe equity and use of the land being to go according to conscience, the subprena for relief herein in this court is given accordingly. Sheph. Abr. 201, pi. 13, 199. Chancery would not only compel the performance of the trusts specified, but compel the feoffee to do any other acts for the benefit of the feoffor or cestui que use in a deed or obligation. Bro. Conscience, 5, 9, 27, fo. 162-3; Carey, 13, 20, cites cases from the time of Hen. VI. and Ed. IV. It also remedied grievances arising from acts done which were prohibited by statute, but for which there was no remedy by the common law, as waste in certain cases. Car. 26 ;\u2022 Moore, 554, pl. 748; Fonb. 32.\nAll cases of covin and fraud were cognizable in equity, from the earliest times. Toth. 62; Car. 20, 25-6; 4 Vin. Abr. 487; Bro.

It will prevent a contract from failing for want of a circumstance or ceremony, (Carey, 24-5,) as livery of seisin, attornment, surrender of a copy-hold, enrolment of a deed, a misrecital; (Toth. 62, 12 Eliz. 79, 38 Eliz.,) or a misnomer of a corporation; Toth. 131, 32 Eliz,; Car. 24, 44; Bohun C. C. 7; Max. in Eq. 57; Toth. 27.33 Eliz.; Sheph. Abr. 194-5; Hob. 124; Cro. Eliz. 106. Though an estate cannot be created by covenant by law, it shall be made good in chancery; Toth. 84, 40 Eliz. So of alease made to commence during the existence of a former one which would make it void at law. Toth. 127, 25 Eliz.; S. P., 128, 40 Eliz. So where an exception was intended to be made, but it was omitted by mistake, chancery supplied it. Toth. 131,37 Eliz. So where a devise was void at law, by misrecital of a grant and by reason of an attornment; (Toth. 79, 38 Eliz.,) or a copyhold surrendered at a court held out of the manor where the land lay; (25 Eliz., Toth. 45,) or a conveyance sought to be avoided for want of livery; (Toth. 42, 41 Eliz.,) chancery will relieve, though the defect would be fatal at law. Where courts of equity act upon instruments to take effect in the lifetime of the party who makes an agreement for a valuable consideration, they will make it as effectual for the purposes intended as the party had power to do; (Sugd. Pow. 361,) and in dispositions by will, they will help against all defects which the testator had power to remedy. 1 Mad. Ch. 47-9. The principle on which they act is, that where the parties interested intended to contract a perfect obligation, though by mistake or accident they omit the set form of words, so that there is no legal remedy, yet they are bound in natural justice to stand to their agreement, and' \u201cwhere there is substance, the law will apply the words to the intent, though they sound differently.\u201d (Tr. 14; 1 Fonb. 147; Plowd. 140-1,) the imperfect execution of the contract not affecting the equity raised by the agreement. 1 Fonb. 37, 40, 41. Equity, therefore, will supply any defects of circumstances in conveyances; (1 Fonb. 38,) where there is an intent to make a better assurance. Carey 44.\nIt has never been pretended that the course of equity on these subjects was regulated or in any way affected by the 43 Eliz.; it was founded on principles which were the origin and foundation of its jurisdiction, and became gradually developed according to the exigency of the times. There is no reason which would prevent their application to charities in all cases between subjects, before the 43 Eliz. in the same manner as after; nor is there to be found in any decision or authority, other than the late dicta denying it: so far as any traces of its jurisdiction over charities are to be found in the books, it seems to have been under the three heads of fraud, trust and accident, and exercised without any doubt of the power in all cases where either circumstance existed.\nIn Toth. 58, a case is reported as having been decided in 36 & 37 Hen. VIII. in which the court of chancery decreed lands to the mayor and burgesses of Gloucester, to whom they had been devised for the use of a school and other purposes. When a donor appointed lands or goods to be sold to maintain a charitable use, and did not appoint by whom the sale should be made, it was decreed to be made by persons named by the commissioners, and the money employed to maintain a charitable use according to the donor\u2019s intent. Toth. 30; Duke on Charitable Uses by Bridgman, 360, 41 Eliz. In Sir Francis Moore\u2019s reading on the 43 Eliz., various cases are referred to which show clearly that charities stood upon the same footing in equity before the statute as they have done since. If a man devise that the executors of his wife shall pay money to be lent to young tradesmen, it is void, because he cannot charge the executors of his wife; but assets belonging to the husband were decreed to be liable to the charitable use. Duke on Charitable Uses, by Bridgman, 136, 40 Eliz. Land \u00a1sold in confidence to perform a charitable use, which the bargainor declared by his will, the bargain was never enrolled, yet the lord chancellor decreed the heir should sell the land, to be disposed according to the use. This decree was made 24 Eliz., before the statute of charitable uses, and \u201cwas made upon ordinary judicial equity in chancery, and therefore it seems the commissioners upon this statute may decree as much in the like case.\u201d If a reversion be granted to a charitable use, the particular tenant shall be bound to attorn by the decree of the commissioners, and it was said there are precedents in chancery where the lord chancellor had decreed and compelled the tenant to attorn. Sir Thomas Bromly decreed and compelled the terre tenant to give seisin of a rent seek to the intent the party may bring an assize. Duke on Charitable Uses, by Bridgman, 163.\nFrom these cases, and the remarks of Sir Francis Moore, it seems that the course of the commissioners and the chancellor, under the statute, was taken from the previous rules of judicial equity, which were settled long before its adoption; it was penned by him by order of the house of commons, (Duke on Charitable Uses, by Bridgman, 122,) which gives great weight to any opinion expressed by him, and to cases which he adopts as law. He says, no use shall be taken by equity to be a charitable use, within the meaning of the statute, if it be not within the meaning and words of the statute; but the words may be construed by equity, as the repairs of churches extend to all convenient ornaments, and convenients for the administration of divine service. A gift of lands \u201c to maintain a chaplain or minister to celebrate divine service, is neither within the letter nor meaning of this statute, for it was of purpose omitted in the penning of the act, lest the gifts intended to be employed upon purposes grounded upon charity might, in change of times, contrary to the minds of the givers, be confiscated into the king\u2019s treasury; for religion being variable, according to the pleasure of succeeding princes, that which at one time is held for orthodox, may, at another, be accounted superstitious, and then such lands are confiscated, as appears by the statute of charities,\u201d 1 Edw. VI., ch. 14. The effect of this omission is not to make the devise void, but to except such cases from the jurisdiction conferred on the commissioners by the statute. It is the same as a proviso which declares that nothing in the act shall be construed to extend to colleges, &c., which is only to exempt them from being reformed by commission. Hob. 136. So a gift for the maintenance of a chaplain or priest for divine service, will be a charitable use, aud in the direction of chancery, though not within the power of the commissioners; 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. N. 10, p. 609, and cases cited. As the statute gives to the chancellor no judicial power, except by appeal from the decree of the commissioners, it follows, that wherever he exercises any jurisdiction over cases not within the statute, or excepted from the power of the commissioners, it is independent of the statute;.yet the uniform course of equity in such cases, has been to give relief by the same rules and principles as if the case had been included in its enumeration. The lord keeper and the judges decreed, that money given to maintain a preaching minister, was a charitable use, notwithstanding it is not warranted by the statute, and that the same should be paid by the executor to such maintenance. Pember v. Kington. Toth. 34, 15 Car. I.; Bridg. Duke, 381, Penstred v. Payer. Where an endowment was made for a vicar, but was void at law by reason of some defects arising from the ignorance of the donor, it was decreed good in chancery; \u201c For in cases of charitable uses, the charity is not to be set aside for want of every circumstance appointed by the donor, \u2014 if it should, a great many charities would fail.\u201d Nelson Rep. Ch. 40-41, 15 Car. I., Joyce v. Osburn. So, where by will a certain sum was charged upon land for a weekly sermon and lecture, it was objected, that the devise was void, \u201cbecause the case was not in the statute,\u201d because \u201cno person was named,\u201d \u2014 \u201c part of the land was held per autre vie, and not devisable,\u201d \u2014 and, \u201c as the sermons had been discontinued, therefore the annuity ought to cease];\u201d but the chancellor held them to be good. 2 Ch. Cas. 18-19; S. P., 32.\nThis principle has been followed up by various cases, in which devises' to chaplains, ministers, preachers, vicars, &c., have been held good, (1 Vin. Abr. 249; 2 Vern..105; 3 P. Wms. 344; Swinb. 71,) and chancery has decreed the execution of trusts in their favour, without any other authority than that on which they, through all time, acted on matters within their appropriate jurisdiction. 2 Fonb. 210. It was strongly illustrated in a case decided immediately after the statute. In 11 Hen. VI., land was given with intent to find a chaplain to celebrate divine service, until the feoffor should procure a foundation, but was not so employed; the commissioners under the 39 Eliz. decreed the lands to the use, \u2014 the chancellor reversed their decree, because the use was not inquirable by them under the statute, but by his chancery authority he did decree the land according to the original use. Bridg. Duke, 154; Carey 39; 3 Jac. I. A decree was made for the heir at law, against certain feoffees who had lands conveyed to them to maintain scholars who should use holy orders. Toth. 61-2, Crofts v. Crofts, 3 Jac.I.; though this cas\u00e9 is not within the statute.\nThe general principle adopted in chancery, that the performance of a charitable use is equally if not more favoured than the payment of debts, (Bridg. Duke,-138, from Moore\u2019s Reading on the Statute, referred to as laid down in 42 Eliz.,') shows the reason of these decisions to he founded in general rules, to carry the intention of the party into effect, for all lawful objects, especially favoured ones, as is forcibly expressed in a note in Tothill, of a case decided in 38 & 39 Eliz. \u201c The law of God speaks for him, equity and good conscience speak for him, and the law of the land speaketh not against him.\u201d Toth. 126. This is the basis of equity jurisdiction; and as there is no subject to which the rule would apply with more force than to charities, so it will be found, that it has been the uniform course of equity to support charitable donations in all cases where they were not prohibited by law;\u2014 the inquiry has been, not what uses were authorized, but only what forbidden. Courts of original jurisdiction have taken cognizance of cases excluded from the power of special tribunals, without any statutory authority, and have not considered charities to be excluded from the protection of the law of equity, because they were not made subject to the power of the commissioners under the 43 Eliz. It contains no provision which enlarges the jurisdiction of the chancellor, as a court of equity, or as acting in place of the king by his prerogative or personal jurisdiction; in the appointment of commissioners, he acts as a special officer, selected to perform the duty imposed by the statute; in sustaining appeals from the commissioners, he acts by the rules of equity and good oonsoienoe, and these are the only functions which he is to perform under the statute, Keb. 943-4; 2 Ruff. 708-9. It is wholly silent as to a proceeding by original bill, between private parties, or by information of the attorney general, where the king is in any waj' concerned, or wherp the chancellor can act only by the sign manual of the king. It enumerates only twenty-one charitable uses, as classed by Lord Coke, in 2 Inst. 710, and prescribes only one rule to the commissioners in making their decrees: \u201cSo as the lands and money may be duly and faithfully employed to and for such of the charitable uses and intents before rehearsed respectively, for which they were given, limited, assigned or appointed, by the donors and founders thereof;\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhich decrees not being contrary to the orders, statutes or decrees of the donors or founders, shall, by the authority of the present parliament, stand firm and good, according to the tenor and purport thereof, and shall be executed accordingly, until the same shall be undone or altered by the lord chancellor,\u201d &c. 2 Co. Inst. 710.\nThis is the substance of the recital and remedial part of this statute; and if the law of charity could be traced to no other source, the system must have remained not only very defective, but would have been extremely illiberal and contracted, if it had rested on the enacting or remedial provisions it contains, or its operation and effect had been confined to the enumerated cases. By recurring to the statutes heretofore noticed, and the decisions of courts of law and equity, before this statute, it will be found, that they comprehend forty-six specifications of pious and charitable uses, which were recognised as within the protection of the law, in which were embraced all that were enumerated in the 43 Eliz. The statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI., for the suppression of superstition, protected more cases of charity, and prescribed more liberal rules for their establishment and maintenance, than the 43 Eliz. The rules they prescribed to the commissioners, and the courts under which they were placed, are more definite and explicit in favour of charities, even where their establishment would prejudice the rights of the king, than this statute directs in cases between individuals.\nThe same remark applies to the statutes of the 39 Eliz., and if a detailed comparison was made, exhibiting -the system of charities by the general course of the law of England, as it stood before the 43 Eliz., and as it would-appear from that statute taken alone, no jurist would hesitate in preferring the former as the most perfect and liberal. The contrast would be striking indeed, if we expunge from the latter all which it adopts from former statutes and the common law; or if we take from the rules and principles which have governed its construction, as they are stated in the hooks to have been founded on its provisions, those which appear to have been finally settled and established previously; \u2014 this statute and the great,system which has been supposed to have been built upon it, would lose its importance in the view of the profession.\nThat branch of the personal or prerogative jurisdiction of the chancellor, which is exercised on the information of the attorney general, by appointing a charitable donation to new objects, on the extinction of those to which it was originally devoted, will be found to be derived from the fundamental law of charities, established by the statute of Templars, 17 Edw. II.\nThe altering and disposing to good and pious uses, donations originally made for purposes of superstition, is a provision of the 1 Edw. VI. The appointment of general and vague charities to definite objects, results from the general direction of the statutes, prior to the 43 Eliz., to make such appointments, so that the will of the giver shall in all things always be faithfully observed and religiously executed 3\u201d (17 Edw. II..) and that the decrees \" shall be most beneficial in favour of the charities specified ;\u201d (I Edw. VI.,) so that the said charitable uses may be observed in the most liberal and ample sort. 39 Eliz. General charities are embraced in the 37 Hen. VHI. as \"good, virtuous and charitable deeds;\u201d and in 1 & 2 Ph. & M., \u201cthe resuscitation of alms, prayer and example of good life;\u201d and in 39 Eliz., ch. 6, \u201c other good, lawful and charitable purposes and intents;\u201d \u2014 they were also under the superintendence of the king, as parens patriae. So that in all these cases, the 43 Eliz. has no direct or indirect.effect in giving any jurisdiction to the chancellor. The appropriation of the increased profits and revenues of land charged with a specific sum to charities, to the same objects as those specified; and the rule which prevents their going to the heir, or any other use than the charity, is founded on the statute of templars, and the common law, as declared in 8 Co. Rep. 131; 10 Co. Rep. 30.\nThe words \"given,\u201d \u201climited,\u201d \u201cappointed,\u201d \u201cassigned,\u201d were taken from the I Edw. VI. ch. 14, and 37 Hen. VIII. ch. 4, (2 Ch. Cas. 18,) these are the words on which the effect of the statute has been mainly founded, and courts have extended them very far; (P. C. 271,) but their meaning is the same in all the statutes. An assignment of the suppressed lands to charitable uses by commissioners, under the statute 1 Edw. VI., ch. 14, \u00a7 13, had the same effect as an act of parliament, and the final decree of the court of augmentations of the revenue, the court of wards, or exchequer, establishing a charity on the lands or revenues of the king, was conclusive on his rights, let them accrue from whatever source: it followed that such appointment, assignment or decree, by the authority of parliament, had all the effect of a charter, license, and non obstante statuio, or special incorporation.\nIndependent of any statutory jurisdiction, charities belonged to the king as parens patrios, and fell under the care of chancery by the same authority which they exercised over infants, idiots, lunatics and wards of the king, .before the erection of the other courts to whom the powers of the chancellor were transferred. 2 Vern. 342; 2 P. Wms. 103-18; 1 BI. 90-2; 2 BI. 328; Gilb. Eq. R. 172. The erection of new courts, or the authority conferred on commissioners to do what had before belonged to the chancellor, virtute offieii, or by sign manual, was therefore only a devolution of his powers on the other tribunals; not the creating of a new power not before in existence, nor was the effect of their acts any greater by their special authority than the decrees of the chancellor, in virtue of his inherent or prerogative jurisdiction.\nThe law on this subject was so well settled, that in the 43 Eliz. the attorney general, Coke, and the two chief justices, Popham, Sir Francis Moore, and Anderson, by command of Sir Thomas Egerton, keeper of the seal, reported the following resolutions, on divers points on the 39 Eliz., ch. 6, directing commissioners to redress frauds and breaches of trust of lands and goods given to charitable uses. If the commissioners decree a lease or feoffment to be void, it is void in interest and estate. If the chancellor decrees it good, it is again good interest, but they thought that the chancellor could make no decree, unless the decree of the commissioners was against equity. That the commissioners could decree the payment of mesne profits received and misemployed, as well as make orders for the future profits. That the word \u201c given,\u201d in the proviso excepting hospitals and towns corporate, extends to gifts after the statute, as well as to gifts before. That they could not by a decree, establish a corporation of church wardens, or others, to take for a charitable use, but they could decree land to a capable body politic, without danger of mortmain, whether the land was held in capite or not, because the king is bound by the statute in that point. That they could appoint lands to natural persons, and their heirs to hold in continuance for charitable uses. That they had power to reform abuses in such corporations as were out of towns corporate, to add land to them, or make orders for them which should have the same effect, as parliament, by private acts of incorporation for charitable uses, gave, as to all things in which the law does not prescribe any special cause or favour. Moore Rep. 559-60, pi. 762; Moore Abr. 158, pi. 727. There can be no danger or error in taking the resolution of these common law lawyers, as the settled rule by which charities were administered up to this time; there certainly is none in following the statutes which are yet in force, and the adjudications of courts which are recognised as law to this day, as the \u201c general course of the law of England.\u201d In thus divesting the 43 Eliz. of its borrowed words, uses and provisions, it will be found that there remains but one important office which it has performed by its exclusive operation in aid of donations to charities \u2014 that is, to remove the disability imposed on corporations by the statute of wills.\nIn other respects, it can be considered only as an item in the legislature of England, which, taken in connexion with the decisions of the courts, framed the general course of the law on the subject of charities, which had become well defined and systematized; so much so, that we find much less litigation on charities before the 43 Eliz., than immediately afterwards. This was the consequence of the repeal of the 39 Eliz., ch. 6, and the very limited enumeration of uses in the 43 Eliz., which compelled the courts virtually to re-enact it by construction. In addition to the preceding view of the- jurisdiction of chancery over charities, there is a general principle of the law of England peculiarly applicable to this subject.\nIt is provided by an old statute, that no man shall go from the king\u2019s courts without remedy for his right; (13 Edw. I., ch. 50; Keb. St. 52; 1 Ruff. St. 111-12,)and was declared as a rule of equity by the chancellor, in 4 Hen. VII., fo. 5; Bohun\u2019s Ch. Cas. 3; 2 Co. Inst. 405-8, 485; 12 Co. Rep. 114 b.; Hob. 63; 3 Bl. Com. 52; 2 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 340-68-70; 1 Ch. Rep. App. 20, 48. The whole \u00a1judicial power of the kingdom is vested in the different courts, (4 Co. Inst. 70-1,) and there can be no failure of justice by defects of courts, for when particular courts fail of justice, the general courts shall give remedy. 4 Co. Inst. 213; I Bae. Abr. 554-5; 12 Co. Rep. 114. They are supreme within their respective jurisdictions, and that of equity extends to all rights recognised by the law for which there is no legal remedy, the cognizance of which has not been transferred to some other court; 4 Co. Inst. 84. The jurisdiction of chancery, according to equity and good conscience, extends to all cases cognizable in equity, and the party objecting to its exercise must show that some other court of equity has cognizance of the case; 4 Co. Inst. 82; 1 Bac. Abr. 560; Mitf. PI. 183; Beame, 57, 91; 2 Tern. 483; 1 Vern. 59; 1 Ves. 204; Dick, 129.\nIts course is governed by usage, without any statutory restraint as to persons or the subject matter \u2014 except cases affecting the rights or prerogative of the crown, to which it is extended either by statutes or warrant from the king; but is not exercised in virtue of the equity powers of the court; (4 Co. Inst. 79, 82; Bohun\u2019s Ch. Cas. 56; Hob. 63; 2 Atk. 553; 3 Atk. 635,) or the 43 Eliz.; 2 Co. Inst. 552. In acting on cases between subjects, the jurisdiction exercised is that which is inherent in chancery as a court of equity, depending on its usage, and co-existent with its existence, by the same rules as are prescribed to the chancellor on an appeal from a decree of the commissioners under the 10th section of the 43 Eliz., which adopted its old principles.\nIt is the same jurisdiction which the constitution confers on the courts of the United States, by the words \u201ccases in equity,\u201d and which the laws of this state of 1825 and 1828 confer on the state courts in cases of trusts, \u201caccording to the powers and rules of a court of equity,\u201d which this court can exercise to the same extent as in England; subject only to the restriction of the 16th section'd the judiciary act, where there is a remedy at law; Baker v. Biddle, C. C., MSS.; 3 Pet. 446-7; 2 Pet. 525-6. It is therefore clear, that the extraordinary jurisdiction of chancery was always applicable to charities in England; whenever there was a right to hold property for a charitable use, there was a remedy in the appropriate court, according to their respective jurisdiction, to be administered by its ordinary rules and principles without the aid of any new statute. It is also clear, that the personal or prerogative jurisdiction of the chancellor existed before the erection of the court of Wards, (2 Atk. 553,) and that the court of chancery exercised its jurisdiction at large on cases of charitable uses before the statute, and that there may be a bill by information in that court founded on its general jurisdiction; 2 Ves. 327-9.\nThere is no case reported or referred to, wherein chancery has refused to sustain a bill or information for the establishment of a charity for the want of jurisdiction; there could be no failure of equitable relief in a proper case, either between a subject and the king, or subject and subject, for before the erection of the courts of augmentations and wards the chancellor was invested with all the powers which were given to those courts which were most ample for all purposes of charities.\nThe case of the Queen v. Porter, in 1 Co. Rep. 22, has been considered as opposed to this position, and the importance given to it by the supreme court of the United States, in 4 Wheat. 33-4, makes it necessary to bestow some attention upon it. The case is too familiar to the profession to be stated, but one historical fact is stated by the Lord Chancellor, in 3 Ves. Jr. 726, which fully accounts for the course of proceeding \u2014 the devisee \u201cinstead of performing the will made a long lease, and the mode taken to effectuate the charity was this \u2014 they found the heir at law, and he having entered, conveyed to the queen, by which means she had it in her power to establish the charity.\u201d The attorney general filed an information of intrusion in the Exchequer against Porter, who was in possession under the devisee, on which there was a judgment in favour of the queen, which is equivalent to a recovery of possession, as the defendant in such cases is subject to a fine which he can avoid only by making terms; it only remained for the queen to grant a charter to effectuate the charity, as she had the legal estate by deed from the heir, and possession of the land on which it was charged; and it was the most direct mode of doing it. In any other way the difficulty would have been 'great. There had been an adverse possession from the death of the testator, in 33 Hen. VIII., till the 34 Eliz., so that the heir could not have recovered possession by any other proceeding than a writ of right; if successful, he could establish the charity by his own deed, only in the grantees and their heirs, or in trustees for their use. To make a corporation, it would be necessary to apply to parliament, as in the case of the Thetford school, or to the queen for letters patent, for at this time there was no power in commissioners by any statute to establish charities on any lands except those in the king\u2019s hands under the government of special courts. If the heir had refused, the interference of chancery would have been necessary to give relief to the parties interested in the charity, if the difficulty of obtaining possession at law had been removed. By the special verdict, it appears that the testator had edified \u201cdivers meases, mansions and places convenient for a free-school,\u201d &e., (1 Co. Rep. 19 b.,) and the devise of the wharf and house was for \u201cthe maintenance of the premises in manner and form, as the said N. G. have kept and maintained the same, and as the same is now kept and maintained without any diminution in any wise.\u201d There was then a vested interest, a trust created, and cestui que trust in existence, and the charity was fastened on the land into whosesoever hands it came. It was binding on the heir who entered for the condition broken \u2014 .\u201che shall perform the use because he comes in upon confidence, and the condition was compulsory to perform the use.\u201d Moore on Charitable Uses; Duke on Charitable Uses, by Bridgman, 137-8, 159-61.\nIf the powerful reasoning of the judges in the case of Ingliss v. The Trustees, &c., 3 Pet. 119, 140, 145, 154, is applied to Porter\u2019s Case, it is apprehended that there could be little doubt that the devise would have been carried into effect in a court of law, if the cestui que use of the charity had been in possession of the wharf and house; as the court of exchequer held the devise to be valid in law, and as the donor had an undoubted power over the estate, every principle and rule of equity would have induced a court of equity to compel the heir at law to have carried his intention into effect, by the exercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction over .trusts. The queen by her purchase acquired only the right of the heir, she held it subject to the trust, and as the condition which created the trust appeared on the face of her title, the cestuis que trust could have had their remedy in the exchequer, by a bill or information in nature of a monstrans de droit, as fully as in the case of a charity charged upon the abbey lands by the 33 Hen. VIII. But no further proceeding was required after the adverse claim was removed; as the object was the establishment of the charity, no interference became necessary, as the power of the queen was competent to do every act in order to carry the devise into complete effect; by the mode adopted all circuity was avoided, and the object completely effected, as soon as the queen obtained possession by removing the intruder. Plowd. 561; Hard. 460; 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 83.\nThe presumption of the want of any equitable remedy to establish and protect the charity, which has been drawn from the lapse of time from the death of the devisor till the filing of the information, is not warranted by any thing which appears in the report of the case, and. it is not to he expected that the collateral circumstances attending it can now be traced with accuracy; the one referred to in 3 Ves. 726, is satisfactory, and appears in the whole course of the argument by the counsel of the queen, to have been the only object of her interference. But whatever ground there may have been for such presumption, arising from the particular circumstances of Porter\u2019s Case, without referring to the general course of the courts of law and equity, or of the special courts or tribunals instituted by statutes prior to its decision; there certainly is the most abundant evidence that there was in some court a competent power to effectuate all lawful charities according to the intent of the donor.\nThe statutes and adjudications referred to are conclusive to this point, and no presumption can be permitted to overthrow their authority, unless modern doubts shall be more respected than the ancient principles of the law which governed charities before the 43 Eliz., and which have continued to this day the rules by which courts of equity have proceeded in their administration in cases not within the words or equity of that statute, as well as those expressly excluded from its operations by provisos and exceptions, as to which there can be no pretence that the statute either gave any new, or enlarged any old jurisdiction.\nThere is a large class of cases expressly excepted from the jurisdiction of the commissioners by the 43 Eliz., by declaring \u201cthat this act, or any thing in it, shall not extend to any city, town corporate,\u201d or land in them, given to the uses specified, or to \u201ccolleges, hospitals or free-schools,\u201d who have special governors or visiters to govern them, to \u201c colleges in the universities of Westminster, Eton or Winchester.\u201d 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 616, N. 19.\nThe 39 Eliz., embraced all \u201ccolleges, hospitals, schools of learning and other places founded or ordained for charitable purposes,\u201d but it was repealed by the 43 Eliz., ch. 9; 4 Co. Inst. 167; 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 614. Yet, notwithstanding the repeal of this law, and the proviso in the 43 Eliz., ch. 4, chancery has since, as they had done before, exercised a jurisdiction over them, which continues to this day, without any statutory authority, resting on its ancient basis. 2 Fonb. 208. Though the 2 Hen. V. placed hospitals under the supervision of the ordinary, yet where the \u201c king or any of his progenitors were founders,\u201d the ordinary was not allowed to visit them; \u201cbut the chancellor of England is appointed by law to be their visiter.\u201d Co. Litt. 96 a. The king may have a prohibition to the ordinary that \u201che shall not visit them, because the chancellor ought to do it and no other,\u201d \u201cso shall a private founder, if the ordinary will visit or cite any of the poor to appear before him or remove them.\u201d F. N. B. 42, 93; Reg. Br. 40; 1 Lilly Pr. Reg. 379.\nThe remedy must, of course, be in the temporal courts; if a resort is had to those of equity powers, it must be by ordinary process of a bill at the suit of a subject against subject, or by information in case the king is party, according to its ancient usages and rules, that wherever property is holden by one in trust and confidence, chancery has jurisdiction to correct fraud, accident and breach of trust. This power is exercised over the governors and visiters of colleges, hospitals and corporations, whenever they are trustees. 3 Atk. 108, 164; 2 P. Wms. 325.\nThough the jurisdiction of the ordinary is expressly saved by the statute, chancery exercises the same powers over executors and administrators who hold money for charitable uses, as other trustees. It is the existence of a trust which is executory that gives jurisdiction to chancery, and not the existence of a charity recognised by a statute; a statute has a different office to perform, to remove disabilities or incapacities, imposed by statute or common law, so as to bring charities back to their original capacity, and place them within the cognizance of the appropriate courts, as if they had never been affected by any change introduced by statutes, which had embarrassed donations for uses of charity, piety and education. When that office is performed, and the case becomes disencumbered of statutory restraints, the powers of the courts are brought to act on them, as the highly favoured objects of the law; chancery especially will protect them to the extent of its judicial power as a court of equity; and, by the personal jurisdiction of the chancellor, (which he exercises in right of the crown by prerogative, under the sign manual of the king, as parens patrise,) do what the king in equity and conscience ought to do. This is done in cases of charities for purposes so undefined, as not to come within the statute, or general charities, with which the commissioners have nothing to do, but must be determined by the king in chancery, on an information by the attorney general.\nIn a leading case on this subject, the decree of the commissioners was reversed as to a general charity, but affirmed where the objects were defined with reasonable certainty, (2 Lev. 167,) so as to come within the statute. In these three classes of cases not embraced in the statute, therefore, viz. \u2014 1, where the objects are wholly vague; 2, cases excepted; 3, cases within the jurisdiction of the ordinary, as also cases provided for by the 17 Edw. II., or I Edw. VI., the jurisdiction of chancery is wholly independent of its provisions, and is exercised as if it had never passed; as is strikingly exemplified in the bases of hospitals placed under the power of the commissioners by the 39th, but excluded by the 43 Eliz.; there was no ground on which chancery could take their supervision as to the execution of trusts, but by its extraordinary or personal jurisdiction existing before the 43 Eliz. It has been supposed that the latter must have been derived from the statutes, from the circumstance of there being no reported cases of its exercise antecedently: if there is any weight in this supposition, it applies with the same force for sixty years afterwards, for there is no reported proceeding in chancery on charities where the king is a party till after the restoration of Charles II.; but this circumstance is satisfactorily accounted for, by referring to former statutes.\nAll the lands of the abbeys, monasteries, &c., which were suppressed by the statutes of Hen. VIII. and Edw. VI. were placed in the hands of the commissioners appointed by the king, under the order and governance of the court of augmentation of the king\u2019s revenue, which had also the exclusive cognizance of all claims for charities, charged on, or accruing from the suppressed lands, by which the king could be in any way prejudiced or affected. Keb, St. 608 ; 4 Co. Inst. 121; Gilb. Ex. 159; 2 Ruff. St. 226. On the abolition of this court, its powers devolved on the exchequer, without any act of parliament, (Dyer, 216 a. pi. 55; Skin. 612; 1 Bac. Abr. 597,) which had the control of the king\u2019s lands and revenues, (4 Co. Inst. 194,) before the erection of the court of augmentation, in 27 Hen. VIH., ch. 27; 4 Co. Inst. 121-2.\n\u25a0 The king\u2019s demesne and purchased lands, with those which accrued by forfeiture and escheat, together with all matters affecting them, were under the supervision of the exchequer, which was a court of original jurisdiction, both in law and equity, by ancient statutes and usage, in all cases affecting these lands, or any claims upon them, or his revenues or profits issuing therefrom, in which the proceedings were by bill, information, monstrans de droit, petition of right, or the traverse of inquisitions, as the case may be. 3 Bl. Com. 44; 2 Co. Inst. 23, 553; 4 Co. Inst. 108; 1 Bac. Abr. 597; Hob. 63; Hard. 50; 2 Lev. 34; Dyer, 303; 3 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 312-\nThe court of wards and liveries was erected by the 32 Hen. VIII., ch. 46; it was a court of record and equity, in which the proceeding on the part of the king was by information in the name of the attorney general, and on the part of a subject, by the usual mode of proceeding appropriate to the jurisdiction of the court, which extended to all wardships of the king by statute, tenure or prerogative, in any lands or their issues and profits, as well as the estates of idiots and natural fools, and charities charged on the lands of his wards or tenants, which were in his wardship. 4 Co. Inst. 188, 202; Bohun Ch. C. 468; Hob. 136. The jurisdiction of the exchequer was taken away from all cases cognizable by the court of wards and liveries, (4 Co. Inst. 189,) and the statute 33 Hen. VIII., ch. 39, declared the jurisdiction of all these courts to be exclusive over the subject matter within their respective cognizance. Keb. St. 555; 2 Ruff. St. 324. The courts of augmentation, and surveyors of the king\u2019s revenues \u2014 of exchequer, and wards and liveries, had all the powers of a court of equity, in the exercise of which they proceeded by information, petition, traverse of inquisition, or English bill, and decreed for or against the king, according to the equity and conscience of the case as between subject and subject. 7 Co. Rep. 19 b.; Hardr. 27, 176, 230, 502; 4 Co. Inst. 19; Hob. 136.\nA reference to matters placed under the supervision of. these courts, will show conclusively, that during their existence the chancellor could in no capacity act upon charities in any case to which the king was a party in interest, or where he came into court by the attorney general; if a charity was charged upon his lands, or those he held in ward, its order and governance belonged to some of these courts, exclusively, and, as pavers patrix, all lands so given to charities as to require his interposition by sign manual, came directly within his wardship \u2014 as in the case of infants, idiots and lunatics. 2 P. Wms. 103-118. Hence all jurisdiction over charities which were too vague and general to vest according to the ordinary rules of equity \u2014 all charities charged upon lands which would have escheated to the king or mesne lords but for the provisions of the statute of templars \u2014 all charities charged on the suppressed lands for superstitious uses, which would have been seized by the king under the statutes of chauntries, but for the direction of the statute 1 Edvv. VI. \u2014 and all charities charged on lands belonging to the king\u2019s wards, was devolved on the court of wards and liveries.\nThe powers of this court were derived from the 32 & 33 Hen. VIII., and not from the 43 Eliz., which makes no mention of it. Yet we find from Griffith Flood\u2019s Case, (Hob. 136,) the authority of which is admitted, that that court decreed the establishment of a charity out of lands in wardship of the king, Flood being his tenant; the decree was made by the ordinary power of the court, and in a case not only not within the 43 Eliz., but expressly exempted by it, as one of the colleges of Oxford; the only effect of this statute was to remove the disability on corporations imposed by the statute of wills.\nWhile the power of this court continued, that of chancery over the subject was necessarily suspended, as the king could not proceed in it by his sign manual appointing charities, or the chancellor as his substitute; but as these charities were originally cognizable by the chancellor, and his jurisdiction ceased by being transferred to another cpurt, and not for any want of a competent power to effectuate all its objects, it would revert to it on its abolition, as was the case of the exchequer on the abolition of the court of augmentations. The court of wards was abolished with tenures in chivalry, first by Cromwell\u2019s parliament and afterwards by the 12 Car. II., (Keb. St. 1147; 3 Ruff. 192,) but the statute contained no provision for devolving its powers on .other courts. That portion of its jurisdiction which grew out of feudal tenures was of course extinct, that which was founded on the prerogative of the king in the supervision of charities, the care of lunatics, infants and idiotshaving been before the erection of the court of wards within the cognizance of the chancellor, returned to him as an original jurisdiction which had been merely suspended. Fonb. 207; 2 Vern. 342; 3 Bl. Com. 427-8; 2 Atk. 553; 3 Atk. 635; Mitf. Pl. 29.\nWhen the chancellor resumed this branch of his jurisdiction the proceedings were conducted as they had originally been, and as followed by the court of wards, according to the usual course of equity in all courts, by modes of proceeding appropriate to the case, and according to the principles which had been settled by long and uniform usage in the exercise of its powers; by an authority neither conferred nor enlarged by the 43 Eliz., nor assumed from the necessity of the case on the subject of charities, more than any others to which their unquestioned jurisdiction extended.\nThe personal or prerogative jurisdiction of the chancellor has been and continues to be the subject of great diversity of opinion in England and this country; but the radical difference between the two governments precludes the necessity of examining the question in this case.\nHere the executive of the state, or union, has no prerogative powers or authority; his sign manual can confer none on a court of chancery; the chancellor is not the keeper of his conscience, or the attorney general his representative in courts of law or equity; the rights and prerogative of the crown devolved on the several states by their declaration of independence, and the assumption of the powers of self-government. The general supervision of infants, idiots-, lunatics and charities, which thus devolved on them, can be exercised only by the authority of the legislature. A state cannot be made a party to a suit, without its consent expressed by a law or resolution, and no judicial proceeding or process by or against the attorney general, unless by the authority of the state, can prejudice its rights. He can have no control Over the fund which may belong to the state by escheat, on the extinction of all the objects for which it was created, and a failure of the heirs of the donor, or which comes to the prerogative wardship of the state over persons under legal disabilities; neither can be disposed of without an act of the legislature, who are the keepers of their own conscience, as fully in relation to their prerogative rights over the property of others, as the original public domain of the state.\nIt suffices for the purposes of this case, to have ascertained that the original inherent powers of chancery proceeding as a court of equity, according to equity and good conscience, can be exercised by this court to the full extent of the emergency of this case, independently of the 43 Eliz., either by its enactments, or any new rules or principles of the law of equity supposed to have been developed in its exposition.- Having given our views of the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts, in the case of Baker v. Biddle, we deem it unnecessary to review them, as we are fully satisfied of the correctness of the opinion there delivered. Its application to this case will be found to cover all the questions of jurisdiction which can arise.\nHaving disposed of the objections to the capacity of the meetings of Friends in this and other states, to take by deed or will for charitable purposes; the next subject of inquiry is as to the particular uses specified in the will \u2014 in the contested items which are, \u2014 No. 9. The eight acre lot is devised to the yearly meeting as a fund, the income of which is to be paid as an annual subscription into their stock \u2014 the application of which has been to the'printing and dissemination of books and writings that have been approved of by the society. 10. The bequest of the one thousand dollars to the five monthly meetings of women friends, is for the relief of the poor members thereof. These meetings have a common stock and treasurer, and it is applied to the support of the poor, and teaching poor girls trades. 11. This is a bequest of \u00a330, and interest from the year 1759, for the use of certain Indians. This sum appears to have been received by the father of the testatrix, from one Captain Newcastle, an Indian, for the use of his cousins, but a small part of it only was paid \u2014 the will directs this sum to be put into faithful hands, and was devised to the treasurer of the yearly meeting, for the relief and benefit of said Indians, for whose use it had been received by her father, and was evidently intended as the payment of a debt which she assumed by her will. 12. This was a legacy to the treasurer of the yearly meeting in Philadelphia, appointed to relieve the Indians, to the benefit of said Indians. The objects of the meeting are the civilization and improvement of the Indians of the Seneca and Tusearora tribes in New York, to supply them with articles of husbandry, oxen, and iron for mills. 17. Is a like bequest to the treasurer of the Baltimore yearly meeting, for the relief, benefit, and civilization of the Indians under their care, who live in the state of Ohio. No mone}\u2019- appears to have been expended for this object for some years past, but the committee are ready to carry them into effect, if they can he found. 18. This is to Friends composing the Baltimore yearly meeting, towards their \u201cstock,\u201d if they have one, if not, to one when it is their pleasure to establish it. It appears that this meeting had a stock at the death of testatrix, which was applied to the printing of books of a religious character, or on business of the society, the expenses of members attending the legislature, and the keeping of Friends\u2019 horses during the meeting. 19. This is a legacy to the yearly meeting at Mount Pleasant, in Ohio, for their stock, as in the preceding clause; there is no doubt they have a stock for the same purposes as other yearly' meetings. 20 & 21. Are legacies to Quaker meetings in Virginia for the relief of the poor thereof \u2014 towards the enlarging their meeting house, and the erection of a stone wall to enclose the lot on which it is built \u2014 both meetings have a stock and treasurer, and all yearly meetings have a stock. 22. Is a legacy to the citizens of Winchester, in Virginia, (which is an incorporated town.) for a fire engine and hose.\nIt would be a waste of time to examine into the validity of these uses; as objects of charity, benevolence or liberality, by the common or statute laws of England or Pennsylvania, they are good and valid by both; (4 Wheat. 45; 17 S. & R. 93,) even the statute 9 George II., does not apply to bequests of money or personalty, and the testator has specified purposes, charitable in their nature. 2 Rop. Leg. 105-6; 9 Ves. 406.\nThere appears no adjudication as to a bequest for a fire engine or hose, but there needs no argument to prove it as much an object of public utility, as a session house, (Poph. 139,) a town house; (7 Johns. Ch. 294,) or of charity, as cleansing streets, (23 Hen. VIII. ch. 10,) the repairing bridges, &c. (1 Edw. VI., 43 Eliz.,) or in case of taxes and assessments for the preservation of the property of the citizens. We should administer the law of charity in this state, with little regard to its principles, in excluding from its protection so laudable an object as this.\nAs to the bequests for the benefit of the Indians, there can be no doubt of their being proper objects of charitable donations, as coming within what Swinburne defines, \u201cpoor miserable persons,\u201d calling for the aid of the charitable and benevolent. Swinb. 66.\nThey have been so recognised by the legislature of the slate in the laws of 1788, incorporating a society for their relief and improvement, as a pious and charitable purpose, (Laws of 1788, p. 40,) in this particular, both judges fully concur; though there is a difference of opinion on some matters connected with this bequest, which were much dwelt on in the argument on both sides, there is none as to their being proper objects of charity, and that the uses and purposes to which the donations of the Quaker meetings are applied, are not only lawful, but in the highest degree deserving encouragement and protection. We have thus come to the conclusion, that the devise of the eight acre lot, and all the bequests in the will of Sarah Zane, which have been contested, are for pious and charitable uses and purposes, sanctioned bylaw.\nThe next inquiry is, are they so limited or appointed as to take effect for the objects intended. It must be observed, that except the 22d, the devises are all in trust for the objects of the charities; the only interest which any of the Quaker societies have in the bequests, is in aid of their contributions for their stock, which appears to be made up by assessments on the different subordinate meetings, but they take in no other way for any individual or collective use or benefit. The organization of these meetings is very regular, though none of them are incorporated. Their gradation is, \u2014 preparative, monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings \u2014 the latter having the control of all the subordinate ones, but all composed of the same members, and each meeting has its stock and treasurer, its application being directed, by the respective meeting, tOuagreed, approved and definite objects.\nThe testatrix was a member of the Philadelphia yearly meeting, and appears to have been connected, in a friendly manner with the meetings in Baltimore, Frederick county, in Virginia, where she died; and with the meeting of Mount Pleasant, a branch from the meeting of Maryland. We must therefore presume her to be familiar with the organization and discipline of ail the meetings, in all their details, as is evident from the provisions of the will. When she devotes part of her property to the stock of a particular meeting, it is most certainly her intention that-it shall be applied according to its discipline and usage, as well known and understood by herself. It follows that a contribution to such stock is of the same legal effect as if the objects of its application had been specified in the will, as in the case of a devise to an hospital, or any known institution; it is for the uses and purposes intended by the founder; so a devise by way of contribution to a fund devoted to specific objects, by a society who make it up, is in law a devise to such purposes and such only, it can be directed to no other by the trustees, or a court, though the object may not be clearly defined. 1 Vern. 43, 55; 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 99; 1 Aik. 356; 3 Merivale, 400.\nIt will be ascertained by usage, by the situation and circumstances of the testator, to discover what he meant, when the will gave no explanation; (2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 366, &c.; 3 P. Wms. 145,) as if he was a refugee, and devises generally to the poor, it shall be intended poor refugees of the same nation as himself, (Amb. 422; Duke on Charitable Uses, by Bridg. 494; 2 Rop. Leg. 147; S. P., Swinb. 316, 480;) or \u201cto the charity school,\u201d and there were two in the place, evidence was received to show that the testator was fond of the children in one of the schools, and declared he would leave them something at his death. 1 P. Wms. 674-5; S. P., 2 Dali. 70-2; 2 P. Wms. 141.\nThat a devise to the poor of any particular parish or church is good, has been often decided, (2 Rop. on Leg. 147-8; Toth. 30,) in this case, they are more definite, being to the poor of particular meetings, which, by reference, makes the designation complete, when we advert to the master\u2019s report, finding, that, at -the death of the testatrix, and before, there were meetings of the kind referred to, at each place designated by her in the will. Finch, 184, 245; 2 Lev. 167-8; 1 P. Wms. 425. The devises for the benefit of the Indians are likewise made specific by the evidence reported by the master, specifying the tribes of Indians, and the particular relief afforded by the committee during thirty years, by the expenditure of large sums of money, from time to time, under the direction of the meeting. The, intention to apply the bequests in the same manner, is too apparent for any court to entertain a doubt; if any could exist, or should hereafter arise, before a final decree, it is within our unquestioned powers to direct further evidence to ascertain and carry it into execution, if no other objections exist than the want of certainty in the will itself.\nIn 4 Wheat. 1, the devise was to \u201cThe Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia, annually,\u201d which \u201cI allow to be a perpetual fund for the education of youths of the baptist denomination, who shall appear promising, for the ministry, always giving a preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s family.\u201d The court declared the association to be described with sufficient accuracy, (p. 26,) and that such a legacy would be sustained in England, (p. 29;) sojhat there was no doubt of the validity of the devise, had the trustees been capable of taking for the objects intended.' In Wiiman v. Lex, the devise was \u201cTo St. Michael and Zion churches, to be laid out in bread for the poor of the Lutheran congregation, of which the testator was a member, and towards the education of young students of that congregation, under the direction of the vestrymen of the first named churches;\u201d and held good. 17 S. & R. .90-93. So of land appropriated by deed for public uses for the benefit of the inhabitants of a town, as a majority may order and direct. 6 S. & R. 211. So of a lot marked in the plan of a town, \u201c for the Lutheran church,\u201d for religious purposes. 2 Pet. 578. This was held good without further description of either the donees or uses, and to take effect when the church should be erected. The court took into consideration the use to which the lot had been appropriated from the time of the donation, which was for a meeting house and burying ground, and though the house had fallen down from decay, and no new one had been erected, they decreed it to be enjoyed according to the former use.\nA legacy to the town of New Rochelle, to erect a town-house to transact public business in, has been held a sufficient description of the charity. 7 Johns. Ch. 294; S. P., 1 Ch. Cas. 134. Courts of chancery act under an obligation to effectuate charitable donations by all the means in their power; (2 Freem. 261, 330; 3 Mer. Rep. 391,) more liberally than in private cases, without regarding the form or prayer of the bill. 1 Atk. 356; 1 Bro. Ch. Cas. 12; 2 Ves. Sen. 426; 1 Ves. Sen.418; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 198; 11 Ves. 365; 1 Ves. Sen. 468-75. It is enough that the testator expresses his general intention to establish a charity by making a donation to any object deemed charitable in law, or by using the word charity; (2 Ves. 399; 10 Ves. 535; 17 S. & R. 93; 4 Wheat. 45,) wherever a trust is created for charitable purposes, the mode by which it is to be effected, or the specific objects of its application are not material to its validity. 2 Rop. on Leg. 140, and cases cited; 3 Pet. 119; 1 Atk. 469; 3 Bro. Ch. Cas. 528; 7 Ves. 69, 86. They are put on the footing of dedications of property to public benefit, requiring no particular grantee or trustee capable of taking; though the object is not in esse at the time of the devise, (9 Cranch, 331-2; 2 Pet. 582-3; 6 Pet. 437,) the land remains charged with the charity in the hands of the heir till the object comes into existence; (2 Vent. 349; 3 Pet. 114-19; Bridg. Duke, 534;) so of money.in the hands of a trustee, the profits accumulate for the benefit of the fund. 3 Atk. 238.\nChancery will establish the charity on the application of any person who has any interest in the fund in his own right, or as an inhabitant, or a parish officer; (1 Ch. Cas. 134,) a member of a society having\" a common benefit from the donation, or a committee of a voluntary association without charter, though they could sustain no action at law; (2 Pet. 584-5,) \u201caccording to what may be collected to be the true meaning and intent of the donor, notwithstanding any failure or defect in the bequests, gifts or grants,\u201d as is correctly expressed in the rejected law of 1712. The courts of this country have gone pari passu with those of England, in aiding defective descriptions or designations of the places, objects or purposes of a charity, wherever they could, by the terms of the instrument, connected with extrinsic circumstances, give locality and application to the fund according to the intent of the donor as near as may be. 3 Pet. 117. Words will be construed in their most liberal and expanded meaning, in order to make out the substance of a charity capable of being aided on equitable principles, or the existence of a trust in the heir at law, devisee or executor, in the execution of which any individual or society has an interest which can be enjoyed by them, or held for their use, consistently with the terms of the donation by an equitable right; chancery will draw to it the legal interest, and give it full effect by \u00e1 plan to be drawn up under the direction of the court by a master, or the trustee.\nAn inscription on a tombstone has been held sufficient,(Bridg. Duke, 349-66,) or any direction by any writing, which can be deemed to be a limitation, disposition, assignment or an appointment, or gift of property to a charitable use \u2014 it will be enforced against parties and privies, except purchasers for valuable consideration of money or land, without notice of the trust \u2014 not regarding the form of the instrument. Moore, 888; Comyns, 250; Prec. Ch. 471; Sugd. Pow. 222-3. A direction by\"a nuncupative will, was held to be an appointment or limitation before the statute of wills. Dyer, 72, pi. 2; Swinb. 56, 68; Toth. 31.\nChancery acts whenever there is a trust, (3 Atk. 108; 2 P. Wms. 326,) which never fails for want of a trustee, (1 Penn. Rep. 51-2,) though he dies before the testatator, (2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 293; 1 Bro. Ch. Cas. 15; Ainb. 571; 3 Bro. Ch. Cas. 528,) refuses to act or abuses his trust, (2 Ch. Cas. 131; 7 Day\u2019s Com. Dig. 772,) chancery will remove him and appoint another, (Ch. Rep. 78-9; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 194,) or compel him to assign it. Finch, 269. These are the principles of equity which the supreme court, in 17 S. & R. 91-2, declare to be the common law of the state, which have been uniformly applied as far as the powers of the courts could be extended to the exercise of chancery jurisdiction; since the acts of 1818, 1825 and 1828, they can be applied to all trusts as fully as they can be in England, by the common law of equity, or the provisions or construction of any statute. They cover all the ground of equity which it is necessary to assume for the decision of this case; the defendant is a trustee for the purposes of the will; the bequests are to trustees either named or designated, who are capable of holding and distributing the funds intrusted to their management, the cestuis que trust are either sufficiently described or easily ascertained by extrinsic circumstances, and the uses for which the dispositions are made are not only valid, but favoured and protected by the law, which we can effectuate without the exercise of any personal or prerogative jurisdiction.\nWe shall direct the administrator ie bonis non, cum testamento annexo, to pay the respective bequests to the persons appointed to receive and distribute them. They will be considered as trustees, acting under the supervision of this court, as a court of chancery, with the same powers over trusts, as courts of equity in England, and the courts of this state, possess and exercise. Though our original cognizance of the case depends on the residence of the parties to the suit, yet when the fund is under our control, we can proceed in its final distribution among the different claimants in the same manner as if each was a party competent to become an original complainant, by original bill. Baker v. Biddle, MSS.\nWhen the fund shall be so ascertained, as to be capable of a final distribution, it will be directed to be applied exclusively to the objects designated in the will, as they existed at the time of her death, and shall continue till a final decree; if any shall then appear to have become extinct, the portion bequeathed to such object must fall into the residuary fund as a lapsed legacy. Its appointment to other purposes, or cestuis que trust, than those which can, by equitable construction, be brought within the intention of the will or donor, is an exercise of that branch of the jurisdiction of the chancellor of England, which has been conferred on this court by no law, and cannot be exercised, virtute officii, under our forms of government.\nAs the amount of the personal estate is evidently far short of the legacies made payable by the will, there must be a failure or abatement, unless the necessary amount can be raised out of the real estate not specifically devised. The testator having authorized the executor to sell the house in Chestnut street, and the Marlborough estate in Virginia, his powers devolve on the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., by the acts of assembly of this state; (3 Sm. Laws, 433-4; 6 ibid. 102,) and as he is a party before us, we can compel their execution, if the laws of Virginia recognise them as competent. But he has no power over any other portions of the real estate, nor are the heirs at law, or residuary devisees, parties to the suit; so that no decree which we could make would bind them, or the land situated in another state: our jurisdiction being both limited and local, we cannot compel parties who reside out of the state to appear on our process, and a sale of land in Virginia, under the authority of the court alone, would pass no title to the purchaser.\nIt is an acknowledged principle that the title and disposition of real property is exclusively subject to the laws of the country where it is situated, which can alone prescribe the mode by which a title can pass from one person to another; (7 Cranch, 116; 6Wheat. 579; 9 Wheat. 571; 10 Wheat. 202.) to which may be added the case of Bryant v. Hunter, to which we have been referred, as authorizing the sale of the Virginia lands, now asked to be directed. 2 Wheat. 32, &c. That was a suit originating in this court, affect ing land in Kentucky; but as only five-sixths of the land were represented by the parties to the suit, the court confined their decree of sale to the interest of the five parties before them; the sixth party in interest resided in Virginia, as to whom the supreme court declared, \u201c That the complainant must pursue his remedy, unless her representatives shall have the prudence voluntarily to join in the sales of any land that may be made under this decree.\u201d 4 Wheat. 34, 44, 45. We are therefore following all these decisions of the supreme court, in refusing to make any further order of sale of real estate, other than the two parts thereof embraced in the power given by the will.\nThe decisions of the supreme court of the state, and of the high court of errors, which bear on the residuary devise in this will, may derange some of the specific devises; if the legacies are a charge on the real estate specifically devised, they might affect not only the devise of the eight acre lot, given to the yearly meeting, but other devises to persons not parties to the suit, who must be heard before we can make any decree, touching such parts of the real estate. The application of the rule laid down in Tucker v. Hassenclever, 3 Yeates, 294-99 ; 2 Binn. 525-31; Nichols v. Postlethwaite, 2 Dall. 131; Whitman v. Norton, 6 Binn. 396; and Commonwealth v. Shelby, 13 S. & R. 348, would absorb much of the real estate to pay the legacies; but if they should be considered as a charge only on the residuary fund, according to Shaw v. M\u2018Cameron, 11 S. & R. 252, they will not affect the devised lands. On this point we have formed no opinion.\nIt remains only to apply the foregoing view of the law of Pennsylvania to the dispositions of the will in question.\n1. To the devise of the eight acre lot to the yearly meeting. We know historically that this has been a religious society from the settlement of the province. We know, from the acts of the legislature, that they Have held real estate, and yet hold it, under deeds from the proprietor, from individuals, and by the laws of the state, guarantied by all its constitutions, have a perfect right and capacity to take, hold and enjoy properly without incorporation, or tenure in mortmain.\n2. The bequest to the monthly meetings of women friends, is for a charitable use, which is good and lawful, and they are capable of taking and distributing the charity, according to the will of the donor, in the most liberal and ample sort.\n3. The bequest of the thirty pounds received by the father of the testatrix from Captain Newcastle, and the interest, we consider to be intended as the payment of a debt which she considered herself to be morally and equitably bound to pay, and therefore direct it to be paid by the executor, as a debt of the estate, to such Indians as are the relations of the said Newcastle, if to be found; if not to be found, to remain subject to the future order of the court.\n4. As to the devises to the Indians, our opinion is, that they are good and valid. That the treasurer of the societies or meetings, or their committees for the time being, are capable of taking and distributing the fund as a trustee under their direction, a,nd that Indians are proper objects of charitable bequests. But they are to be applied to the relief of such Indians as have heretofore been under the care and supervision of the yearly meetings, or their committees respectively, and to be distributed only for such objects and purposes as were customary in the lifetime of the testatrix, such being her manifest intention.\n5. As to all the devises to or for the benefit of the different meetings of Friends in Baltimore, Virginia and Ohio, we are clearly of opinion that they are good and valid in law, and decree accordingly.\n6. As to the bequest to the citizens of Winchester, to purchase a- fire-engine, we consider it good as a charitable use, or one tending to public profit and the safety of property, and in ease of taxes and burdens on the citizens; this is the substance and intent of the bequest, and being given for a good and meritorious object, it is not material by what name it is given, whether to the corporation, or the citizens who compose it, it must take effect, notwithstanding any misnomer or other defects of name, form or circumstance.\n7. The bond of Isaac Zane appearing to us to have been assumed by the testatrix as honestly due by one of her near relations, ought to be considered in equity as a debt due, and he paid by the executor out of her estate, as such was evidently her intention, and from the evidence reported by the master, we think the party now before the court entitled to receive it, and decree accordingly.\n8. We order and decree that the administrator de bonis non make sale of the house and lot in Chestnut street, at such time and place as the court may hereafter direct, or private sale, at his discretion.\n9. Also to make sale of the Marlborough estate in Virginia, in the same manner, if such sale is authorized by the law of Virginia. If such sale is not authorized, then we order and direct the administrator to make application for such authority to the legislature or such judicial tribunal as by the law of that state is competent to authorize such sale, according to the will of the testatrix, or the order of this court.\nWe have been asked to go farther, and decree a sale of all the undevised estate of the testatrix, as necessary to provide a fund to meet the various legacies and bequests; \u2014 the counsel who made the application considering that the residuary clause in the will was to he so construed, that nothing should pass under it till all the former dispositions were satisfied. As the residuary devisees are not before the court, and would not be bound by its decree, we have not considered, and shall express no opinion on that subject \u2014having no power to affect real property in another state, but through the parties in interest, or those having power over it, we must confine our order for the sale of the estate to such parts of it as are in the hands, or within the control of the administrator under the authority of the'will. We have full power to see that the will be faithfully and religiously observed and executed, but none to order a sale not directed to be made by any of its provisions.\n*\nThe following summary list of uses declared by statute and adjudged cases to be valid, as pious and charitable, for which propeity could be held prior to the 43 Eliz. will fully sustain this position. 1.

The statute of 9 Geo. II. never was in force in Pennsylvania, and consequently the law of charitable uses here stands unaffected by it. The courts of equity in this state will not hesitate in supplying any formal defect in the execution of a power by will, in favour of a charity. Pepper's Estate, 1 Pars. Eq. Cas. 436.\n*\nThough the objects of a charity are uncertain, a devise will not fail for want of a trustee capable of taking, if a discretionary power of selecting is vested any where. And such power may be vested in an unincorporated religious association. Thus, a devise of real and personal estate to the monthly meeting of Friends, at Philadelphia, for the northern district, (being an unincorporated religious association) to be applied as a fund for the distribution of good books among poor people in. the back part of Pennsylvania, or to the support of an institution or free school, in or near Philadelphia, was established in a court of equity, against the heirs and representatives of the testator, on a bill by certain members of the meeting, on behalf of themselves and other members. Pickering v. Shotwell, 10 Barr, 23; and see Beaver v. Filson, 8 Barr, 327; Wright v. Linn, 9 Barr, 433.\n*\nA voluntary association of individuals, who have contributed funds for a public purpose, will be regarded as a charity, and, a court of equity in this state has jurisdiction over the parties. Funds supplied by the gift of the crown, or from the legislature, or from private gift, for legal, general or public purposes, are charitable funds, to be administered by a court of equity. Therefore, where money is given by will, gift, or voluntary contribution of individuals, toa voluntary, unincorporated hose company, or fire association, formed for general and public usefulness, without individual emolument or advantage, it is a charity over which a court of equity will exercise control. Thomas v. Ellmaker, 1 Pars. Eq. Cas. 98."},{"case_name":"In re Barry","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6730784\/","date":"1844-05-25","court":"United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York","content":"Betts, J.\nOn the first day of term the petitioner presented in open court and filed his petition praying that \u201cthe people\u2019s writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum may issue in his behalf, directed to Mary Mercein, relict of the late Thomas R. Mercein, deceased, of the city of New York, and to Eliza Anna Barry, wife of the petitioner, commanding them forth with, immediately on the receipt of said writ, to have the body of Mary Mercein Barry, daughter of the petitioner, by them imprisoned or detained, with the time and cause of such imprisonment or detention, before this court, to do and receive what shall then and there be considered of the said Mary Mercein Barry.\u201d The petitioner alleges that he is a native-born subject of the queen of Great Britain, resident in Nova Scotia, and that he has never been naturalized, or claimed naturalization, under the laws of the United States; that in April, 1835, in the city of New York, he intermarried with Eliza Anna, daughter of the late Thomas R. Mercein, a citizen of said city; that in the month of May thereafter he returned to Nova Scotia, accompanied by his wife, and there resided about a year, when he removed his family to the city of New York, where he resided until April, 1838, when he returned to Nova Scotia with a portion of his family, and has continued to reside there from that time; that a son and daughter were born of said marriage during his residence in the city of New York, and on his removal to Nova Scotia he left his wife and two children temporarily with her father in the city of New York; that in the month of May thereafter he returned to New York, when difficulties arose between him and his wife respecting her removal to Nova Scotia, and she declared her determination to part with him, rather than think of going to Nova Scotia; that he remained, in New York until the 28th of June, 1838, and, with a view to arrange amicably the differences between himself and wife, he finally agreed to allow her to continue in New York, at her father\u2019s house, until the 1st day of May, 1839, and to retain in her care their said daughter, Mary Mercein, during that period, and also their son until such time as the petitioner might think proper to require him; that in September following he returned to.New York, and made every possible effort to conciliate his wife, and induce her to consent to go at some future time to her own proper home, in Nova Scotia, but she utterly refusing, and declaring that she had nq expectation of so doing, the petitioner returned himself, taking his son along wdth him; that these attempts to conciliate her were frequently repeated without avail, and the petitioner awaited the expiration of the time he had agreed she should remain with her father, and on the 2d day of May, 1839, formally demanded of the said Thomas R. Mercein the surrender of his said wife and child, which demand was not complied with; that his wife, from that time to the present period, has refused to return to his home, and has absented herself therefrom, contrary to his desires, and has detained, and does still keep from him, unlawfully, his daughter, who is now in the seventh year of her age; that Thomas R. Mercein has lately deceased, and that thereby the wife of the petitioner is, left without any present property, and little or no prospect of any in reversion, and that she has no property whatever of any kind in her own right, and has no means known to the petitioner for the present- or future support of herself and their daughter, and that she resides with, and is harbored in her present vicious and illegal condition by her mother, Mary, relict of the late Thomas R. Mercein. The petitioner alleges his own ability to provide comfortably for the support and education of his daughter, and especially claims that she is a British subject, allegiant to the crown of Great Britain, at least during her minority. The petitioner sets forth many other matters of aggravation in the separation from him, persisted in hy his wife, and the countenance and support of her by her family in her conduct and refusal to return to her home. These particulars it is unnecessary to rehearse, and the right to the remedy or relief claimed by the petitioner is not, in this stage of the case, to be determined by a consideration of the relative conduct of these parents towards each other or the child, or of the advantages to the infant to be placed with the one rather than the other. These matters would he most material if the case had proceeded so far as to require from the court a decision upon the question as to the fit or proper disposal of the infant. The point now to he considered is whether the petitioner lias presented a case coming within the jurisdiction of this court, or, if this court has cognizance of 1 he matter, whether the facts stated hy the petitioner entitle him'to the interference of the court in the manner prayed for.\nThe same petition, in substance, was presented to the supreme court of the United States, at the last term, and was supported by an elaborate argument on the part of the petitioner. The court observes, (Ex parte Barry, 2 How. 65:)\n\u201cIt is the case of a private individual, who is an alien, seeking redress for a supposed wrong done him by another private individual, who is a citizen of \"New York. It is plain, therefore, that this court has no original jurisdiction to entertain the present petition. * * * Without, therefore, entering into the merits of the present application, we are compelled, by our duty, to dismiss the petition, leaving the petitioner to seek redress in such other tribunal of the United States as may be entitled to grant it. If the petitioner has any title to redress in those tribunals, the vacancy in the office of the judge of this court assigned to that circuit and district creates no legal obstruction to the pursuit thereof.\u201d\nThis instruction of the supreme court seems to be regarded by the petitioner as a declaration of that high tribunal that the United States circuit court for this district has the power to grant the relief demanded by the petition. The expression of such opinion by that court, even in an incidental manner, and not on a point under adjudication, would have the highest influence with this court, and would undoubtedly be adopted here as the rule of decision. But the cautious and reserved phraseology employed by the supreme court in respect to the competency of any other United States tribunal to take cognizance of the subject, is, in my opinion, to be regarded rather as an admonition to the inferior courts that grave difficulties rested over the matter, than an assurance to them that their original jurisdiction contained the authority to award the common-law writ of habeas carpus ad subjiciendum prayed for. That court says of itself: \u201cWe cannot issue any writ of habeas corpus, except when it is necessary for the exercise of the jurisdiction, original or appellate, given to it by the constitution or laws of the United States,\u201d \u2014 language plainly not employed to import that a circuit court has in this behalf a capacity transcending that of the supreme court, and can create a jurisdiction to itself by awarding writs of habeas corpus. This opinion of the supreme court, I think, supplies no authority or suggestion in aid of the jurisdiction now invoked, and, taken most favorably for the petitioner, merely leaves the question as to its power to award the writ to be settled by the circuit court in consonance 'with the constitution and laws of the United States. The application to the supreme court was supported by an exposition of this case, intended to show that this petitioner\u2019s claim had been unjustly adjudged against in the courts of this state, and that the interposition of that tribunal was necessary to correct these erroneous judgments, and secure the legal rights of the petitioner. That argument, with the decision of the supreme court on this motion, was also submitted to me with the petition when filed. On the perusal of these papers, I at first hesitated as to the course most proper to be pursued preliminarily, \u2014 whether to-grant a rule against Mrs. Barry and Mrs. Mer-cein to show cause why the writ should not issue, or even to award the writ, with a view to have the entire case spread before the court, or such points presented as would lead to a definite decision of the case. But, as the adoption of either alternative must involve great delay and expense, both in the disposition of the case in the first instance, and in removing it by either party to the supreme court for revision, and as the right of the petitioner to relief in this court, under any aspect of the case, was doubtful. I conceived it the least expensive and more convenient course to inquire and decide whether the petitioner presented a ease of which this court should take cognizance.\nWhen the cause of imprisonment or detention shown by the petition satisfies the court that the prisoner would be remanded if brought up, the writ will not be awarded. Watkins\u2019 Case, 3 Pet. 201, per Marshall, C. J.; Milburn\u2019s Case, 9 Pet. 706; 2 Story, Const. p. 207, \u00a7 1341; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75. The practice in the English courts is the same. Bac. Abr. \u201cHabeas Corpus,\u201d B 4, cases cited; 4 Com. Dig. (Day\u2019s Ed.) 550, and note 3; Hallam\u2019s Const. Law, 20; Penrice's Case, 2 Mod. 306; Slater v. Slater, 1 Lev. 1; King v. Marsh, 3 Bulst. 27; White v. Wiltsheire, 2 Rolle, 138. If, upon the facts stated by the petitioner, it shall be determined that the court cannot grant the relief prayed for, either for want of jurisdiction, or because the law is against his demand, it would be inexpedi-entand oppressive to cause the partiesimplicated to be arraigned before this court, and held under its control, pending the discussion and consideration of the subject, .and, accordingly, upon the doubts arising from a perusal of the papers, I deemed it proper to invite the petitioner in the first instance to support his petition by arguing these two points: (1) Whether the United States circuit court has jurisdiction over the subject-matter of his petition. (2) If such jurisdiction exists, do the facts stated upon the petition give the petitioner, under the law of the land, a title to the remedy prayed for? The petitioner has read an argument, prepared with great research and ability, in support of the affirmative of both inquiries, bringing into review numerous English and American decisions upon the same question, and has submitted the manuscript to the examination of the court. With the aid of this most amjjle discus sion of Ibis subject, I proceed to pronounce the result of my reflections upon tins interesting and important case.\nThe incongruity of awarding proofs, at the instance of husband or wife, to take away an infant child from the parent having it in nurture and keeping, upon the allegation that such keeping is a wrongful imprisonment, is most palpable and striking. It is a bold figure of speech, or rather fiction, to which the law ought not to resort, unless indispensably necessary to be employed in preservation of parental rights, or the personal fondness of the child. The courts, however, assume such supposi-titious imprisonment to exist as the foundation for jurisdiction, to a limited extent, over the detention of infants, even by their parents, on the ground that the writ is rather to be considered a proceeding in the name and behalf of the sovereign than by one named person against the other. Com. v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203. There is no reason to doubt that originally the common-law writ was granted solely in cases of arrest and forcible imprisonment under color or claim of warrant of law. As late as 2 James II., the court expressly denied its allowance in a case of detention or restraint by a private person, (Rex v. Drake, Comb. 35; 16 Vin. Abr. 213;) and the habeas corpus act of Charles II., which is claimed as the Magna Charta of British liberty, has relation only to imprisonment on criminal charges. 3 Bac. Abr. 438, note. It is not important to inquire at what period the writ was first employed to place infant children under the disposal of courts of law and equity. This was clearly so in England anterior to our Revolution, (Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange, 982; Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burrows, 1434; Blissets' Case, Lofft, 748,) and the practice has been fully confirmed in the continued assertion of the authority by those courts unto the present day, (King v. De Manneville, 5 East, 221; De Manneville v. De Manneville, 10 Ves. 52; Ball v. Ball, 2 Sim. 35; Ex parte Skinner, 9 Moore, 278; King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624;) and this indifferently, whether the interposition of the court is demanded by the father or mother, (King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624; Ex parte Skinner, 9 Moore, 278.) The late act of 2 & 3 Vict. c. 54, (1839,) sanctions the principle, and would seem to reinstate the old dictum, that the judgment and discretion of the court is not to bo controlled by any supposed legal right of the lather in exclusion of that of the mother, if the infant be within the age of seven years. An act of the state of New York passed in 1830 had established the same doctrine within this state by positive law; and, independent of this statute, the course of the American courts in this respect had been substantially in consonance with the decisions in England antecedent to the Revolution. In re McDowle, 8 Johns. 253; In re Waldron, 13 Johns. 418; In re Wollstonecraft, 4 Johns. Ch. 80; People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 47; Com. v. Addicks, 5 Bin. 520; Com. v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203; State v. Smith, 6 Greenl. 462. The later cases in New York are founded upon a principle common to all the decisions iqited. People v. -, 19 Wend. 16; Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 80; People v. Mercein, 3 Hill, 400. But, in solaras they may seem to favor the latest adjudications in England, in respect to the fixed and controlling-right of the father, as the true exposition of the common-law rule, they are modified and overruled by the decisions of the court of errors. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 106, and Sittings 1844, MSS. The petitioner-in this case asks of the court the award of the common-law writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, with all of its common-law attributes and efficacy. That is a high mandate, by means of which courts or judges, in protection of the liberty of individuals, exercise functions appertaining to the sovereign power, and which, in intendment of law, rest only in the sovereign, and are co-extensive with his dominion. Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 627, 629. The writ is purely one of prerogative. Whether emanating from a king or a state; whether returnable before the king in person, as it undoubtedly was in its origin, or awarded and acted upon by magistrates as surrogates of the sovereign authority, \u2014 it has always been made to bring the party imprisoned directly before the supreme pow'er, that, if there be not due cause of law for his detention, the sovereign-may set him free of his restraint. 3 Bl. Comm. 131; Bac. Abr. \u201cHabeas Corpus,\u201d 421; 2 Story, Const. 207; Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 202; 2 Kent, Comm. 26, 29. In respect to married women or other adults held in detention by private individuals, the sovereign, through this writ, acts as conservator pads and cusios mormn, and, in regard to infant children, as parens patrios, taking, in these high capacities, summary order that the party be forthwith set at liberty, if improperly and wrongfully detained. Blissets' Case, Lofft, 748; In re Waldron, 13 Johns. 418; People v. Chegaray, 18 Wend. 637; People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 48; U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482. The state thus acting upon the assumption that its parentage supersedes all authority conferred by birth on the natural parents, takes upon itself the power and right to dispose of the custody of children as it shall judge best for their welfare. People v. Chegaray, 18 Wend. 642, 643; Blissets\u2019 Case, Lofft, 748. The cases before cited show that the English and American courts act in this behalf solely upon the assertion of the right of the sovereign whose power the administer to continue or change the custody of the child at his discretion, as parens patriae, allowing the infant, if of competent age, to elect for himself; if not, making the election for him. Even in the extraordinary conclusions drawn from the facts brought to light in Com. v. Addicks, 5 Bin. 520, and King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624, both courts, in denying that these facts called for any change of the custody of the children, readjudged the principle that it -was their province, at common law, authoritatively to decide that question according to their legal discretio.n.\nDoes this common-law prerogative in relation to infants vest in the government of the United States, and has the circuit court competent authority to exercise it? The argument bearing upon the first branch of this inquiry assumes two propositions as its basis: (1) That the government of the United States is supreme over all subjects within its cognizance; and (2) that the common law of England is embodied with, and has become a measure and source of authority to, the national government, and is to be enforced in the circuit court whenever persons competent to sue in those courts prosecute their rights therein. It is believed that neither of these propositions can be maintained, and cer tainly not in respect to the subject-matter of this proceeding. Many of the powers of the general government are unquestionably supreme and exclusive, while others, especially those in relation to remedies afforded by its courts to private suitors, are only concurrent with similar powers possessed by the state governments. If the power in respect to parties competent to sue in the national federal courts could he supposed to exist, in its absolute sense, in the United States government, its exercise has been modified and restricted by congress in the eleventh section of the act of September 24, 1789, which gives the circuit courts no more than' a concurrent jurisdiction with the state courts of suits of a civil nature at common Jaw. 1 U. S. St. at Large, 78. Nor, again, do all attributes of sovereignty devolve upon the national government. Whether considered as emanating directly from the people in their aggregate capacity, or as proceeding from the states in their independent organization and character, the government of the Union is one of special powers, defined or necessarily implied in the terms of the grant. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 407; 2 Story, Const. \u00a7 1907; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657. Though the point has been labored with ability by a late jurist of eminence in this department of legal learning, to deduce from the circumstances attendant upon the establishment of this government that the common lawr became embodied in it, as an efficient principle of its authority and action, (I)up. Jur. 85-90,) yet the doctrine has never been declared or sanctioned by our courts. So far as the decisions have gone, they tend to repudiate the principle in loto. U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32; U. S. v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat. 415. There is, accordingly, no sure foundation for the assumption that the federal government possesses common-law prerogatives, inherent in the sovereign, which can he exercised without authority of positive law. Martin v. Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 329. If any common-law prerogative in relation to the administration of justice can bo proved to exist in the sovereignty of the United States, it must, upon the same principle, ho endowed with all such prerogatives, and can, on the like authority, unless inhibited by positive law, award writs of mandamus, quo warranto, ne exeat, or mandates to citizens abroad to return home on pain of confiscation of their estates, (Com. Dig. \u201cPrerogatives\u201d I) 34, 35,) or this writ of habeas corpus; they being all common-law writs ejusdem generis. That such attributes or functions of sovereignty cannot be inherent in the United States government necessarily results from the character of the government, and the objects of its constitution. It is not designed, in its organization or aim, to regulate the individual or municipal relations of the citizen. These are left under the dominion of the state government; and there accordingly exists no relation between the nation and the individuals which affords foundation lor these prerogatives. The social or personal duties or liabilities of the citizens come within the control of the general government only when remitted to its charge by a special cession of authority, and then solely to the end that such regulations as are of a federal character may be enforced, as in relation to land and naval forces and persons in the employ of the United States, the punishment of offenses, etc.; hut in other re spects the national government does not supply the law governing the citizen in his domestic or individual capacity. These particulars appertain to the institutions and policy of the respective states.\nThis reasoning, however, may not be supposed to meet fully the case presented by the petitioner; for although, in the abstract, there may be no prerogative authority in the head of the United States government, yet the argument would maintain that its courts of justice, as organized, may possess all the powers exercised by superior courts at common law, and the issuing and acting upon writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum become thereby a branch of jurisdiction necessarily incident to the constitution of such courts. This hypothesis overlooks the peculiar foundation of the United States judiciary, and the allotment of its functions in respect to the powers of the states. The federal government came into force co-ordinately with, or as the concomitant of, state governments at the time existing, and in the full exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial sovereignty. These sovereignties are left entire, under the action of the general government, except in so far only as the powers are transferred to the federal head by the constitution, or are by that prohibited to the states, or, in some few instances, are allotted to be exercised concurrently by the two governments. The United States judiciary is constituted and put in action in the several states, in subordination to this fundamental principle of the Union, and empowered to exercise only such peculiar and special supremacy, and not one in its absolute sense. To render this connection of the United States judiciary with that of the states more intimate and entire, and to take away all implication that it was a paramount power, acting irrespective of state laws, or that it possessed, or could exercise, any inherent jurisdiction countervailing those laws, the act of congress organizing the courts establishes it as an element in their procedure that the laws of the state where the court sits shall be its- rule of decision in common-law cases. It necessarily results, gs a consequence of this special character of the United States judiciary, that it can possess no powers other than those specifically conferred by the' constitution or laws of the Union, and such incidents thereto as are necessary. to the proper execution of its jurisdiction. All other judicial powers necessary to the complement of supreme authority remain with, and are exercised by, the states. This doctrine is sufficiently indicated in the decision of the supreme court made in this case at the last term, and it has been invariably recognized from the earliest adjudications of the court. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 432, 435; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75; Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201; Kendall v. U.S., 12 Pet. 524. The jurisdiction of the United States courts depends exclusively on the constitution and laws of the United States, and they can neither in criminal nor civil cases resort to the common law as a source of jurisdiction. U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32; U. S. v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat. 415; Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., 432; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75; Town of Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 333; Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 477; Craig v. Missouri, 4 Pet. 444; Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 658; The Orleans v. Ph\u0153bus, 11 Pet. 175; Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 524.\nIt is now argued that this principle is limited to the supreme court, hut that, in respect to the circuit courts, they have a common-law jurisdiction incident to their constitution, inasmuch as judicial sovereignty resides in them, rendering the range of their original jurisdiction coextensive with the subjects of litigation arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and because all remedies not otherwise provided are, in the exercise of that judicial sovereignty, to bo in conformity to the common law. Although the speculations of our most eminent jurists may countenance this argument, (Dup. Jur. 85; 1 Kent, Comm. 341,) yet it has not received the sanction of the United States courts. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 435; Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 616, per curiam, and 626, Chief Justice Taney; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75; Chief Justice Marshall, Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 477; Lorman v. Clarke, 2 McLean, 569. The distinction established by the cases is clear and practical, and embraces all United States courts alike, and is, in effect, that those courts derive no jurisdiction from the common law, but that, in those cases in which jurisdiction is appointed by statute, and attaches, the remedies in these courts are to be according to the principles of the common law. Bains v. The James and Catherine, 1 Baldw. 558; Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 223; U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32; Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38; Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204; Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 477. It is not, accordingly, conclusive of their right to take cognizance of the subject-matter, to show that the parties connected therewith are competent to sue or be sued in the United States courts, and that there is a perfect right of action or defense thereupon supplied such parties at common law. The evidence must go further, and prove that the particular subject-matter is one over which the courts are by act of congress appointed to act, or that the question has relation to the remedy alone, and not to the jurisdiction of the court. U. S. v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 389; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 407; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 721.\nThe authority to lake cognizance of the detention of infants by private persons, not held under claim or color or warrant of law, rests solely, in England, on the common law. It is one of the eminent prerogatives of the crown, which implies in the monarch the guardianship of infants paramount to that of their natural parents. The royal prerogative, at first exercised personally ad libitum by the king, (Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 630,) and afterwards, for his relief, by special officers, as the lord high constable, the lord high admiral, and the lord chancellor, in process of time devolved upon the high courts of equity and law, and in them this exalted one, of allowing and enforcing the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, became vested as an elementary branch of their jurisdiction. In the performance, however, of this high function in respect to the detention of infants by parents, etc., the court or judge still acts with submission to the original principle out of which it sprang, that infants ought to bo left where found, or to be taken from that custody and transferred to some other, at the discretion of the prerogative guardian, and according to its opinion of their best interest and safety. The reference already made to the origin and object of our Federal Union demonstrates that no prerogative of this character could be exercised as an incident to its qualified and peculiar sovereignty; and I think it equally clear that the inherent authority of no branch of the judiciary can transcend that of the government in this behalf, and that it -has no capacity to issue this writ, or act upon it, except under appointment by positive law. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 93.\nIt remains, then, only to consider whether such jurisdiction is conferred upon the circuit courts by statute; for, even if the language of the constitution might import such authority to be within the competency of the judiciary, it is authoritatively established that the circuit courts, at least, cannot exercise jurisdiction as to individual rights, because authorized by the constitution, unless congress has specifically assigned it to them. They possess no jurisdiction other than that which both the constitution and acts of congress concur in conferring upon them. Turner v. Bank, 4 Dall. 10; Bank v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61; Livingston v. Van Ingen, 1 Paine, 45; Browne v. Strode, 5 Cranch, 303; Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 524; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 93; McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598. The ninth section of the first article of the constitution, par. 2, declaring that \u201cthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpws-shall not be suspended unless, when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,\u201d does not purport to convey power or jurisdiction to the judiciary. It is in restraint of executive and legislative powers, and no further affects the judiciary than to impose on them the necessity, if the privilege of habeas corpus is suspended by any authority, to decide whether the exigency demanded by the constitution exists to sanction the a.ct. So, although the second section of the third article gives the United States judiciary jurisdiction over all cases in law' and equity between our own citizens and the citizens or subjects of foreign states, yet, as already shown, the circuit court cannot, under that provision, act on one of the subjects without an express authorization by statute. McClung v. Silliman, 6 Wheat. 598. In our government the judiciary power acts only to give effect to'the voice of the legislature. Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 866. The material question in the case must, accordingly, be, whether congress has given to the circuit courts the special jurisdiction appealed to by the petitioner.\nJudge Story holds that the courts of the United States are vested v'ith full authority to issue the great writ of habeas eorpus in cases properly within the jurisdiction of the national government. 2 Story, Const. \u00a7 1341. The general doctrine the commentator is discussing, and the authorities supporting it, have relation to the law as it exists in England and in the respective states of the Union. The only ease referred to as giving application of the general doctrine to the United States courts is that of Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75. That was a case of imprisonment on a criminal charge, under and by color of the authority of the United States, the prisoners having been committed by the circuit court of the District of Columbia on a charge of treason against the United States; and the supreme court held that, though it could not take cog nizance of the mailer under any common-law jurisdiction, yet the act of congress of September 24, 1789, had conferred the jurisdiction, and they proceeded, by virtue of the statute, to exercise it in the case. The court nowhere advert to an implied power in the circuit courts broader than that vested in the supreme court, which would empower a circuit court to grant the writ Upon the footing of a general jurisdiction in respect to the parties to be affected by it. The positions adopted as the basis of the decision would seem to look to an entirely opposite conclusion. Chief Justice Marshall says: \u201cCourts which originate in the common law possess a jurisdiction which must be regulated by the common law, until some statute shall change their established principles; but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction. * * * It extends,\u201d in case of United States courts, \u201conly to the power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals, or between the government and individuals. To enable the court to decide on such question, the power to determine it must be given by written law.\u201d This language of the chief justice is explicit against the theory that the United States courts have necessarily cognizance of all subjects of litigation arising between parties over whom they have jurisdiction. So in respect to another prerogative writ, that of mandamus, the supreme court, in disavowring in itself the power to issue it in the common-law sense, holds, in terms not less definite and decisive, that the circuit courts cannot award it but by virtue of express authority from statute, (Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 524;) and this conclusion has no exclusive connection with the particular writ of'mandamus, but flows from the doctrine definitely announced by the court, that the United States judiciary has no authority to award prerogative writs of any character further than the power is specifically given by statute.\nThe relator refers to the argument of counsel in the case of Ex parte Bollman, as demonstrating that the fourteenth section of the act of congress of September 24, 1789, imparts to the United States courts authority as ample as exists in the supreme courts of judicature at common law in the application and enforcement of the writ of habeas corpus. No judicial decision, unless it be that of U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482, is found which sanctions that exposition of the statute; and it accordingly becomes necessary to examine with attention the foundation of the construction contended for. The terms of the statute are\u2014\n\u201cThat all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law, and that either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpas for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment: provided, that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless when they are in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.\u201d\nThe scope and purport of this enactment were very carefully considered by the supreme court. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75; Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201. The courts being authorized to issue the writ \u201cfor the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment,\u201d the supreme court regarded the provisions of the act as incorporating in a considerable degree the English law on the subject, and that the statute of 31 Charles II. had defined the cases in England in which relief could be had under the writ by persons detained in custody, and wras an enforcement of the common law in that respect. The argument of the court tends clearly to the conclusion that our act was to be construed as aj^plicable to the cases embraced within the English habeas corpus act, and as framed in reference to the law established by that statute. If the term \u201c commitment\u201d in our act is used in its common acceptation, it would have reference to the forcible confinement of a person under color of legal protest or authority. In its common-law sense, it imports an imprisonment under a warrant or order on a criminal charge, and no other, (4 Bl. Comm. 296; 2 Hawk. P. C. c. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 13-15;) and, under the statute, all the judges of England decided that the act of Charles did not extend to any cases of imprisonment, detainer, or restraint whatsoever, except cases of commitment for criminal, or supposed criminal, matters. 3 Bac. Abr. 438, note. Asourstatute uses the term \u201ccommitment,\u201dand drops the limitation of it in the English act, \u201cfor any criminal or supposed criminal matter,\u201d it may be reasonable, in favor of liberty, to understand it in its broadest signification. A court of deservedly high character decided that under our statute a writ of habeas corpus lies to inquire into the cause of commitment, though made on civil process. Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 476. See, also, Bank v. Jenkins, 18 Johns. 309. But it is to be borne in mind that the supreme court hesitated as to the soundness of this interpretation of the statute, for in Ex parte Wilson, Chief Justice Marshall, after consultation -with the judges, on a motion for a habeas corpus, stated that the court was not satisfied that a habeas corpus is the proper remedy in a case of arrest under civil process, (6 Cranch, 52,) and the writ was denied; and to the same effect was the decision of the supreme court of New York. Cable v. Cooper, 15 Johns. 152. If the more extended interpretation of the term be adopted, and cases of commitment for civil or criminal matters may be brought under-review by habeas corpus, yet, in view of the qualified character of the federal government, and the special jurisdiction of its judiciary, the more reasonable inference would be that congress intended the protection of this writ should be interposed by its courts only in cases of imprisonment under color or claim of the authority of the United States. Rawle, an eminent commentator on the constitution, says that the w'rit of habeas corpus is restrained to imprisonments under the authority of the United States. Rawle, Const. 115. Every adjudicated case in the United States courts, with one exception, has been under writs sued out for relief against an actual arrest of a party under process, or his confinement by claim of authority of the United States. U. S. v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. 17; U. S. v. Johns, 4 Dall. 412; Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch, 447; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 75; Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38; Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201; Ex parte Milburn, 9 Pet. 704; U. S. v. Bainbridge, 1 Mason, 71; Ex parte Cabrera, 1 Wash. C. C. 232; Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock. 447, in which a doubt is made whether the writ may not apply in case of imprisonment on civil process. Judge WASHINGTON, on habeas corpus, adjudged the matter not within the cognizance of the circuit court because the prisoner was not in custody by authority of the United States, and was not committed for trial before any of its courts. Ex parte Cabrera, 1 Wash. C. C. 237. The proviso to the fourteenth section, above recited, looks to such limitations of the writ. It is palpable that congress did not intend that an inquiry into the cause of commitment of a person detained should authorize the United States courts to interfere with his custody unless the subject-matter upon which he was confined was to be acted on and decided by the United States tribunals. This policy of the statute is emphatically indicated by the act of March 2, 1833, c. 57, \u00a7 7, in which special powers are conferred on the United States courts to liberate by habeas corpus even persons confined under authority of state law, for any act done, or omitted to be done, in pursuance of a law of the United States, or in pursuance of any order, process, or decree of any judge or court thereof. Both clauses denote that it was the violation of a law of the United States, or its just authority, in the imprisonment of the citizen, that was intended by congress to be inquired into and remedied by habeas corpus before the courts of the United States.\nMy opinion upon this review of this subject is that there is no foundation for the claim that there is vested in the United States government a common-law prerogative, or that the circuit court can, upon the footing of common-law prerogative, by writ of habeas corpus, assume and exercise this function of parens patriue in relation to infant children held in detention by private individuals, not acting under color of authority from the laws of the United States. And it also seems equally clear to me that the authority given by the fourteenth section of the judiciary act to issue writs of habeas corpus \u201cfor the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment\u201d necessarily restricts the jurisdiction of the courts to commitments under process or authority of the United States. I should, upon the conclusions against the competency of the court to take cognizance of the matter, feel constrained to deny the petition, but for the decision of the circuit court in the first circuit, in an analogous case, where the relief now prayed for was granted. U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482. The jurisdiction of the court was not brought in question, and was undoubtedly conceded by the parties; but the acquiescence in ,a legal proposition so important by a judge of the exact and varied learning of Judge Story, and one whose judicial habit is so cautious and investigating, is an imposing authority in its support. A citizen of New York sued out a habeas corpus against a citizen of Rhode Island, the grandfather of his infant child, to recover possession of the child, which was retained and defended against the demand of the father. The court took cognizance of the subject-matter, and after full hearing decided the ques tion of rightful custody, upon its merits, in favor of the father. It is supposed that the circuit court possessed such authority under the provisions of the eleventh and fourteenth sections of the judiciary act. The eleventh section gives' circuit courts original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, etc., when one party is a citizen of the state where the suit is brought, and the other an alien, etc. 1 St. at Large, 78. It is well settled that congress has not in this section exhausted the powers vested in them by the second section of the third article of the constitution, and imparted to the circuit courts cognizance of all cases at common law which might be within the control of the legislative power. Turner v. Bank, 4 Dall. 11; Bank v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61. The supreme court say there is, manifestly, some limitation to the authority of the circuit courts in respect to the cases therein brought within the purview of their jurisdiction, and that those courts have not jurisdiction, under the eleventh section, of all suits or cases of a civil nature at common law. Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 616. Two particulars must concur as the foundation of a suit in a circuit court, \u2014 that the litigant parties be competent to sue and be sued, and that the subject-matter be one over which the court has cognizance. Voorhees v. Bank, 10 Pet. 474. A procedure by habeas corpus can in no legal sense be regarded as a suit or controversy between private parties. It is an inquisition by the government \u2014 at the suggestion and instance of an individual; most probably, but still in the name and capacity of the sovereign \u2014 to ascertain whether the infant in this case is wrongfully detained, and in a way conducive to its prejudice. Neither in England or the states in this country does the court regard this as a suit in -which the right of guardianship is to be discussed or decided. Rex v. Smith, 2 Strange, 982; People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 48; In re Wollstonecraft, 4 Johns. Ch. 80; In re McDowle, 8 Johns. 253. Judge Story, in the case cited, manifestly took the same view of the subject. U. S. v. Green, 3 Mason, 482.\nThere would, moreover, be a technical objection to this proceeding, if a suit, which the court might not be permitted to overlook. Neither in this country nor in England can an action be prosecuted by an individual in the name of the government without express authority of the court, or the officer appointed by law to represent the public. And no distinction is made between actions popular in their nature, and those in which the private suitor is solely the party in interest. The authority .of the circuit court to take cognizance of the case must, probably, then, be deduced from the provisions of the fourteenth section, in conjunction with those of the eleventh; and the first clause or branch of the fourteenth section must be accepted as giving the courts of the. United States power to issue the writ of habeas corpus, without the restriction of the subsequent clause, to \u201cthe purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment.\u201d And the eleventh section must be regarded as supplying the parties in -whose behalf such general power may be exercised. The argument was pressed with great earnestness before the supreme court, in Bollman and Swartuiout\u2019s Case, that the first clause of this section was to be interpreted as a positive and absolute grant of power, (4 Cranch, 82;) but the court does not seem to have yielded to that construction, for in reference to that point they say that \u2019'\u2018the true sense of the words is to be determined by the nature of the provision and by the context.\u201d Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 94. And they evidently regard the whole section as having relation to one and the same matter. The principles established by the supreme court, and brought in review in that case, would seem to militate so strongly against the doctrine involved in the ease of U. S. v. Green as to prevent this court adopting the latter as its guide in determining this point; but, without asserting that such diversity exists in the judgments of the supreme and circuit courts, and admitting that the decision in 3 Mason stands unimpaired as an authority, I proceed to consider the remaining general inquiry, \u2014 whether, by the law of the land, the petitioner is entitled to the relief asked for.\nWhat, then, is the law which this court administers? For that will be the law of the land in respect to these parties and the subject-matter of this petition. The argument assumes it to be the common law of England, as declared and enforced by her courts, and that the most recent adjudications in those tribunals arc the highest and most important evidence of whatthe law is, and must supply the rule of decision to the UnitedStates courts. This view of the subject disregards the special organization of the United States circuit courts, and the limited purposes they were designed to subserve. They are distributed among the states, to exercise that special jurisdiction bestowed upon the federal government, or shared with it by the state sovereignties, and not to carry with them an inherent power to resort to or employ any other law than that given them by express and written grant. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 432-435; Ex parte Barry, 2 How. 65. Although the people brought with them, on their emigration to this country, the essential principles of the common law, and embodied them in their institutions, yet this was not done by them in a national capacity, (at the time no such character or capacity was contemplated,) but as distinct communities independent of each other. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 435; Bains v. The James and Catherine, 1 Baldw. 557. Nor has the common law been adopted by the United States as a system applicable to the states generally, and to be administered as such in the national courts. Kendall v. U. S., 12 Pet. 621. This has been done specifically by act of congress in relation to the District of Columbia, (Id.;) but in respect to the states the common law is regarded in force only as adopted or modified by the constitution, statutes, or usages of the states, respectively. It came to them, and was appropriated by them, and became an integral portion of the laws of the particular states, before the United States government had existence. 1 Story, Comm. cc. 16, 17; 1 Kent, Comm. 471, and notes; Town of Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 333; Southwick v. Postmaster General, 2 Pet. 446. In bringing this new government into action amid sovereignties already organized and established, it would be a cardinal object to have the limited share of judicial authority possessed by the national judiciary administered, as far as practicable, in consonance with the laws and usages of the state where the court was placed. Political considerations of the highest moment would exact this. The disquietude and jealousy in relation to this new power would be aggravated tenfold, if, in addition to its authority under a|)pointment of positive law, it could by its inherent jurisdiction supplant local customs and usages, and substitute in their place the common law of England in its primitive plenitude and vigor. There was a deep-rooted attachment in the states to their own laws and customs, while every influence acting on! the public mind at that day would tend to induce alarm and distrust of English law, except only in \u25a0so far as it had already been modified and adopted by express authority of the states. All the early legislation of congress manifests the purpose to affiliate the new system -with that of the state, and, especially in the jurisprudence as between individuals, to have the writs of the one government or the other organs of the same law, and controlled by a common rule of decision. This principle was varied only when the constitution of the United States, treaties, or acts of congress provided a specific law for the case. Acccordingly, when congress assigned to the circuit courts sitting within the states \u201coriginal cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of a civil nature at common law,\u201d it was careful to direct \u201cthat the laws of the several states, except where the constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States shall otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.\u201d Act Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 34. The supreme court has recently decided that the decisions of the state courts are not laws of the state, within the purview of this section of the act of congress, in questions of a commercial character, and that such questions are to be determined according to general principles of mercantile law recognized by American and English authorities. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1. Phe argument upon which the decision is founded insists that only the statutes of the state, or long-established local customs having the force of laws, are embraced within the language of the elause, and that the court has always understood the section to apply solely to state laws, strictly local, \u2014 positive statutes, \u2014 and their construction by the state tribunals, and to rights and titles to things having a permanent locality, immovable, and intraterritorial in their nature or character. This exposition by the supreme court, so far as it covers this question, is the law of the land, to the same extent and with equal force with the statute itself; and, although a state statute which should declare the laws of the United States a rule'of decision in commercial questions would scarcely be understood to exclude this decision as appertaining to that character, yet under the authority of that adjudication, this court is bound to regard only certain classes of decisions made by the state tribunals as laws of the state, within contemplation of the judiciary act, whatever may be their authority within the state itself. But it would seem, from the opinion of the supreme court, that long-established local customs, having the form of laws, come within the terms of the section, and must be followed by the United States courts as. rules of decision, and that the decisions of the state courts are evidence of what the laws of the state are. The court in the same opinion declare that the decisions of the state courts upon even commercial questions are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of the supreme court, though they do not supply positive rules or conclusive authority. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 19. This decision confirms the general doctrine, before stated, that the circuit court is bound to administer the laws of the state. It perhaps renders indefinite and ambiguous, to some degree, the methods by which the United States court is to ascertain and determine what that law is, \u2014 whether, if it is not found on the statute-book, it is to be authenticated by the dicta and decisions of English jurists, or by the adjudications of the local judicatories.\nThe proposition on which the petition rests is that a subject of the queen of Great Britain, resident in Nova Scotia, is entitled, as father of a female child under the ago of seven years, born within this state, tc have that child taken by writ of habeas corpus from the keeping of its mother, and transferred by the judgment of this court to his custody; the mother being a native and resident of this state, but residing in the family of her parents, separate from her husband, and without liis consent, and refusing to cohabit with him. Do the laws of the state of New York give him that right; and, if they do, can they be enforced in this court? The United States courts cannot take cognizance of matters of right created or conferred by local statutes. It is to be presupposed that a case at common law exists, of which the United States court acquires jurisdiction under an act of congress; and the determination of that right is then to be made in conformity with the state law. It is accordingly unnecessary to consider the question which has been raised in the state courts, whether, under the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. p. 477, \u00a7 88,) there exists in this slate any common-law right or remedy by habeas corpus, because, if the eleventh and fourteenth sections of the judiciary act bring the case within the jurisdiction of this court, it must proceed to adjudicate on it conformably to the general principles of the common law of England, (Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 201,) unless that rule is varied by the local laws. \u00d1or need the point be discussed, whether, if an infant is brought before this court on habeas corpus, on the application of its father or guardian, the court can act on the matter as if the writ were presented at the instance of the mother, and accordingly regard the provisions in the Revised Statutes as the rule of decision for governing the case. 2 Rev. St. p. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.\nThe question now is whether the petitioner can demand as his legal right the writ prayed for, on the facts stated in his petition. The present posture of the case does not raise the point whether the individual cause of action has been adjudicated and settled by the state' courts, so as to bar the party from again prosecuting it; but the proposition to be determined is one general in its nature, \u2014 whether the facts stated in this petition entitle any party, as matter of right, to relief by a habeas corpus. This subject has undergone a most searching discussion before various tribunals of the state. , Two of the local judges and the chancellor, on these facts, allowed a writ, but refused to award the custody of the child to the father. People v. Mercein, 8 Paige, 47. The supreme court, on full discussion, adopted a different conclusion, and by two solemn decisions adjudged that the father, under such a state of facts, -was by law untitled to the custody of the infant child. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 82; People v. Mercein, 3 Hill, 405. These judgments of the supreme court were reviewed on error in the court of errors, and both reversed that tribunal. Mercein v. People, 25 Wend. 106; MSS. Ops. Sess. 1844. The supreme court based their decisions upon the doctrines of the common law, and not upon the terms of the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. p. 466, \u00a7 23,) the language of which certainly comprehends the broadest range ever given the writ by the English courts, and might very plausibly be urged as extending it to matters not before embraced within that remedy. Revisers\u2019 notes, 3 Rev. St. 784. The substance of the enactment is that a habeas corpus shall issue on the application of any person (by petitions signed by himself, or another in his behalf) \u201ccommitted, detained, confined, or restrained of his liberty, for any criminal or supposed crinrinal matter, or under any pretense whatsoever,\u201d (2 Rev. St. p. 466, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 25,) with some exceptions that need not now be noticed. It must, therefore, be regarded .as the settled law of this state, so far forth as the decision of the court of errors, twice rendered on this point, can furnish the law, that the keeping of an infant female child under \u2019seven years of age) from its father, by the mother, living separate from hinr, and who has it in her nurture, is not, in judgment of law, a detention or restraint of the liberty of the child, and that the father is not entitled by writ of habeas corpus to have such possession of the mother adjudged illegal, nor to have the custody of the child awarded him.\nThese decisions have been stigmatized on the argument as outrages upon the common-law doctrine on this subject, and as devoid of all claims to professional consideration and respect. Most earnest efforts were made to place them in disparaging contrast with the opinions of the individual judges of the supreme court, whose judgments upon the point are overruled by the court of errors; and this, not by weighing the arguments of one tribunal against those of the other on the subject, but by sharp invectives against the constitution of that high court, and the competency of its individual members. This court was solicitous to allow the petitioner the opportunity to discuss his case in all its bearings, and, as his language \u2022was decorous in terms, did not feel called upon to check the course of remarks conducing, and palpably intended, to impute ignorance or disregard of the law, in this respect, to that high tribunal; but I should do injustice to my own convictions if I omitted to observe that, on a careful perusal of the opinions leading to the decisions of the respective courts on this subject, I discover nothing in the ultimate judgments of the court of errors which places that judicatory in disadvantageous contrast- with the one whose opinion it reviews and reverses. Every lawyer, however, is well aware that a decision is not to be estimated merely by the ability or learning displayed in its composition, but, essentially, by the sanction it obtains. . Of what value towards establishing a principle, or fixing a rule of law, is the most erudite opinion of a high judge, when the full bench to whom it is submitted adopts a different conclusion, although sub silentio? What court or lawyer, in searching for and applying a rule of law, rests upon the dissenting arguments of judges in the courts of this country or England, whatever be their grade or reputation? The judgment sanctioned by the court can alone answer the exigencies, and meet the inquiry. The more elevated the rank of the court may be, the higher becomes the sanction of its judgments. Every system of jurisprudence imports in its organization that, upon questions mooted from tribunal to tribunal, the judgment of the one of last resort is conclusive proof of what the law is upon the points in dispute; and this entirely irrespective of the qualifications of the members of such dernier court. A barrister would not be permitted to argue in Westminster Hall that a decision of the house of lords on a writ of error weighed nothing, in settling the law of the case, in comparison with the reasonings of the individual judges on the case in the courts below. A decision by the house of lords ends all question before every tribunal of the kingdom as to the point adjudicated, and this is certainly not founded upon the fact that any extraordinary judicial learning or experience exists in that body, or is brought to act on the subject-matter. That court is lauded by Sir William Blackstone, and English writers generally, as one of the eminently excellent features of the British constitution, and as the most august tribunal in the world. Its judgments of reversal annihilate the decisions of the courts of Ireland and Scotland, rendered unanimously by all the judges, and also of the lord chancellor, and all the judges, barons, and lords of English courts of law and equity; and no party, subject or foreigner, can be permitted to gainsay the efficiency and wisdom of such final determination. And yet, in that court, on the decision of appeals from Ireland and Scotland, in admiralty and in equity, the lord chancellor almost invariably sits and acts as sole judge. Lord Bkouguau asserts that he rarely or ever, when lord chancellor, could obtain the assistance of any other member of the court to sit with him on review of his own decisions, and that he, solely, had to decide questions brought from the Irish and Scotch courts, where all the members of those tribunals had concurred in judgment upon points resting on local and peculiar laws. When the house of lords sits on writs of error, only three lords need bo in attendance. No more, in fact, do attend; and these three may change daily. And it results, in practice, that the three noble lords who ultimately decide that the 12 judges of England have erred in their opinion of the law were neither of them present at the argument on the writ of error. These facts arc asserted by Lord Bkougiiam, in the face of the house of lords, and stand uucon-tradicted. 2 Chit. Pr. p. 587, note A. Whatever obloquy may be aimed at the construction of the court of errors in this state, there are features in its constitution which elevates it most honorably, in comparison with that of the house of lords. At least 21 members must bo present at the hearing and decision of every case in the court of errors, and those members alone who hear the argument take part in the decision; and it is doubted whether any period can be referred to in the history of these two exalted tribunals; since they have had co-existence, in which the professional learning and experience in the New York court of errors was not at least equal in amount to that contained in the English house of lords. The decisions of the court of errors are, within the state of New York, obligatory to the same extent as enactments by positive law. It no more.diminishes-their efficiency that the judgment of one court may be modified or varied by that of its successor, than the vitality of a statute is impaired because it is liable to repeal at the will of the legislature. Such judgments are absolute rules of decision in all cases to which they apply in the state tribunals, (Hanford v. Artcher, 4 Hill, 271; Butler v. Van Wyck, 1 Hill, 438;) and although, within the doctrines declared by the supreme court in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 19, they are not laws, in a technical sense, and as such obligator}'' upon this court, still, on the inquiry as to what the law of the state is, such decisions must supply evidence of great weight and cogency. Indeed, what particulars can be regarded as in principle more local or intraterritorial than those which pertain to'the domestic institutions of a state, \u2014 the social and domestic relations of its citizens, \u2014 or what could probably be less within the meaning of congress, than that, in regard to these interesting matters, the courts of the United States should be empowered to introduce rules and principles, because found in the ancient common law, which should extinguish or supersede the policy and cherished usages of a state, authenticated and sanctified as part of her laws by the judgments of her highest tribunals?\n. In my opinion, the'rule indicated by the supreme court in Swift v. Tyson, if not limited strictly to questions of commerical law, does not embrace the present case, and that the adjudications of the court of errors, prescribing the laws of its citizens in respect to the custody of infant children, resident in the state, and the relative rights of parents in respect to such children, are rules of decision in this court in all common-law cases touching these questions. But, if not so, and the United States court is to act independently of all control by the decisions of the local courts, and is to determine for itself what the common-law rule is in relation to such matters, the judgment of the local tribunal cannot but be of most imposing weight and significancy as a matter of evidence. I do pot discover that that judgment stands opposed to any authentic evidence of the common-law rule as it existed in England anterior to our Revolution, or which has ever existed in this state; and, if even a doubt might be raised on that point, the inclination of this court, most assuredly, must be to yield to the domestic, and not to the foreign, interpretation of the rule. If it be conceded that the more recent decisions in England establish the law of that country now to be as claimed by the petitioner, they supply no authority here, further than they correspond with the law as clearly existing antecedent to 1775. I am not aware the doctrine has ever been countenanced in the supreme court of the United States that modern decisions in the English courts, unsanctioned by ancient tradition, are entitled to outweigh those of state courts in fixing the final laws of the state. The value of the latest decision, the most relied on, that of King v. Greenhill, 4 Adol. & E. 624, when brought in competition with those of the American courts, upon an inquiry into the reason of the law, is essentially impaired by the declaration of Lord Dunman in the house of lords, (the judge who pronounced the decision below,) that he was ashamed of the necessity which exacted a decision of that character from a British court, and of a late lord chancellor, on the same occasion, that the rule of law announced by that decision was a disgrace to the English character. But T do not feel that it is imposed on this court to revise the subject at large, and determine what is the true rule of the common law in this respect. The United States court in no way acts in supervision of the state courts. The decisions of these tribunals are independent of the United States judiciary, and absolute in themselves, in all cases not subject to review in the method pointed out by the judiciary acts. Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch, 96, 97. This case is not in that predicament. The extent of the authority of this court, on the principle of its organization, is no more than to act concurrently with the state court upon the subject-matter of this petition. If that concurrence does not import and exact an entire coincidence: if each tribunal acting within its sphere may examine and declare for itself, independently of the other, what rule of law shall govern the decisions, \u2014 that comity at least due between co-ordinate courts, if not that intimate and special relation of both to a common source and standard of law, would demand that neither should rigorously insist upon a principle which would bring it in collision with the other; the more especially that the United States courts should avoid, upon a balanced question, adopting conclusions which, carried into execution, must violate the domestic policy of the state, settled by the most solemn adjudications of its own judiciary. The alienage of the petitioner would not vary this principle, even if it be conceded that, by the laws of his domicile, he is entitled as absolutely to the custody of his infant children as to that of his estate. \"No interest, not even one resting in contract, is enforced by a court when it is repugnant to the laws or policy of the place where the action is prosecuted. Pearsall v. Dwight, 2 Mass. 89; Bank v. Porter, 5 Day, 320; Bank v. Earle, 13 Pet. 589. It by no means is an indisputable doctrine of public law, or of the law of this country, that the father of this infant can have here the same legal rights and dominion over it as if horn within the country of his allegiance; for, if so, it might impart to him a power abhorrent to the civilization and Christianity of our age, giving him a dominion no less absolute than one over his chattels, animate or inanimate. I do not, however, go into this topic, nor regard it as having any important bearing upon tlio decision now made. I apprehend it has been sufficiently shown that neither in England, before our Revolution, nor in this state since, has judgment been rendered under a habeas corpus in regard to infants, on the acceptation that the right of the father to their custody was anything in the nature of property, or so fixed in law as to afford a controlling rule of decision to the court. In the use .of the remedy afforded by means of this writ the courts have regarded the father as that guardian first to be looked to, in case a change of custody should be deemed proper, and the infant was not of competent age to make its own choice of guardian; but it has been purely in the apjfiication of the remedy, and for the protection and interest of the infant, and not in subordination to the legal right of the father, that such award is ever made. Nothing is clearer in international law than that a party prosecuting upon the clearest right, under the laws of his country, must still take his remedy in accordance with the law of the court he invokes, without regard to the law of his allegiance, and that his demand of this particular relief is no wajr aided by the consideration that it would be awarded him in England or Nova Scotia.\nI close this protracted discussion by saying that I deny the writ of habeas corpus prayed for because (1) if granted, and a return was made admitting the facts stated in the petition, I should discharge the infant on the ground that this court cannot exercise the common-law function of parens patrise, and has no common-law jurisdiction over the matter; (2) because the court has not judicial cognizance of the matter by virtue of any statute of the United States; or (3) if such jurisdiction is to be implied, that then the decisions of the court of errors of New York supplies the rule of law, or furnishes the highest evidence of the common-law rule, which is to be the rule of decision in the case; and (4) because by that rule the father is not entitled, on the case made by this petitioner, to take this child out of the custody of its mother. Petition denied."},{"case_name":"Hughlett vs. Hughlett et als.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/8543627\/","date":"1844-12-01","court":"Tennessee Supreme Court","content":"Turley, J.\ndelivered the following opinion of the court.\nOn the 12th day of January, 1827, Wm. T. Hughlett made and published his last will and testament, 'by which (after specific legacies) he disposes of the residuum of his estate in the following manner: \u201cAll the balance of my estate,'both real and persona], of every kind and description whatsoever, and all debts, dues and equities of what kind soever, that is not already disposed of, I will and require that my executors should lake and convert into money immediately, to the best advantage, and thereupon to pay and discharge all just demands that may hereafter arise against me; and after that is done, to pay to the legatees their distributive shares equally. And should it so happen, that any of the legatees, who have already received real or.personal estate bequeathed to them, should lose the same by older or interfering claims; then my executors are to make the deficiency good to them out of the funds of the real andpersonal estate above required to be sold, if there is enough so to do.\u201d\nThis will was proven at the April sessions of the County Court of Hickman, 1827, by Thomas D. Porter and William H. Hughlett, the executors, who entered into bond, with Joel Walker and John S. Russwurm, to the Governor of the State for the time being, conditioned' as follows:\n\u201cThe condition of the above obligation is such, that whereas the above bounden Thomas D. Porter and Wm. H. Hughlett, being appointed executors of the last will and testament of Wm. T. PTughlett, deceased, and now qualified as such according to law, do make or cause to be made a true and perfect inventory of all and singular the goods and chattels, rights and credits of the deceased, which have or shall come to the hands, knowledge or possession of the said Thomas D. Porter and Wm. H. Hughlett, or into the hands or possession of any person or persons for them, and the same so made, do exhibit on oath to the court of the county aforesaid within ninety days from the date of these presents; and the same goods and chattels, rights and credits of the deceased, at the time of his death, or which at any time hereafter, shall come into the hands or possession of the said Thomas D. Porter and Wm. H. Hughlett, or into the hands or possession of any person or persons for them, do well and truly administer according to law, and surrender up such legacies to the persons to whom they are bequeathed agreeably to the last will and testament of the deceased, and further do make, or cause to be made, a true and just account of said administration within two years after the date of these presents, and all the rest and residue of said estate, which shall be found remaining upon said executors\u2019 account, the same having been first examined and allowed by the court of said county, shall deliver and pay unto such person or persons respectively to which the same shall be due agreeably to the act of assembly in such cases made and provided, then this obligation to be void and of no effect, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d\nThomas D. Porter and William H. Hughlett, the executors, having thus proven the last will and entered into bond, proceeded to administer the estate, and to perform the trust imposed upon them; a joint inventory was returned by them on the 9th of April, 132*7, which specifies as the property of the estate, one thousand acres of land in Hardeman county, Tennessee, six hundred and forty acres of land in Hardeman county, Tennessee, out of which the locator is to have four hundred acres, five hundred acres of land in Obion county, Tennessee, one note on Elias Jones, Jr., $5 62\u00a3, Wm. Chelton\u2019s receipt for notes for collection, $57 62\u00bf. They continued thp joint performance of the duty they had thus taken upon themselves, till some.time in the autumn of the year 1837, when Thomas D. Porter died. During this period, all the lands of the estate, or the greater part of them, were sold by them under the provisions of the will, and the money received by one or both. Nothing appears to have been done by the surviving executor afterwards.\nOn the 19th of September, 1839, this bill was filed by John Hughlett, one of the legatees and devisees under the will, against Wm. H. Hughlett, the surviving executor, the executors of Thomas D. Porter, deceased, and the other legatees and devisees, seeking an account of the administration of the estate, and the execution ofthe trust under the will of Wm. T. Hughlett, deceased, against the executors and their sureties.\nThe most difficult and important questions presented for the consideration of the court, are questions of law, arising out of the construction of the liabilities of -the executors, as administrators of the personal estate of the deceased, and as trustees for the sale and distribution of his real estate, under the will, and the consequent liability of their sureties thereon.\nIt is contended for the sureties: 1st. That as the bond of the executors is joint, they are to be held jointly responsible for each other, for any liability arising under it, and are to be charged as principals, responsible each for each to the sureties, and that as long as either of them are able to make good any defalcation, for which they are liable under the bond, he shall be so held in preference to the sureties.\nThis proposition is too plain to admit of dispute. The exe-cutory might have given separate bonds, and thereby have been held separately liable. But this they have not done, but have chosen to enter into a joint bond, and the necessary consequence is, that the sureties are bound for them jointly and not individually and separately.\nIt is contended for the sureties, that they are not bound under the bond for the performance of the trust reposed in the executors to sell the lands of the testator, and appropriate the proceeds to the payment of his debts, and to the legateeju^g der the will.\n' . This is a much graver question, and one worthy <|f ation. It may be reduced to this simple proposition!: sureties of an executor responsible for the proceea\/J devised to be sold by him? The solution of this qif pends upon the nature of his duties and re'sponsibili?\u00edfe\u00bf under such a devise, and how and where he is tobe held accotmtUT for their performance.\nIn order to arrive at a correct understanding upon this subject, it will become necessary to enquire; 1st. How it is adjudged by the common law. And 2d. What changes, if any, have been effected in relation thereto by statutory provisions of the State of Tennessee.\nThe duties of an executor and administrator, in relation to the administration of goods and chattels, rights and credits, are the same, with the exception, that administrators, after the payment of debts, are bound to distribute the surplus, according to the statutes of distribution; but the executors must pay specific legacies, in addition to debts, before distribution. An executor, as such, has no more right to interfere with the real estate of his testator, than has the administrator with that of his intestate, unless he be authorized so to do, by express power delegated to him in the will. An executor .then may act in a double capacity, viz, as administrator of the personalty, and as trustee executing a power. It is then necessary in this branch o'f the subject, to treat of his duties and responsibilities in both these capacities.\nIn ancient times, if a man died without making any disposition of his goods and chattels, the King as parens patriae seized them, to the intent, that they should be preserved and disposed of for the burial of the deceased, the payment of his debts, to advance his wife and children, if he had any, if not, those of his blood. Afterwards the Crown, in favor of the Church, invested the Prelates with this branch of the prerogative; for it was said, none could be found more fit to have such care or charge of the transitory goods of the deceased, than the Ordinary, who all his life had the care and charge of his soul. This trust was abused by the Ordinary, who under the name of pious uses, took the whole residuum of the deceased\u2019s estate, after the paries raiionahiles of the wife and children had been deducted, without paying the lawful debts and charges thereon. This produced the statute of West. 2d, 13th, Ed. 1st, ch. 19, which enacted, that the Ordinary should pay the debts of the intestate, so far as his goods extended, in the same manner that executors were bound, in case the deceased had left a will. Yet the residuum, after the payment of his debts, remained still in his hands, to be applied to whatever purpose his conscience should approve. The flagrant abuses of this power produced the passage of the statute of 31st, Ed. 3d, sec. 1, ch. 11, which provides, that \u201cin case where a man dies intestate, the Ordinary shall depute the next and most lawful friends of the dead person, intestate, to administer his goods, which deputies shall have an action to demand and receive, as executors, the debts due to the said person-intestate in the King\u2019s Court, for to administer and dispend for the soul of the dead; and shall answer, also, in the King\u2019s Court, to others to whom the said dead person was holden and bound, in the sanie manner as executors shall answer;' and they shall be accountable to the Ordinaries as executors are in the case of a testament, as well of the time past, as the time to come.\u201d 1st Wil. Ex\u2019rs. 236.\nThis is the origin of administrators, as they are at present in England. They are officers of the Ordinary, appointed by him in pursuance of the statute, and their title and authority are derived exclusively from the Ecclesiastical Judge, by grants, denominated letters of administration.\nThis was doing much to secure a correct administration of the effects of deceased intestates. But something still remained to be done to make the security effectual; the administrator might waste the effects, and be unable to answer personally for them. This defect was remedied by the statutes of 21st Henry 8th, ch. 5, sec. 2, and 12th and 23d Charles 2d, ch. 10, sec. 1.\nThe statute of Henry directs the Ordinary to grant administration, taking security of him or them, to whom shall be made such commission. That of Charles, further provides, that \u201call Ordinaries, as well as Judges of the Prerogative Courts of Canterbury and York, as all other Ordinaries and Ecclesiastical Judges, having power to commit administration of the goods of persons dying intestate, shall and may, upon their respective granting and committing of administration of the goods of persons dying intestate after the 1st day of June, 1671, of the respective person or persons to whom any administration is to be committed, take sufficient bonds, with two or more able sureties, respect being had to the value of the estate, in the name of the Ordinary, with the condition in form and manner following, mutatis mutandis, viz,\n\u201cThe condition of the above obligation is such, that if the within bounden A B, administrator of all and singular, the goods, chattels and credits of C D, deceased, do make, or cause to be made, a true and perfect inventory of all and singular, the goods, chattels and credits of said deceased, which .have or shall come to the hands, possession or knowledge of him the said A B, or into the hands or possession of any other person or persons for him, and the same so made, do exhibit, or cause to be exhibited in the registry of-- court, at or before the -day next ensuing, and the same goods, chattels and credits of tbr \u2022 id deceased, at the time of his death, which at any tim \u2022 . ' .or shall come to the hands or possession of the said AT- . mto the hands and possession of any other person or persons for him, do well and truly administer according to law: And further, do make, or cause to be made, a true and just account of his said administration, at or before the - day of -, and all the rest and residue of the said goods, chattels and credits, which shall be found remaining upon said administrator\u2019s account, the same being first examined and allowed by the Judge or Judges, for the time being, of the said court, shall deliver and pay unto said person or persons respectively, as the said Judge or Judges by his or their decree or sentence, pursuant to the true interest and meaning of this act, shall limit and appoint. And if it shall hereafter appear, that any last will and testament was made by the said deceased, and the executor or executors therein named, do exhibit the same into the said court, making request to have it allowed and approved accordingly, if the said A B, within bounden, being thereunto i*equired, do render and deliver the said letters of administration (approbation of said testament being first had and made) in the said court, then this obligation to be void and of none effect, or else to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d\nSuch is the condition of the bonds of administrators in England at this day, and such is substantially also in this State.\nBut the Ecclesiastical Courts in England, to which the jurisdiction of the probate of wills also belonged, never had authority to require of an executor a bond for the due administration of the assets, 4th Burns Ecclesiastical Law, 176, but had the power at the common law to demand a bond from administrators with the will annexed, as well as administrators in cases of intestacy, with a condition to exhibit an inventory, and to administer truly, by paying debts and legacies, as appears from the case Folks vs. Dominique, 2d Strange, 1137, where it was adjudged, that a bond given durante minore estate, with the will annexed, upon such condition, though not coming within the statute of 21st Henry 8th, was good at the common law, as to the payment of legacies, that being a subject of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction. This statute of Henry 8th, only provides, in addition to cases of intestacy, that in case of an executor refusing to prove the will, the Ordinary shall take from him, to whom the administration is granted, security for.the true administra tion of the goods, chattels and debts. 4th Burns\u2019 Ecclesiastical Law, 204.\nThe duties of an executor and of an administrator, with the will annexed, are identically the same in respect to rendering an inventory and account to the Ordinary, and as to the payment of debts and legacies. Toller\u2019s Law of Executors, 490. The engagements of the one and the other are the same, the executor being bound by his oath and the duty of his office, and the administrator, with .the will annexed, in addition to these obligations, by his bond. The oath of an executor as given by Toller, in his Law of Executors, 58, is, \u201cthat he will truly perform the will, by paying first, his testator\u2019s debts, and then the legacies therein contained, as far as the goods, chattels and credits will extend, and the law charges him, and that he will make a true and perfect inventory of all the goods, chattels and credits, and exhibit the same in the registry of the Spiritual court, and render a just account thereof when lawfully required.\u201d\n\u25a0This all shows, that so far as the Ecclesiastical Courts were concerned, the duties of executors, administrators of intestates, and administrators with the will annexed, were the same, being confined to the disposition of the goods,-chattels and credits of their testator or intestate; the distribution of effects of the one being under the will, and of the other under the statutes of distribution: and the great and material difference between them is, that it is the duty of the court to take a bond from administrators, and that it has no power to exact one from executors. And the reason of this difference is obvious. In the case of wills, the testator appoints the executor; he is supposed to have full knowledge of his capacity for performing the duties of his office, and full confidence in him, and, therefore, there is no necessity for the Ordinary to require a bond\u2014 but not so in the case of administrators; there is no confidence reposed in them by the intestate; they are appointed by the Ordinary, who may have but little if any acquaintance with their fitness or responsibility for the office, and a bond with satisfactory security becomes necessary for the safety of the estate.\nThe Ordinary having no power to exact a bond from an executor, if he attempt to do so, a writ of prohibition may be had, and if the bond be taken it is void. Lev. 233.\nThe Ecclesiastical Courts, then, having no power to exact or receive a bond from an executor for the payment of debts or .legacies arising out of personal estate, or the distribution of the residue of goods, chattels and credits, things peculiarly within their jurisdiction, it will follow a fortiori, that they have no power so to do, in cases excluded from their jurisdiction. This brings us to the second branch of the proposition under consideration; that is, what are the duties and responsibilities of an executor in executing a devise to sell real estate, and appropriate the proceeds either in the payment of debts or legacies.\nThis is a question of authority. In 14 Viner, 468, pl. 14, it is laid down, that \u201cthe proceeds of land given by the testator for the payment of debts and legacies, are not testamentary, and the executors are not bound to put such proceeds into the inventory. The Ecclesiastical Courts never had jurisdiction to enforce the payment of legacies out of the proceeds of land devised to be sold, that not being a testamentary subject.\u201d Dyer, 151: Palm. 120: 2 Show. 50, pl. 36: Hob. 265. It was a mere trust, which at all times could only be enforced in a Court of Equity.\nIn the case of Clay et als, adm'rs, debonis non, vs. R. Willis, surviving ex'r, 8 Com. Law Rep. 103, it was held by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, composed of Bayley, Holroyd and Best, that a devise of an equitable interest in land for the payment of debts, constituted the proceeds equitable assets, because the devise was in trust to pay debts. Bayley, Judge, said, upon this point: Lewen vs. Oakly, 2 Atkins 50, is precisely in point; that was followed by Silk vs. Prime, 1st Brown Cha. Ca. 138, in which all the cases were carefully considered, and Newton vs. Binnel, 1st Brown\u2019s C. C. 134, to the same effect. And these cases have been since confirmed by Lord Chancellor Eldon, in Bailey vs. Eakins, 7 Vesey, 319, and Sheppard vs. Luwidge, 8 Vesey, 26. Upon these authorities and others referred to, the whole court declared themselves satisfied, that the assets sought to be recovered, were equitable and not legal, a. \u2019 ''w-suited the plaintiff. In the case of Baker, ex\u2019r, vs. Charles May and others, 17 Com. Law Rep. 426, a testator devised to his executors, their heirs and assigns, his lands upon trust, to sell the same, and directed that the money arising from the sale should be deemed part of his personal estate, and that it should be subject to the disposition made concerning his personal estate. He then directed his personal estate to be sold, and when the money arising from the sale of his personal and real estate should be collected, he disposed of it in the manner mentioned in the will, and among other dispositions, he bequeathed a legacy to A B: it was held.by tbe Court of King\u2019s Bench, Lord Tenterden Ch. J., that the money arising from the sale of the real estate was equitable assets, and that the legatee could not maintain a suit in the Ecclesiastical Court to recover his legacy.\nMr. Williams in his Treatise upon Executors, p. 1033, says: \u201cHitherto the subject has been confined to the consideration of assets, such as may be reached at law, and such as a creditor, suing the executor in an action at law for a debt due from the testator, might bring forward in evidence to disprove the executor\u2019s plea of plane admin\u00edstrame. But there are besides various, interests frequently forming part of the estate of an executor or administrator, which are not recognized as assets at law, and which, therefore, if administered at all, must be administered in equity. This latter portion of the estate in the hands of the executor or administrator is called equitable assets, in contradistinction to the former, which is called legal assets. In other words, legal assets are such as are liable to debts in the temporal courts, an\u2019d legacies in the spiritual, by the course pf law. Equitable assets are such' as are liable only by the help of a Court of Equity.\u201d Many other authorities to the same point, might be adduced, but these are amply sufficient to establish the propositions; that the lands devised to be sold for the payment of debts or legacies, are not administrate as legal assets; that the executor acts in relation to them as trustee, an'-\u2019 notas executor of personal effects; that no suit can be br vg\u00fct at law in relation thereto, nor in the Ecclesiastical Courts; that they are equitable assets, cognizable only in a Court of Chancery; that the executor is not bound to return them in his inventory to the Court of Ordinary; that neither the oath of an executor, nor the oath and bond of an administrator, with the will annexed, extends to them, but are confined exclusively to those duties which devolve upon them purely in the character of executor or administrator, and which the Ordinary had the right to exact the performance of.\nThis brings us to the discussion of the 2d general proposition in relation to the subject under consideration, viz, what changes, if any, have been effected upon this subject, by the statutory provisions of the State of Tennessee?\nHaving no Ecclesiastical Courts in our country, it became necessary at an early period to appoint some other tribunal for the probate of wills, and the granting of letters of administration upon intestate estates. Accordingly it was enacted in the Colony of North Carolina in 1715, ch. 48, sec. 4 and 5, that no person shall enter upon the administration of any deceased person\u2019s estate until he has obtained letters of administration, or letters testamentary, under the penalty of one hundred and twenty-five dollars; and that the Clerk of the County Court shall not sign and issue any letters testamentary without taking the executor\u2019s oath for the performance of the will of the deceased, or letters of administration, without the administrator has taken the oath of the administrator, and also has given sufficient bond, with two or more able sureties, taken before the County Court, respect being had to the value of the estate, in the name of the Governor, for the time being, with the condition in the form and manner following, to be changed as the case may be. This condition, which it is unnecessary here tQ quote, is strictly in substance, and almost in form the same with that given by the statute of 22d and 23d of Charles the 2d, ch. 10, sec. 1, which we have already quoted verbatim. This statute of 1715, only changes the forum, and leaves the duties and responsibilities of executors and administrators precisely as they were after the passage of the statute of Charles. Various other statutes were enacted between that period and 1813, relating exclusively to the mode of administering and distributing the estates of deceased persons; but having noth ing to do with the enlargement or creation of new sureties for the faithful performance of their duties by executors or administrators.\nAn act was passed in 1813, chap. 11, which provides that \u201call executors of every description shall, before they presume to enter upon the administration of any estate whatsoever, enter into bond and security in the same way that administrators are required to do, unless the testator shall otherwise expressly provide by his will, in which case no bond or surety shall be required, unless thereafter some creditor or creditors, or the representative or representatives of such testator shall apply to the court of the county, and suggest by petition that said executor or executors are wasting, or liltely to waste the estate of his.or their testator; whereupon it shall be lawful for such court, and they are hereby required to direct said executor or executors, on satisfactory proof being made to said court of the truth of said complaint, and proof also being made that ten days notice in writing has been given to said executor or executors, to enter into bond and security as other executors are by this act required to do; and in case said executor or executors shall fail to enter into bond with satisfactory security within three days after said order is made, said court shall proceed to appoint an administrator for said -estate, who shall forthwith proceed to call said executor or executors to account for said estate, who shall give bond and security and be qualified as other administrators are required by law, and shall dispose of said estate agreeably to the last will and testament of such deceased.\u201d\nThis is the first and last act requiring executors to give bond and security: how is it to be construed?\nWe have seen that where a testator devises personalty for the payment of debts and legacies, and also lands to be sold by his executors for the same purposes, the executor acts .in a double capacity, viz, as administrator of the personal property and as trustee for the execution of powers under the will; that the assets in the one case are legal, recoverable by the debtors of the testator in a court of law and by the legatees in the ecclesiastical courts; that in the other they are equitable, and can only be reached in a court of chancery. This principle has been in no wise changed in this State by legislative enactment; the only difference which, exists here in relation to the subject arising out of the fact that we have no ecclesiastical court, and therefore a legatee of personalty, if the executor do not assent to the legacy, is driven to pursue his remedy in a court of chancery, as well as a legatee of money arising from, the sale of land devised to be so sold by the executor.\nNow the question is, when the legislature provided by the act of 1813 that executors should give bond, was it meant that they should give bond as the executors of the personalty, which constitutes legal assets only, or for that and the performance of the trust in relation to the laws created by the will also? We think there can be but little difficulty in saying that it is confined exclusively to the former.\nThe statute says, \u201cAll executors\u201d \u2014 the word executors is a technical term, and applies to duties to be performed in relation to the goods and chattels, rights and credits of the testator, in contradistinction to that of trustee, which applies to duties to be performed in relation to real estate \u2014 \u201cshall enter into bond and security in the same way that administrators are required to do.\u201d We have seen in what way administrators were required by the act of 1715 to enter into bond and security, and that it is the same that is required by the act of 22nd and 23rd of Charles the Second; that is, a bond for the performance of duties in relation to personal property alone, \u201cunless the testator shall otherwise direct; in which case no bond or security shall be required, unless upon a suggestion that the executor is wasting or likely to waste the estate.\u201d Waste, or a devastavit as it is called, is a common law term, applicable only to legal assets, and therefore induces the belief that legal assets only were in the contemplation of the'legislature. \u201cAnd in case said executor or executors shall fail to enter into bond, with satisfactory security, said court shall proceed to appoint an administrator for said estate, who shall forthwith call said executor to account for said estate.\u201d How is it possible for the administrator thus appointed to call the executor to account for acts .--e by him in relation thereto, not as executor, but as a trustee w.\/ ' \u2019 ^ will? How is it possible for an administrator thus appointed, to execute the trust, which is of a personal and confidential character, unless he be authorized by express enactment so to do? It must of necessity be, that the only things for which the executor can be called upon thus to account is in relation to the personalty. \u201cAnd the administrator thus appointed shall give-bond and security, and be qualified as other administrators;\u201d not as executors, if executors be required by the statute to give bond for the performance of the trust imposed upon them by the will, but as other administrators, for the personalty-only.\nWe then have the strange anomaly of an executor being removed because he has not given security for the performance of the trust, and an administrator appointed to execute it, who has likewise given no security \u2014 an absurdity too glaring to be entertained for a moment.\nWe therefore hold, that an executor in the State of Tennessee is only bound to give security as administrators are, for the faithful performance of his duty in administering the legal effects of his testator\u2019s estate; that the county court has no more power to exact from him a bond for the discharge of his duties as a trustee in selling and disposing of lands under the will, than the ecclesiastical court in England had, and that any bond taken for that purpose is to all intents and purposes null and void. It follows, that if the .sureties of the executors in the case now under consideration have, by the terms of their bond, (which we do not so consider,) made themselves responsible for ths execution of the trust of the will in relation to the real estate devised to be sold, it has created no legal obligation upon them and they are not bound by it, but are discharged therefrom both in law and equity.\nIt follows also, as a corollary, that there is no mutual liability created by the bond, as between executors in relation to the trust. But it is contended on behalf of those interested in the execution of the trust, that from its nature and the extent to which it has been partly executed, the executors are mutually1 responsible for its completion; or, in other words, that inasmuch as the executors have joined in the sale of the real, estate devised to them to be sold under the trust in the will, they are mutually bound to see that the money, when collected, shall be paid to those entitled to it under the will, and of this opinion is the court.\nThe question came up for consideration in the case of Deaderick et als. vs. Cantrell et als. 10 Yerg. 264. That was a case of lands devised to be sold by his executor, and the proceeds bequeathed to different persons, payable as they should arrive respectively at the age of twenty-one years, and directing the executors in the meantime to loan out the money to the best advantage. The lands were sold, and the money collected by one of the executors, and he, instead of loaning it out as directed, appropriated it to his own use. Upon a bill to charge his co-executor for the breach of trust, this court,- among other things applicable to the case, but not to this, said: \u201cIt is admitted in the case under consideration, that the money was not jointly received, and that no joint receipt was executed: but it is contended, that the money was paid to Cantrell the executor, who consumed the fund, by the act, direction or \u00e1greement of Wharton his co-executor, and under such circumstances as must make him liable for its waste; and, we think, succes-fully.\nThis is not like ordinary case of a fund outstanding, which has to be received by trustees; but is a case in which property was devised to them to be sold, the notes for which were taken payable to both trustees. Upon the payment of the money, no receipts were necessary; the notes were taken up by the makers, and being in the name of both, it seems to us to constitute as strong, if not a stronger case, than that of a joint receipt.\nWe do not hesitate to say, that the notes could not have come exclusively into the hands of Cantrell, and the money been collected on them by him without the act, direction and agreement of Wharton;\u201d and the court, upon that ground as well as others, held Wharton responsible for the maladministration of his co-executor Cantrell.\nSo in the case now under consideration, the lands were de vised to be sold by the executors upon the best advantage; no terms of sale are specified, no time fixed at which the trust is to be completed by the payment of the money to those entitled to receive it; but these matters are left entirely to the discretion of the executors. They proved the will, undertook the execu. tion of the trust, sold the land \u2014 this they were compelled by law to do jointly, and it follows, of course, if money were received in payment, it must have been received jointly; if notes, they must have been executed to them jointly, and the payment could not have been received by one individually, without the act, direction and agreement of-tne other. In either case, an abuse of the trust by one, makes the other responsible to the cestui qwe trust, upon the principles as laid down in the case of Deaderick and others against Cantrell and others.\nUpon the whole view of this case, then, we hold that the executors are jointly responsible for .the performance of the trust, and for any abuses that may have arisen in the progress of its execution; that they are jointly responsible by the bond for any maladministration of the personal estate of their testator in the payment of legacies under the will, or in making distribution of any portion of it that may not have been specifically bequeathed, and that the securities in the bond are responsible for them thus far and no farther; and we decree accordingly."},{"case_name":"M'Cord, Executor, v. Ochiltree and Others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1380910\/","date":"1846-05-26","court":"Supreme Court of Indiana","content":"Dewey, J.\nIn 1830, \u201c the synod of the state of Indiana of the Presbyterian Church, whose standard of faith is the Westminster Confession,\u201d established a Theological Seminary at South-Hanover; and by a compact with the trustees of the academy located there, which possessed corporate powers, made the seminary the theological department of that institution. In 1834, the academy having received collegiate powers by an act of the legislature, the connexion was dissolved, and a similar connexion formed with the college, there being an understanding between the parties that the synods of other states should have the privilege of joining the synod of Indiana. All the operations of the Theological Seminary were to be \u201c conducted on the principle of a strict adherence to the standard of the Presbyterian Church in its obvious meaning.\u201d In 1840, the synod, with the consent of the college, removed the Theological Seminary to New Albany, and in 1842, the latter was incorporated under the name of \u201cThe Trustees of the New Albany Theological Seminary.\u201d From its first establishment at South-Hanover until its incorporation, the seminary was always organized, and regularly conducted under the management of directors appointed for that purpose. In 1839, John Ochiltree made his last will and testament, and died in 1840. Among other bequests he made the following: \u201cAfter paying all the foregoing bequests, I give and bequeath unto the Theological Seminary at South-Hanover, in the state of Indiana, all the remainder of my estate, to continue a permanent fund, and the interest to be applied to the education of pious, indigent youths who are preparing themselves for the ministry of the Gospel, and those only who strictly adhere to the Westminster confession of faith in its literal meaning.\u201d\nThe estate of the testator consisted of personal property and choses in action, all of which the executors were directed to convert into money, and to pay the proceeds to the several legatees. The only executor who proved the will and took letters testamentary was Robert M\u2018Gord. The heirs at law of the testator are George M. Ochiltree, John Ochiltree, and James Ochiltree. These heirs demanded the above stated legacy of the executor, who refused to pay it to them, on the ground, that the trustees of the New Albany seminary claimed the right to hold the same in trust for the purpose expressed in the will. The heirs then brought this bill in equity making M\u2018Gord the only defendant. They claim the legacy as being void at law.\nThe above facts appear from the bill, answer, and exhibits. The Circuit Court decreed in favour of the complainants.\nThe legacy in controversy is void at law, because the objects of the testator\u2019s benevolence \u2014 pious, indigent youths preparing for the ministry of the Gospel according to a particular standard of faith \u2014 are too vaguely indicated to enable them to take the legacy without the interposition of a trustee ; and because there was, at the death of the testator, no existing trustee capable of executing the trust intended to be created by the will. The Theological Seminary, being at that time an unincorporated society, could not execute a trust of that character, being the application of a permanent fund to a particular purpose, for the want of succession. The Baptist Association v. Hart's Executors, 4 Wheat. 1. See, also, Anon. 1 Ch. Cas. 207.\u2014 Case of Christ's College, 1 W. Blacks. 90. \u2014 Collison's Case, Hob. 136.\u2014 Widmore v. Woodroffe, Amb. 636. \u2014 Com. Dig. Devise, K. \u2014 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 396, 397.\nThe English Court of Chancery, however, as we shall show, would give effect to such a legacy as a charitable trust. But it is contended in behalf of the complainants, that our Courts of equity do not, and cannot constitutionally, possess' jurisdiction adequate to effect that purpose.\nThe jurisdiction of the English Court of Chancery has several branches, and is derived from various sources. The most important branch of its power is that general one which it exercises as a Court of,equity, in common with the Court of Exchequer; but besides this extensive equity jurisdiction, it has other powers which are peculiar to itself. Of these powers it will be necessary, on the present occasion, to notice but one \u2014 that which is delegated to it by the crown, as parens patriae. Within this branch of its jurisdiction is classed the superintendence of infants, idiots, lunatics, and certain charities. 3 Blacks. Comm. 427. \u2014-2 Fonb. Eq. 205. \u2014 Cary v. Bertie, 2 Vern. 333.\u2014 Cooper\u2019s Eq. Int. 27. This is the branch of chancery jurisdiction which it is contended our Courts of equity do not possess.\nThe whole judicial power of this state, \u201c both as to matters of law and equity,\" is \u201c vested in one Supreme Court, in Circuit Courts, and in such other inferior Courts as the general assembly may, from time to time, direct and establish.\u201d Const, art. 5, sect. 1. By the second section of the same article, the Supreme Court is to have appellate jurisdiction only, except \u201cin capital cases, and cases in chancery, where the president of the Circuit Court may be interested,\u201d &c. The third section confers original common law and chancery jurisdiction on the Circuit Courts.\nIt is evident that the framers of the constitution used the words equity and chancery as convertible terms. No inference, ^therefore, as to the extent of the jurisdiction meant to be conferred upon our Courts,, can be inferred from the use of the one or the other; and we must look to other considerations to guide us to the true construction of the constitution in this respect.\n' In 1807, the judiciary power of the Indiana territory was _ vested in a General Court, a Court of Chancery, Courts of Common Pleas, and in justices of the peace, the latter having a limited criminal jurisdiction. The General Court, sitting in bank, was a Court of Errors; its judges were required to hold nisi prius Courts on the circuits.. This Court and its judges on the circuits possessed a common law jurisdiction in criminal and civil cases. The Court of Chancery \u201c exercised all the powers usually exercised by Courts of equity.\u201d The Courts of Common Pleas, in addition to a common law jurisdiction, were clothed with the power of appointing guardians for infants, of ordering a sale of minors\u2019 estates in certain cases, and of settling guardians\u2019 accounts. In 1813, during the first session of the fourth territorial legislature, certain chancery powers were given to the Courts of Common Pleas, a mixed practice, partly common law and partly chancery, was prescribed in those Courts in the same cause; and the Court of Chancery was prospectively abolished. At the second session of the same legislature held in the same year, the Courts of Common Pleas, and the Circuit Courts held by the judges of the General Court, were abolished, the territory was divided into circuits, and one of the judges of the General Court, with two associates, was constituted a new Circuit Court in each county. To these new Courts was transferred all the jurisdiction of the old Circuit Courts, of the Courts of Common Pleas, and of the Court of Chancery. The next legislature, held in 1814, by one act created other Circuit Courts, by another act transferred to them the business pending before the Circuit Courts of the last year\u2019s creation, by a third act prescribed common law practice in these new Courts, and by a fourth act finally abolished the Court of Chancery, transferred its powers to the Circuit Courts, and prescribed therein also rules of chancery practice. Thus stood the system (if system it can be called) of the territorial judiciary in 1816, when the constitution was formed.\nThe counsel of the complainants argues that, from this state of things, fluctuating and imperfect as it was, the framers of the constitution had become familiar with the idea of a Court of Chancery exercising only the usual jurisdiction of a Court of equity, to the exclusion of a power similar to\nthat under which the English Court of Chancery enforces charities, and superintends and protects the persons, rights, and interests of infants, idiots, and lunatics; and that being thus impressed they authorized the establishment of Courts of Chancery, with only the restricted jurisdiction. We cannot think so. The legislature is certainly competent to confer the extended jurisdiction upon either the common law or chancery side of our Courts. The superintendence of infants, idiots, lunatics, and charities must abide somewhere. If the position assumed in respect to the jurisdiction\/of our Courts of Chancery could be sustained, the consequence would be, that matters, belonging with peculiar propriety to them, must be committed to the cognizance of the common law Courts. We can see no rational cause, which could induce the makers of the constitution to compel the legislature thus to swell the common law jurisdiction, and to curtail that of chancery. And we apprehend that if the same limited construction of the constitution, which is contended for in regard to the jurisdiction of our Courts of Chancery, were to prevail both as to them and the common law Courts too, every law, passed since we became a state, for the protection of infants, idiots, and lunatics, by proceedings, in the Circuit Courts, would be unconstitutional and void. Those Courts possess by the constitution only common law and chancery'jurisdiction; and if the laws referred to cannot be supported under the latter head, they cannot be vindicated at all; they certainly are not referrible to the common law jurisdiction.\nBut there is another consideration, which we think has a strong bearing on this subject. As early as 1795, the North Western territory adopted the common law of England. That adoption continued through the whole of our territorial existence, and still continues. The prerogative of the English crown is a part of the common law. 1 Hale\u2019s Hist, of the C. L. 25. Undoubtedly, some branches of the royal prerogative are not adapted to our institutions, and have no existence among us. But no one will deny that the branch of it which enjoins upon the king, as parens patries, the duty of looking- after the welfare of those who, from tender age and imbecility of mind, are incapable of taking care of themselves, contains a principle necessary to the well being of any slate, whatever may be the form of its government. It is _ certainly no less applicable and beneficial to republics than to monarchies. This common law principle has been enforced in England, from time immemorial, by the Court of Chancery acting under its delegated jurisdiction from the king, as parens pairice, as distinguished from its ordinary general equity jurisdiction. There was not, when our constitution was adopted, nor is there even now, any statutory system, affording to infants, idiots, and lunatics that full and ample protection of their persons, their rights, their property, and to the morals of infants, which is to be found in the English Court of Chancery, when exercising this peculiar branch of its jurisdiction. The framers of our constitution cannot be supposed to have been ignorant of these matters; and knowing them, they could not, we think, have designed to exclude from our Courts of Chancery, the exercise of a jurisdiction so necessary and beneficial.\nOur construction, therefore, is, that the constitution does not forbid the establishment of Courts of Chancery with power, in addition to the usual jurisdiction of a Court of equity, of taking cognizance of and protecting the persons, rights, and property of infants, idiots, and lunatics, and of superintending and enforcing charities.\nThe first state legislature accordingly established our Circuit'Courts as they are now organized, and clothed them with \u201c original jurisdiction in all causes, matters, and things at law and in chancery.\u201d Laws of 1817, p. 16. These Courts, therefore, possess both the branches of chancery jurisdiction which we have been considering. This view of the subject vindicates the case of Peck et al. v. Braman, 2 Blackf. 141, in whieh this Court held that \u201cthe guardianship of minors, and the adjustment of their accounts, form a conspicuous braneh of chancery jurisdiction.\u201d\nIt is now well established (contrary to the opinions of distinguished chancellors and writers heretofore entertained), that the English Court of Chancery possesses an inherent jurisdiction which it has always exercised to enforce and effectuate charities, which at law were illegal or informal gifts. Vidal et al. v. Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 Howard, 127, and the authorities there cited. But since the passage of the statute of the 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, commonly called the statute of charitable uses, the decisions have been founded principally upon that act; and the jurisdiction has been considered as confined to the charities therein enumerated, or to those\u2019 which by analogy are within its spirit and intention. Attorney General v. Hewer, 2 Vernon, 387. \u2014 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 403. It may therefore be proper, though it is not absolutely necessary to the decision of this cause, to inquire whether that statute is in force in this state.\nIn addition to the common law, we have adopted \u201c all statutes or acts of the British parliament made in aid of the common law prior to the fourth year of the reign of king James the first, excepting the second section of the sixth chapter of forty-third Elizabeth, the eighth chapter, thirteenth Elizabeth, and ninth chapter, thirty-seventh Henry eighth, and which are of a general nature, not local to that kingdom, and not inconsistent with the laws of this state.\u201d R. S. 1843, p. 1030. The statute in question we conceive to be in aid of the common law, for though it gave no new jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery, it enumerated and specified subjects of its cognizance which, prior to its passage, seem to have been involved somewhat in doubt and obscurity. That our legislatures which, from time to time, have adopted, in nearly the same language, the English statutes in aid of the common law, meant to exclude this act we cannot believe. Their attention in making the adoptions was turned particularly to the statutes passed in the reign of Elizabeth, and although they were careful to exclude expressly some provisions of trifling import, they did not name as among the exceptions this important act (1). Had they designed not to adopt it, we think they would have said so. Nor are its provisions, with one or two exceptions, in their nature local to Great Britain, nor incompatible with the laws of this state. The uses enumerated by the act are gifts, &c., \u201cfor relief of aged, impotent, and poor people; for maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers and mariners, schools of learning, free schools, and scholars of universities; for repair of bridges, ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks, and highways; for education and preferment of orphans; for or towards the relief, stock, or maintenance of houses of correction; for mar riages of poor maids; for supportation, aid, and help of young tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons decayed, and others; for relief or redemption of prisoners or captives, and for aid or ease of any poor inhabitants; concerning payment of fifteens, setting out of soldiers, and other taxes.\u201d 1 Bac. Abr. 580. The act contains provisions by which gifts, &c., for the enumerated objects are to be executed agreeably to the intention of the donor, &c.\nWe have.several statutory incorporations, the objects of which are to promote literary and religious education; but we have no law, independently of the laws adopted from England, for the protection and.enforcement of charities designed to be bestowed in trust upon those institutions, but which, through some legal defect, cannot be enforced, except in a tribunal authorized to look to the will of the donor, instead of the formalities of the law. Such a statute as the one in question is needed by us. We think its principles, with the exception of one or two, have been adopted and are in force in this state. Nor is our policy singular in this respect. Several of the other states of the Union have also adopted that statute.\nThat the English Court of Chancery will sustain, as a charity, a gift void at law, is established by numerous decisions'. It will be necessary to quote but a few of them. In Attorney General v. Hickman, 2 Ch. Cas. Abr. 193, it was decided that a legacy to certain trustees, to be distributed in charity, though lapsed at law by the death of all the trustees in the life-time of the testator, was good as a charity. In Mills v. Farmer, 1 Mer. 55, the Court held that a bequest as a charity to such person as the executor should name, and no executor was appointed, was valid, and would be executed by the Court, assuming the office of executor. See, also, Moggridge v. Thackwell, 7 Ves. 36. So, it has been held that a devise of a sum of money charged upon real estate, \u201c to be applied to such charitable use as the testator had by writing under his hand formerly directed,\u201d and no such writing could be found, was good as a charity, and would be disposed of by the Court according to the direction of the king. Attorney General v. Syderfen, 1 Vern. 224. \u201cA devise of lands to the church-wardens of a parish (who are not a cor poration capable of holding lands) for a charitable purpose, although void at law will be sustained in equity.\u201d 2 Eq. 415. In White v. White, 1 Bro. C. C. 12, it was held that a devise as a charity to a corporation by a wrong name, though void at law was valid in equity. In the case of the Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, supra, which was in equity, and certified from the U. S. Circuit Court for the district of Virginia, the bequest, which gave rise to the controversy, was extremely similar to the one under consideration.\nIt was a residuary legacy to \u201cthe Baptist Association that for ordinary\u201d met at Philadelphia annually, as a permanent fund \u201c for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination \u201d who should \u201c appear promising for the ministry, always giving a preference to the descendants\u201d of the testator\u2019s family. The Baptist Association was, like the Theological Seminary in this case, a regularly organized but unincorporated body at and previous to the date of the will, and was not incorporated until after the death of the testator. . The cause was decided against the legatees, on the ground that the statute of the 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, was not in force in Virginia, and that without the aid of that statute, the Court in Virginia exercising the same jurisdiction as the English Court of Chancery possessed at common law, had no power to enforce a charity void at law; but Ch. J. Marshall in delivering the opinion of the Court remarked, \u201c that such a legacy would be sustained in England is admitted.\u201d This case so far as it decided that the English Court of Chancery had no power to execute a charity void at law, independently of the statute of Elizabeth, was overruled by the case of Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, supra, in which, after a very full review of all the authorities, it was held \u201c that there is an inherent jurisdiction in equity in cases of charity, and that charity is one of those objects for which a Court of equity has at all times interfered to make good that which at law was an illegal or informal gift; and that cases of charity in Courts of equity in England were valid independently of anil previously to the statute of Elizabeth.\u201d Had such been the opinion entertained by the Court in the case of the Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, there can be no doubt that the legacy in that case would have been sustained as a charity.\nR. Crawford, for the plaintiff.\n'S.

J.\nSo far as regards the parties to the contract to build, the enactment of the statute in question was clearly constitutional. No alteration of their rights was .proposed, further than to give a- specific remedy against the property, in addition to the remedy which the contractor had against it indirectly, by action ; and retrospective laws have always been sustained where they touched not the right, but the remedy. So far there is no dispute. But the scene may be changed by the introduction of a purchaser for value actually paid, at a time when the property was free from the supposed lien; and it is proper to, say, that his having had notice of a defective lien would be immaterial. By Simon v. Brown, 3 Yeates, 186, followed in Heister v. Fortner, 2 Binn. 40, it was established that the defective registry of a deed is a nullity; and in the case before us, the lien filed was a nullity which the purchaser was not bound to notice. Even had actual notice of it been given him, he would have been informed of nothing but an abortive attempt to create a lien where none could exist; and if. he paid for a title actually unencumbered at the time, a statute to create an incumbrance on it afterwards would be a statute to take so much out of his pocket and give it to another destitute of claim to it, either legal or moral. The case, therefore, stands clear of the principle of Menges v. Wertman, 1 Barr, 223, in which it was admitted that the legislature may add a legal sanction to a moral obligation; for no such obligation rested on the original owner, and certainly none on the purchaser. A mechanics\u2019 lien depends on no principle of moral right, but on positive enactment, of which it is the creature; and beyond the terms of which it cannot be extended. If, then, the legislature cannot directly create a lien for the debt of another, where none existed before, it cannot do it indirectly by putting a particular construction on a statute which had received a different construction before the period of the purchase.\nWhen this property was sold, the lien filed by the plaintiff, as contractor for the building, was, by the laws of the land, undoubtedly void. Before any legislative interpretation of the act of 1836 had been attempted, as to the point before us, it had been settled in Jones v. Shawhan, 4 Watts & Serg. 264, and re-asserted in Hoatz v. Patterson, 5 Watts & Serg. 538, that a contractor to build had no lien at all. I mean not to go into a formal defence of those decisions, but if ever human statute disclosed an intention not to be mistaken, that statute disclosed a.n intention that the contractor whom it ordered to stand as a respondent, should not, in any case, assume the attitude of a demandant. And there was cogent reason why he should not; for, unlike those who dealt with him as a middle-man, he had an opportunity to secure himself by his contract with his employer, and if he omitted to embrace it, the fault was his own. It was the frequency of loss sustained by mechanics and dealers in consequence of the employment of this kind of agent, which first induced the legislature to give them a lien on the building ; for if the owner of the ground had continued to be his own master-builder, as he was in the primitive days of the province, those who dealt with him would have had no juster claim to such a lien than the ploughman of another\u2019s field would have to a lien on the crop. It was not the merit of the contractor, but the loss he occasioned, that gave rise to the system; and the object of it was not to secure him, but to secure those who had else been put in jeopardy by him. But if to their legitimate liens he had been allowed to add a particular lien of his own, there would have been a scuffle between him and the furnisher of the labour or material for the pay, in which the court would have been employed to determine, not whether the article had been furnished on the credit of the building, but whether the contractor had made it his own by having paid for it; and that would have involved a variety of matters of account, set-off, and dealings between him and his competitor. In prospective cases, under the explanatory act which alloAvs double and conflicting liens to be filed for the same-thing, this scuffle will sometimes occur. The person who drafted it, evidently meant to conceal the nature and extent of the construction that had been put on the principal act. The words purport to validate all \u201c claims for labour done, and materials furnished and used in erecting any house or building which may have been, or shall be, erected under, or in pursuance of any contract or agreement for the same.\". Now, whether the concluding words be referred to a \u2019contract for the building, or a contract for the materials and labour \u2014 and they may be indifferently referred to either \u2014 it certainly had not been determined that the mechanic or material-man could not file where there was the existence of either of them, or both. No more had been determined than that the master-builder, or contractor for the building, could not file for his services and skill, in exclusion of the mechanic or material-man, for whom alone the statute had provided.\nThe facility with which general laws for particular cases are obtained, of which the party to be affected has neither notice nor suspicion till the mischief brewing bursts on his head, calls on us imperatively to execute the paramount and immediate legislation of the people in preference to subordinate and inconsistent legislation by their delegates. This facility is inseparable from the most careful and enlightened legislation; for it is impossible for the members of a popular body to perceive the tendency of every section that may be introduced into a bill in the process of its readings. Of one thing we may be sure \u2014 that as the legislature never wilfully transcends its legitimate powers, it will be glad to have its inadvertencies corrected.\nWe might, perhaps, make this case, by a forced construction, an exception to the explanatory act, as not being within its Spirit; but as the words evidently embrace all cases of the class, but those expressly excepted, it seems to be more frank, and not less courteous, to meet the question on its constitutional ground. Besides, as the act is undoubtedly constitutional, in a particular view of the facts, the plaintiff has a right to go before a jury on the evidence of them. The judge took for granted, what is the turning point of the cause, that the terre-tenants are purchasers for value actually paid; of which there is no other proof on the paper-book than the usual recital in the body of the deed, and a receipt at the foot of it, which were held, in The Union Canal Company v. Young, 1 Whart. 432, to be incompetent evidence of payment against a third person; and which, it was held in Hamilton v. McGuire, 3 Serg. & Rawle, 355, may be rebutted between the original parties. The cause, therefore, goes back for trial with an intimation that it ought to be left to the jury with a direction to find for the terre-tenants generally, if they shall prove that \u00a1they have paid the entire purchase-money \u2014 not merely secured it \u2014 or for the plaintiffs to the amount of the unpaid residue, if their demand shall reach so far; or their whole demand, if nothing has been paid: and that the burden of proof is on th.e terre-tenants.\nJudgment reversed, and venire facias de novo awarded."},{"case_name":"Potter Griffith et al. vs. The State of Delaware","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/456904\/","date":"1848-06-01","court":"Delaware Court of Errors and Appeals","content":"i Wootten, J.,\ndelivered the unanimous opinion of the Court, as\nfollows :\n\u25a0 Benjamin Potter, the testator, by his last will and testament, bearing date the 26th day of June, 1839, and by sundry codicils thereto, after disposing of and giving certain portions of his estate to his relatives and friends, devised all the balance or residue of his estate, real, personal, and mixed, of every description, to Potter Griffith, George S. Atkins and Levin H. Adams, in trust for the support and maintenance of the poor white citizens of Kent county; \u201c who by timely assistance might be kept from the Poor House and from becoming inmates thereof,\u201d excluding from the benefit of any part of his bounty,all such persons as might be within the walls of the Poor House; and further directing his real estate, passing under this devise,to be rented by his executors,and the net proceeds applied to and for the purposes above mentioned, \u201c by agents to be appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court or Levy Court of Kent county, as might be deemed most proper.\u201d\nThe questions presented by the case stated are whether the devise so made, in and by the 18th item of the said last will and testament and the several codicils thereto, unto and for the charitable uses, objects and purposes in manner and form set forth in the case stated, are valid and capable of being sustained and carried out in a court of chancery, according to the rules and principles of a court of equity; or whether the same are void or illegal, and not capable of being sustained and carried out in' a court of chancery, according to the rules and principles of equity.\nThe important principles of law which are applicable to the subject matter of this suit, have been the subject of much labor and research, and have elicited a vast amount of legal learning; and much has been displayed in the argument of this cause. Therefore, although we by no means look upon this case as one free from difficulty and obscurity, yet in its adjudication we are not left entirely in the dark, without a light or beacon to guide us; but our pathway is lighted up by the opinions and decisions of some of the ablest jurists that ever adorned the Bench, as well of this country as of that from which we derived our code of laws.\nAssuming the fact, which is conceded in the argument, that the testator designed by this devise to create a trust for charitable uses and purposes, and that he employed proper and suitable language to convey the legal estate to the trustees, we proceed to the consideration of the respective questions presented by the case stated and the arguments in the cause.\nIt can scarcely be necessary to do more than merely glance at the objections made to the validity of this devise on the ground that there are no trustees to execute the trust. The trustees designated arid appointed by the testator may, it is true, decline and refuse to execute the trust; but we are at a loss to conceive on what principle such refusal can divert the fund from the legitimate .objects of the trust, and thus defeat both the will of the testator and the charity. It is a principle too well settled to. require the aid of reasoning-or argument at the present day, that a valid trust shall never tail for want of a proper trustee. 2 Sugd. on Powers 174; 1 Chancery Cases 180 ; Coke on Litt. 190 b. 4. Sec. 4. It is a general principle of equity that wherever may be the legal estate,if the trust is valid, it will be protected and enforced in a court of equity. It -is also a general rule, that a legacy given in trust does not lapse by the death\" of the trustee in the testator\u2019s life time, but survives for the betiefit of the cestui que trust. The substance of the charity remains notwithstanding the death cf the trustee in the testator\u2019s lifetiriie, though at law the legacy lapses. Shelford on Mortmain, (36 Law Library) 367. It is sufficient that the trust appears; and if the party creating it docs not appoint a trustee to' execute it a court of equity will follow the legal estate and decree the person in wboiri it is vested, a trustee to execute the trust. Ambler\u2019s R. 571; 1 Bro. Oh. Rep. 81\u00bb Lord Coke says, it is a rule of equity, which admits \u2019of no \"exception, that a valid trust shall not fail for want of a trustee to execute it; but a court of equity will execute the office. Ooke Litt. 113 a,note. Trusts are often created by will without the designation of any trustee to execute them; or it may be matter of doubt upon the terms of the will, who is the proper party. But a court of equity will not hesitate, where doubts exist as to the party, to declare who is the proper person to execute the trust; and, where no trustee is designated, it will proceed to execute the trust by its own authority, 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. sec. 1059; 1 Ves. Sr. R. 475.\nIt is said, however, that the objection to the validity of this devise is rather on account of the uncertainty of the cestuis que trust than for the want of trustees; and it is insisted that the description of the beneficiaries is so vague and uncertain that,even if there were a power of seleption appointed, the devise must fail as a trust.\nThe class of persons intended to be the recipients of the testator's bounty are described by him as the \u201c poor of Kent County, who by timely assistance may be kept from being carried t\u00f3 the Poor House and becoming inmates thereof; \u201d And the tesjator directs the distrj bution of the fund \u201c to be made by agents to be appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court or Levy Court of Kent County, as may be deemed most proper.\u201d\nIs this description of the beneficiaries so vague and indefinite that they cannot be selected and ascertained by the agents who were to be appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court or Levy Court ? Are they not as susceptible of ascertainment as \u201cthe poor inhabitants of Saint Leonard Shoreditch,\u201d in the case of Atty. Gen\u2019l vs. Clarke,Ambler's Reports,422 ? This was a bequest of the interest of \u00a34200, of bank annuities, to \u201c the poor inhabitants of Saint Leonard Shoreditch and it was insisted by the defendants that the bequest jvas void for uncertainty in the description of the persons to take ; but the bequest was sustained and the fund distributed among the poor inhabitants not receiving alms. The description in this case was much more general than in the one now under consideration, but the distribution of the fund was confined to the poor of Saint Leonard Shoreditch not receiving alms ; for, without such restriction, it was said the rich as Well as the poor would be benefited, which could not have been the intention of the testator.\nIn this case Col. Potter restricts the distribution of the fund to the poor of Kent County who by timely assistance may be prevented from becoming inmates of the Poor House; and he expressly prohibits the bestowal of any part of his bounty upon any persons not within this description, or who are inmates of the Poor House.\nA bequest was made for the benefit of the poor dissenting ministers of the gospel residing and living in any of the counties of England, to be paid to the treasurer of such charitable society or fund for the time being, for that purpose, as the major part of them should direct or appoint. It appeared that there were three distinct societies of dissenters, and that collections were made for the poor ministers of each. It was held that the bequest was not void for uncertainty ; but that the fund should be distributed to and among the poor ministers of each society. Walter vs. Childs, Ambler\u2019s R. 524.\nThe beneficiaries are said to be further uncertain, because no effectual provision is made by the testator for their selection ; and in support of this objection it is argued that under the provision made by the testator the power of selection is vested nowhere; that it does not exist solely in either of the courts named, nor in both collectively; and, therefore, it is contended, that neither can make the appointment of the agents who were designed to be die instruments of distribution; and consequently no cestuis que trust can be brought into being and invested with rights to be asserted in a court of equity. If this argument is tenable, and it is true that a power vested in any one of two or more persons is not sufficient authority for the action of either, by what authority did the late Court of Common Pleas and Supreme Court of this State exercise concurrent j urisdiction ? As well might it be said that the authority to take the acknowledgment of deeds no where exists, because such authority is not conferred upon one particular officer or class of officers, but' is' delegated to several. But if both the Orphans\u2019 Court and Levy Court should neglect or refuse to appoint such agents as the testator designated and provided for by his will, would such neglect or refusal defeat the general intention of the testator and deprive the objects of his bounty of the benefit of the charity ? Or, would it not come within the province of the Court of Chancery to supply the defect thus occasioned in the mode prescribed by the testator for the execution of the trust, by creating an agency to effect the distribution of the fund in accordance with the will of the testator ? The agents are the mere instruments of distribution\u2014the hand, as it were, to parcel oiit the fund and carry into effect the general intention of the testator, which, being charity, will not be allowed to fail from the neglect or refusal of the trustees to execute the trust or from the neglect or refusal of the Orphans\u2019 Court or Levy Court to appoint the agents to distribute the fund. Atty. Gen. vs. Boultbee, 2 Ves. Jr. 380 ; Atty. Gen. vs. Syderfen, 1 Vernon 224; S. C. 7 Ves. Jr. 43; Mills vs. Farmer, 1 Mer. 55. In these cases the object of the charity and the persons to designate it were both wanting; yet the defects were supplied and the general intention of the testator, which was charity, carried into effect.\n\u2022In the case now under consideration the devise is not so general; but the testator designated and described the objects of his bounty and marked out the plan by which it was to be distributed. The principle which governed the cases just referred to, therefore, applies a fortiori to this case; the appointment of the agents, merely, to effect the distribution of the fund in the mode and to the persons designated and described by the testator, being the defect sought to be supplied by the aid of the Court of Chancery.\nThe argument against validity of this devise for want of certainty in the beneficiaries seems to be based on the assumption of the fact that personal gifts and bequests to charity are of the same character and governed by the same principles of law; whereas I apprehend there is a manifest distinction and that the principles which govern the one class of cases are wholly inapplicable to the other. Bequests to charity seem to be an exception to the general rule laid down in reference to personal or individual gifts ; and the very authority cited at the bar and mainly relied on in support of this objection to the devise fully sustains this position and illustrates the principle which marks the distinction between the two classes of bequests. In ..Powell on Devises (21 Law Library,) 215. n 7 (which is the authority just alluded to) it is said by Sir Wm. Grant, in reference to gifts void for uncertainty, that an exception should be stated, applicable to bequests to charity, with respect to which \u201c it is now settled upon authority, which it is too late to controvert, that where a charitable purpose is expressed, however general, the bequest shall not fail on account of the uncertainty of the object, but the particular mode of the application will be directed by the King in some cases, in others by the Court of Chancery.\u201d Morice vs. Bp. of Dunham, 9 Ves. 405. Here a number of authorities are cited illustrative of this principle, some of which are very similar to the case now under consideration ; as the case of a gift to the poor in general, Atty. Gen. vs. Matthews, 2 Lev. 167 ; Atty. Gen. vs. Clarke, Amb. 422; Bishop of Hereford vs. Lady Twysden, 7 Ves. 324; Paice vs. Archbishop of Canterbury, 14 Ves. Jr. 364; or, a gift to charitable uses generally, Clifford vs. Francis, Freem, Ch. Cases, 330 ; Atty. Gen. vs. Herrick, Ambler 712 ; or, a gift to such charitable uses as the testator\u2019s executor shall appoint and the testator revokes the appointment of the executor,, White vs. White 1 Bro. Ch. R. 12 ; or, a gift to such charitable uses as A shall appoint and A dies in the life time of the testator, Moggridge vs. Thackwell, 1 Ves. Jr. 464 ; 3 Bro. Ch. R. 517; 7 Ves. Jr. 36; 13 Ves. Jr. 416; or, he neglects or refuses to appoint, Atty. Gen vs. Boultbee, 2 Ves. Jr. 380 ; or, a gift to such charitable uses as the testator himself has appointed and no such appointment can be found, Atty Gen. vs. Syderfen, 1 Vernon 224 ; same case 7 Ves. Jr. 43 n; or, to such charitable uses as he shall appoint and he dies without making an 'appointment, Freem. Ch. Cases 261; Mills vs. Farmer 1 Mer. 55 ; or, a gift to the trustees of a charity who refuse to accept, Atty. Gen. vs. Andrews 3 Ves. Jr. 633. In these, and all such cases, though the bequest would, upon the principles which govern the construction of testamentary dispositions in favor of general objects, be void for uncertainty; yet, the object being charity, the crown, as parens patriae, or the court, will execute it. Charities are so highly favored in the law that they have always received a more liberal construction than the law will allow in gifts to individuals. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jr. Sec. 1163. . If an estate is devised to such persons as the executor shall name and no executor is appointed ; or, if one being appointed, he dies in the lifetime of the testator and no other is appointed in his place, the bequest becomes a mere nullity ; yet, such a bequest, if expressed to be for a charity, would be good ; and the Court of Chancery would, in such case, assume the office of executor and effectuate the bequest. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. Sec. 1166; Mills vs. Farmer, 1 Mer. R. 55, 94; Moggridge vs. Thackwell, 7 Ves. Jr. 37 ; Atty. Gen. vs. Jackson, 11 Ves. Jr. 365, 367. So, if a legacy is given to trustees to distribute and they all die in the testator\u2019s life time, yet the defect will be supplied in equity. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. Sec. 1166; Atty. Gen vs. Hickman, 2 Eq. Cas Ab. 193; Duke on Char. Us. 476; Moggridge vs. Thackwell,3 Bro. Ch. Rep. 517; S. C. 1 Ves. Jr. 464.\nAnother objection taken to the validity of the devise is that it creates a perpetuity, and thus renders the lands devised forever inalienable, being devised to the trustees to be by them rented and the net proceeds to be applied for the uses and purposes of the trust. As a general principle, it is true that the law prohibits such dispositions of real estate, and in general it cannot be thus tied up ; but it nevertheless in this, as in many other respects, makes charity an exception to this rule against perpetuities. Lewis on Perpetuity, 687 ; (52 Law Lib. 437.) It follows, from the nature of the purposes and objects to which the property is devoted and the character of the ownership to which it is subjected, that for all practicable purposes it will be in dead or unserviceable hands. This, it is obvious, is the characteristic of alienations to charitable uses : it is in the very nature of such dispositions to withdraw the subject of them from any kind of circulation, as a contrary course would defeat the manifest object, which is the sustentation of the charitable institutions, or the carrying out in continuity of the benevolent purposes for which they are made.\nUntil the Statu'e 9 Geo, II. eh.\" 36, little restraint was imposed upon alienations of this sort, but the apprehensions, entertained in the reign of Geo. IT., that persons on their death beds might make large and improvident dispositions of their property for such purposes gave rise to this Statute, which was designed to counteract or check such dispositions ; and under the supposition that men were in but little danger of being pornieiously generous at the sacrifice of their own comfort or enjoyment, when uninfluenced by the near approach of death, it was considered that this end would be sufficiently attained by preventing persons from aliening more of their lands than they chose to part with in their lifetime. Lewis on Perpetuity, 689.(52 Law Lib. 438); 3 Peters S. C. R. 99. In reference to the Statute 9 Geo. II., Sir William Grant said; \u201c In its causes, its objects, its provisions, its qualifications, and its exceptions, it was a law wholly English, calculated for purposes of local policy, complicated with establishments, and incapable, without great incongruity in the effect of being transferred, as it stands, into the code of any other country.\u201d\nBut it is said that our statutory law prohibits the disposition of lands in perpetuity, and that the devise in this case is void on that ground. There are but two statutes in this State which at all approximate to the subject. The one is that of 17 Geo.II, passed in 1744, entitled \u201cAn Act for the enabling religious societies of Protestants within this government to purchase lands for burying ground, churches, houses for worship, schools, &c.\u201d This Act authorizes religious societies of Protestants to purchase, take and receive, by gift, grant or otherwise, land for burying-grounds, erecting churches, houses of religious worship, schools, and alms-houses, for any estate whatsoever,and to hold the same for such uses andpurposes ;provided, (by the fourth section) that nothing in the act contained should be deemed, taken or construed to enable any of the said religious societies of people, or any person or persons whatsoever in trust for them or to their use, to purchase, take dr receive any lands or tenements by gift, grant or otherwise, for or towards the maintenance or support of the said churches, houses of worship, schools, or alms-houses, or the people belonging to the same, or for any other use or purpose save for the uses in the Act before mentioned. It is n,ot contended that the devise in question is rendered invalid by this Act, or in any wise afltected by it; but it is insisted that any devise of land, or of money to be laid out in land, is void except in the mode allowed by the third section of the Act of 1787 (Digest Del. Laws. 460,461.) This is an act designed exclusively for the protection and government of the temporal concerns of all religious societies or' denominations, the first section of which provides that each and every religious society or congregation of Christians, of whatever sect or denomination, may elect or choose any number of their society, not exceeding seven nor less than three,to be trustees of the same; which said trustees and their successors in office are constituted a body politic and corporate, by whatever name they may take and assume ; arid the second section provides that the said trustees, in their corporate name and capacity, shall forever thereafter be authorized in law to purchase, take, hold, receive, arid enjoy any messuages, lands, tenements, rents and other hereditaments and real estate, in fee-simple or otherwise, and also goods and chattels, sum or sums of money, and personal estate whatsoever, to and for the us) of their respective societies or congregations ; provided (by the third section) that all gifts, grants, bargains, sales arid conveyances of and for the same shall be made by deed, twelve calendar months, at least, next before the death of the donor, grantor or bargainor; otherwise to be void. The trustees of these religious societies are by this Act made and constituted corporate bodies, and like all other corporations are the mere creatures of the law, created and existing by it and only in the manner and for the purposes therein and thereby limited and prescribed ; and, therefore, they cannot exercise any power whatever not expressly given them, much less that which the law creating them expressly declares they shall not have or exercise. It follows, therefore, that any gift, grant, or conveyance of lands, or money to be laid out in lands, or any other gift, grant or conveyance to the trustees of any such society, not conformable to the provisions of the Act from which they derive their existence as a corporate body, would be absolutely void; and this was the ground upon which the decision of the court was based in the case of the State vs. Bates, Adm\u2019r of John Wiltbank dec\u2019d. 2Harring. R. 18. This was the case of a devise by Wiltbank of the proceeds of the sale of real estate to the trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Dover, in their corporate capacity, to be applied by them in such manner as they should devise, towards educating poor children of the metiibers of paid church. The Court in that case very properly held that the devise was void, not on the ground, however, that a devise for charitable purposes could not be made and enforced, but because it was a devise to the trustees of a religious society, falling precisely within the prohibition of the very law which gives them existence as a corporate body, not being conformable either to the provisions of the Act of 1787 or of 17 Geo. II, in 1744, but in direct derogation of both.\nThe case now under consideration is of a different character ; and altogether unlike that of a devise to trustees of a religious society. It cannot be classed among the mischiefs intended to be guarded against by our Statute; nor does it fall within their prohibtion.\nIn the view which we have taken of this case it is one of a valid trust for charitable uses and purposes, with trustee appointed by the testator to execute it, with the aid of agents, to be appointed, to select the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty in a mode sufficiently indicated by the testator, and which is not prohibited or rendered invalid by any statute of this State.\nThe remaining and perhaps the most important question, next to be considered, is,\u201c whether the devise is capable of being sustained and carried out in a court of chancery, according to the rules and principles of equity.\u201d\nThis objection leads to the inquiry whether the Court of Chanceryf prior to and independent of the Statute 43 Elizabeth, had jurisdiction to enforce charitable uses, or whether its jurisdiction was derived solely from that Statute. We find no evidence on the face of the S tatute itself that such j urisdiction was conferred by it. It contains no provision from which such a conclusion can be drawn, either directly or inferentially, except in case of appeal from the commissioners. The Statute itself, then, affording no evidence as to the source from whence this jurisdiction was derived we are obliged to seek other information; and we know of none so likely to lead us to proper and correct conclusions as adjudged cases by learned and able jurists, whose opinions have been formed upon a thorough investigation of the subject and are the result of much labor and research. In the case of Eyre vs. the Countess of Shaftsbury, 2 P. Wms. 119, Sir Joseph Jekyll said \u201c in the case of charity the King,pro bona publico, has an original right to superintend the care thereof, so that, abstracted from the Statute of Elizabeth relating to charitable uses, and antecedent to it. as well as since, it has been every day's practice to file informations in chancery, in the Attorney General\u2019s name for the establishment of charities. 2 Equity Cas. Ab. 710. And Lord Northington in the case of Atty. Gen. vs. Tancred, 1 Eden R. 10; same case in Amb. R. 351; 1 Wm. Blk. R. 90; and Lord Chief Justice Wilmot in the case of Atty. Gen. vs. Lady Downing, both held the same doctrine. Lord Redesdale, who was confessedly a very learned and able chancery lawyer, in the case of the Atty. Gen. vs. the Mayor of Dublin, 1 Bligh\u2019s R. 347, says, in reference to the Statute 43 Elizabeth, \u201c the Statute only created a new jurisdiction, a jurisdiction created by commission, but the proceedings of the commissioners were made subject to appeal to the Lord Chancellor, and he might reverse or affirm what they had done, or make such order as he might think fit for preserving the controlling jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery as it existed beforejffie passing of that Statute; and there was no doubt,\u201d he said, \u201c but the same thing could he done by information by the Attorney General in the exercise of his right of prerogative ; that the King,as parens patries,has the right, through his proper officers, to call upon the several courts of justice, according to their respective jurisdictions, to see that right is done to his subjects who are incapable to act for themselves as in the case of charities and other cases.\u201d It appears, therefore, that Lord Redesdale repudiates the doctrine that the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery over charitable uses was derived from the Statute 43 Elizabethand he maintains it in the fullest and broadest terms as being the inherent jurisdiction of chancery independently of and antecedent to the Statute of Elizabeth. In the case of Atty. Gen. vs. Middleton, 2 Ves. Sr. 327 (so far back as 1751), Lord Chancellor Hardwicke said that information in the name of the Attorney General as an officer of the crown was not a head of the Statute of charitable uses, because original jurisdiction was exercised in that court before; but that was always in cases now provided for by that Statute, that is, charities at large. So in the case of Atty. Gen. vs. Matthews, 2 Levinz 167, it was held that general charities were not within the power of the commissioners under the Statute 43 Elizabeth. \u201cThis being a general charity, and for the poor in general,\u201d says Lord Keeper Finch, \u201c the commissioners have nothing to do with it, but it is to be determined by the Court of Chancery on information by the Attorney General in behalf of the King \u201d And, in the case of The Incorporated Company vs. Richards,1 Drury & Warren\u2019s R. 258, Lord Chancellor Sugden, in a very able and elaborate opinion upon the very point now under consideration, declared that in equity there is inherent jurisdiction over cases of charity; and that it is one of the objects for which a court of equity has at all times interfered to make good that which at common law was void. In the case of Sarah Zands will, in the Circuit Court of the U. S., at the April Term 1833, Judge Baldwin, after a very laborious research into the English statutes and authorities, arrived at the same conclusion; and, in a very able and lucid opinion, maintained the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction independently of and antecedent to the Statute 43 Elizabethan which opinion Judge Hopkinson entirely concurred, Here is a current of authorities, sustained by the opinions and dicta of very eminent Judges, establishing the doctrine that, independently of and prior to the Statute 43 Elizabeth, the Court of Chancery could enforce charitable uses under its general jurisdiction, and that such jurisdiction had been exercised both subsequent and antecedent to that Statute. The defendants, however, maintain the contrary doctrine ;'and,in support of their position, they rely mainly upon the case of The Baptist Association, vs. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheaton 1, and the authorities there cited in support of the objection to the validity of the devise in that case. It is, doubtless, true that the opinion of the court in the case of The Baptist Association vs. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, was delivered by a judge who stands deservedly pre-eminent in his profession, equalled by few and perhaps surpassed by none of his day in this country, and whose opinions are entitled to great respect. But, since that opinion was announced by Chief Justice Marshall, the same Court, so recently as the January Term 1844, decided the case of Vidal et. al vs. the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the city of Philadelphia, in which they overrule and abandon the principles upon which the decision in The Baptist Association case was based; and they take the ground that antecedent to and independently of the Statute 43 Elizabeth the Court of Chancery had jurisdiction over charitable uses. Mr. Justice Story, in delivering the opinion of the Court in the case just referred to, after reviewing all the authorities, including the case of The Baptist Association vs. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs,which he said was strongly relied on as fully in point, says, \u201c but very strong additional light has been thrown upon this subject by the recent publications of the com- missioners on the public records in England which contain a very-carious and interesting collection of the chancery records in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and in the earlier reigns. Among these are found many cases in which the Court of Chancery entertained jurisdiction over charities long before the Statute 43 Elizabeth ; and some fifty of these cases, extracted from the printed calendars, have been laid before us. They establish, in the most satisfactory and conclusive manner, that cases of charities, where there were trustees appointed for general and indefinite charities* as well as for specific charities, were familiarly known to and acted upon, and enforced in the Court of Chancery. In some of these cases the charities were not only of an uncertain and indefinite nature, but, as far as we can gather from the imperfect statement in the printed records, they were also cases where there were either no trustees appointed or the trustees were not competent to take. These records, therefore, do, in a remarkable manner, confirm the opinion of Sir Joseph J ekyll, Lord Northington, Lord Chief Justice Wilmot, Lord Redesdale.and Lord Chancellor Sugden. Whatever doubt, therefore, might properly be entertained upon the subject when the case of The Baptist Association vs. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, was before this Court in 1819, these doubts were entirely removed by the later and more satisfactory sources of information to which we have alluded.\u201d\nThe Baptist Association case, and those of Virginia and Maryland which were evidently decided on its authority, and of course must fall with it, being thus stricken, as it were, from the catalogue of judicial decisions, the question rests on the authority of adjudged' cases in several of the different States, affirmed by the United States Court in the case of Vidal vs. the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of Philadelphia, just referred to, all going to establish most conclusively an inherent jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery anterior to, and independent of, the Statute of 43 Elizabeth.\nIf the Court of Chancery in England is clothed with this jurisdiction, the same jurisdiction belongs to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Equity jurisdiction in this State was originally vested in the Court of Common Pleas,and the Justices of that Court were clothed with the powers of the High Court of Chancery of Great Britain and required to observe the rules and practice of that Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction thus conferred upon them. 1 Del. Laws, 130, 131. And, by the Constitution of 1792 of the State of Delaware, the equity jurisdiction theretofore exercised by the Court of Common Pleas, was separated from the common law jurisdiction and vested in a Chancellor, who should hold a Court of Chancery in the several counties of the State. Art. VI, Sec. 14 of Constitution of 1792.\nUnder the view which we have taken of the respective branches of this case, it is the opinion of the Court that the decree of the Chancellor ought to be, and it accordingly is, hereby, affirmed."},{"case_name":"David R. Kemper v. The Trustees of Lane Seminary and others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/631512\/","date":"1848-12-01","court":"Supreme Court of Ohio","content":"Birchard, C. J.\nTwo grounds of objection are taken to this bill. 1st. That it is not competent for the complainant to maintain a suit in equity, to enforce the performance of the trusts upon which the trustees of Lane Seminary hold the corporate property.\n2d. That if such suit may be maintained by any private individual, that complainant has no such interest in the subject-matter as will enable him to maintain it.\nIn support of the bill, and in answer to these grounds of objection, it is argued that there is a direct privity of estate and of contract between the grantor and grantee, in the deed, and so long as both parties are living, either party may enforce its execution. If this be so, it must be because there remains some interest in the grantor, as -cestui que trust, or beneficiary, 01 that he stands in the relation of founder, retaining an interest\nWe can see no such interest. The mere fact of being a Presbyterian of the Old School is insufficient. No one would pretend that any member of that branch of the Presbyterian church could maintain the bill. But if that relationship would in any case be sufficient, such suit would have to be presented by all persons belonging to the society, or by some one suing for himself in behalf of all. This bill proceeds on no such ground, and as said before, mere membership of that branch of the Presbyterian church would not be sufficient. This is not like the case of one who, being a member of a congregation, sues in behalf of himself and other members of the same congregation to compel the proper administration of a common property, in which each and every member has a specific but joint interest, for here there is no interest in the estate. The deed expressly grants away the entire estate, and covenants that in no case shall any part of the property or its avails ever revert to the grantors, their heirs or assigns,\u201d but in case the Lane Seminary shall ever fail or become extinct, shall go to certain religious or benevolent societies. No right remained in Kemper under this deed. The property from him passed to a public institution as a gift to the public, or for the benefit of the public, and he can claim no right to interfere beyond that of any other member of community. , The consequences of allowing a suit to proceed in. his name would be that it would conclude nothing, and the door of litigation would never be thereby closed. If Mr. Kemper may file his bill and compe\u2019 an answer, so may any other individual who has donated prop erty or funds to the seminary, for each donor has the same right; and when the suit of one is determined, if it fail, another may prosecute a like suit, and so on ad infinitum, and neither one or all the cases thus decided could be plead in bar to a further litigation. This shows that, however great may be the wrong complained of, there is much propriety in requiring suits of this nature to be carried on and conducted in the name only of a public officer, who may lawfully represent the whole community, or at .least all that portion of it who are interested equally with complainant. It has been claimed that a visitorial power existed in Kemper as founder, which would enable him to supervise the execution of the trust and maintain a bill to correct abuses. But the case shows no such founding of this seminary as^ entitles him to the exercise of visitorial powers. He was but one of several donors, and the donation was to incorporated trustees. This vested the visitorial power of all the donors in those trustees, subject only to the control of a court of chancery for any abuse of their trust. Allen v. McKeen, 1 Sum. Rep. 300. And as before stated, the general chancery power of the court should only be exercised when called into action by a party who may prosecute, and in whose favor or against whom the decision will be obligatory and final as to all matters involved in the litigation. If we are correct in this, the objections presented by the defendants on demurrer are, in the opinion of two members of the court, substantial, and not, as argued by counsel, a mere matter of form.\nBut were it admitted that, as donor, he has a right to require the trustees to adhere strictly to the objects of the donation and not divert the funds, it must still be observed that he is but one of several grantors in the deed, and should not be allowed to proceed and try the question which he makes upon the bill, and which shows the others equally interested, without bringing them before the court.\nAgain, we are asked to allow an amendment, should we deem it important that the suit be brought by the prosecuting attorney. In reply to this it may be said that amendments, when proper, are a matter of discretion, to be granted or refused according to the dictates of a sound legal judgment. Upon the question whether this is a case for amendment we are divided, and give, according to the course of our practice, no opinion, The motion fails on division.\nBill dismissed."},{"case_name":"THE STATE v. STIGALL AND TURNLEY","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/399081\/","date":"1849-10-01","court":"New Jersey Supreme Court","content":"The opinion of the court was delivered by\nRandolph, J.\nThe return to this writ show? that the defendant, Elizabeth M. Stigall, is the mother of the three children required to be produced in court, and that they and their mother are living for the time present with her father, (Charles W. Turnley, the other defendant, but not, as he retains in his custody or control, but merely there at the mother\u2019s request for support and consolation. The father prosecutes the writ, and demands the custody of his three children, and that they should be taken from the mother, and given to him. The parents, without a divorce, live separate aud apart; the mother having left her husband\u2019s abode and taken her children with her, in her return sets up, by way of excuse, various grounds of crimination against the husband, all of which he, in his answer, ex plains or denies, and recriminates the mother and her father. Time was given for the parties to take proof, but none has been taken, and no argument or point has been furnished by counsel, so that the court are under the necessity of looking into the cases, and deciding on general principles, without the intervention of special circumstances. From the return it appears that the three children were of the following ages: Charles William Stigall, born April 30, 1844, Robert Stigall, January 29, 1846, and Elizabeth Rebecca Stigall, May 27, 1848; so that at the return of the writ Elizabeth was thirteen months old, Robert three years and five months, and Charles five years and two months.\nThe custody of children, as a general principle, belongs to 'one or both of the parents, yet for their protection and education, or the preservation of their property, courts of equity, in the exercise of a sound discretion, will deprive both parents of the custody, and place them with third persons. 2 Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 1311, and the cases there referred to.\nWhen a child is brought up on habeas corpus, if of sufficient age and discretion, the court will only ascertain whether the child is under restraint, and if so will merely make an order setting him at liberty, to go where he chooses; and if it be necessary to give effect to that order, will send an officer to see that it is respected and observed. And the same rule applies when a wife, apprentice, or any other person who has arrived to years of discretion, is brought up on habeas corpus, the court usually refusing to make other order, unless it be absolutely necessary. Rex v. Deleval, 3 Burr. 1434; Rex v. Clarksen, 1 Strange 444 ; Rex v. Smith, 2 Ib. 982 ; Case of Woolstonecraft, 4 J. C. R. 80.\nBut where the child is of tender years, and the father and mother have separated, or the wife has left the abode of her husband, it often becomes necessary for the court or judge, on the return of the habeas eorpus, to determine as to the custody of the child, without waiting for the slower action of tile chancellor, or referring the matter to him, as the parens patriae, in the place of the sovereign. There are two classes of cases, in the books, very distinctly marked in character and princi pie, especially in the English decisions ; the one is when the writ is brought up by the mother to remove the custody of the child from the father, or from his control, and the other is when the father sues out the writ to deprive the mother of the custody, and give it to the father. The general principle operating in both cases is, that the father, as head of the family, is entitled to the custody and control of his legitimate child, and may by will delegate that custody to a guardian. Case of Nickerson, 19 Wend. 16; Case of Chegay, 18 Wend. 637; 25 Wend. 72; 3 Hill 400; 9 J. B. Moore 279 ; 5 East 221; 4 Ad. and El. 624 ; Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 1341, a; 1 Bl. Com. 453.\nBut in the case of illegitimate children, the mother, and not the putative father, is entitled to the custody ; and if deprived of it, the court will restore them to her. Rex v. Mosely, 10 Vesey 52, note a ; Rex v. Soper, 5 T. R. 278 ; 7 East 579 ; 2 Inst. 375; 2 Mass. 109.\nUnder the general rule of the common law, courts have not felt authorized to take the child from the father, and give it to the mother, although some very strong cases have arisen which seem to demand the interference of the court. Thus, in the case of De Manneville, 5 East. 221, the court refused to take a child of eight months old from the father, and give it to the mother, on the allegation that he intended to take it out of the kingdom ; and even the chancellor, on application in the same case, (10 Vesey 52) merely made an order restraining the father from removing the child from the kingdom, but refused to order it to be delivered to the mother, living separate from the husband. And in the 'case of Skinner, 9 Moore 279, wherein the mother applied to have the child removed from the father, who was living in jail and cohabiting with a mistress, the court refused to make the order, referring the matter to chancery, as the proper tribunal To the same effect is Ball v. Ball, 2 Sim. 35, and Wellesley v. The Duke of Beaufort, 2 Russ. 9. This rule seemed so harsh and unsatisfactory that parliament was constrained to mitigate its rigor, and now, by 2 & 3 Viet. c. 54, \u00a7 1, the chancellor or master of the rolls, upon petition of the mother of any infant in the custody of the father, or other person under his authority, may make or der for the access of the petitioner, or, if \u00a1he infant be within the age of seven years, for the delivery of such infant to the mother, until he attains such age, under convenient regulations. 2 Harr. Dig. 3379, Tit. Infant 4. But when the father had asked a court of law or a judge to grant an order to reinvest him with the actual custody of his child, the court, before making such order, would look into the case, and notwithstanding the presumed right of the father, would exercise a discretion in the matter : such ever was and still is the law, with much less change in the rule than in the mode of exercising the discretion, or the extent of its exercise. The principle of the action of the court, or refusal to act, is this : the power and right of the father is allowed for the benefit of the child, and not to enable him to govern with arbitrary caprice or tyrannical control, so as to subvert the very object of the law in giving him the authority. Thus, when the children would be exposed to cruelty or gross corruption, immoral principles or habits, or the father is not of ability to provide for the support, education, and future prospects of the child, and the mother, or person with whom the child resides is able, the court will make no order granting the custody of the child to the father. And, too, if the child is of tender years, and especially if a female or of sickly constitution, in the custody of the mother, against whom there is no charge but inability to live with her husband, the court would make no order of removal. The discretion is pretty broad, and perhaps extending with the improvements and refinements of the age, yet it is not arbitrary, but based on sound principles, yet, like all other discretionary proceedings, will take its hue from the officer exercising it. In Rex v. Greenhill, 4 Ad. & El. 624, the father left his home and family, and was cohabiting with a mistress; then the mother left and took with her her three young children. The husband was otherwise of good character, and had large property, the mother none. He olio red to abandon his mistress and be reconciled to his wife, or to take the children to his mansion, to be educated* under the supervision of his mother, and away from any immoral influence. . The wife refused, and the court made the order of removal, on the ground that it would be for the benefit of the children, and there being nothing of cruelty or corruption about the father or his home, the law gave him the custody. But in Rex v. Dobbins, and in Rex v. Wilson, in the same book, p. 664-5, note, where the conduct of the father at his home came within the discretionary exceptions, the court refused to take the child from the mother. In the matter of Waldron, 13 Johns. Rep. 419, where the father was poor, and his wife went home to her father, who was of large estate, when she was delivered of a child and died, leaving the child the heir apparent to his grandfather, and when it was still of tender age, the father applied for his custody; but the court refused it, on account of the inability of the father and the great benefit of the child, and that the special powers of the Court of Chancery in the case invoked would be sufficient to correct any evil. In the case of Nicherson, 19 Johns. 16, the court say the father is the natural guardian, and entitled to the custody of the child, if there be no danger of ill usage or he be not of grossly immoral principles or habits, or unable to provide for him. In the De Hautville case, the child was but twenty-one months old, very sickly, and, in the opinion of physicians, not of an age to be separated from his mother; and, on these grounds the court rightfully refused to remove the child from the mother, and place him with the father. The case derives interest from the station of the parties, the extended and exciting evidence in relation to the history of the marriage and separation of the parents, as well as from the great ability and learned investigations of both counsel and court, yet .in its simple details is of no extraordinary character, and though differing in result from Rex v. Creenhill, yet it comes within the principles and scope of the exceptions stated by the court in that ease; the real difference is in the mode and extent of the discretion. In the English case the court, in a very strong case, exercised their discretion, and removed the child because they considered the exercise within the rule and for the benefit of the child : in the 'American case the court, in not a very strong pase, refused its exercise, for pretty much the same reasons. In the caso of Barry v. Mercein, to be found in 25 Wend. 72, 3 Hill 401, and 8 Paige 47, the same difficulty occurs as to the mode of exercising the discretion, but upon the general principles of law there is no great diversity among the several jurists who examined the matter, and these principles will generally be found to accord with what has been before stated. In Grey\u2019s case, 6 Law Journal 529, the child was of tender years and feeble health, and was left with the mother, though living apart from the husband. So in the present case, the two younger children, one of thirteen months and the other of about three years, are too young to be removed, for any praciical or useful purpose to themselves at least, and as nothing is proved against the mother but her inability to live with her husband, they should for the present remain with her; but an order maybe entered to deliver the eldest child to his father.\nCited in Magee v.

The Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the City of New York, and Margaret Warner and others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6064938\/","date":"1849-12-08","court":"New York Superior Court","content":"Duer, J.\nWe have lately decided in the case of Tucker v. St. Clement's Church , that the words \u201cpious uses,\u201d in the revised act of 1813, relative to the incorporation of religions societies, must be restricted to such uses as are comprehended within the general objects of a religious corporation, to such as its trustees, where no special direction is given, could lawfully dedicate its property, and as the same words are found in the original act of 1784, and in the same connection, we cannot do otherwise than give to them the same interpretation. It was justly remarked by one of the counsel for the heirs at law, that the terms of the preamble to the act of 1784, furnish an additional proof that the construction we have adopted corresponds with the intentions of the original framers of the law. The main objects of the act are, in substance, declared to be, to enable religious societies of every denomination, to provide for the decent support of divine worship, in the form their own judgment and conscience may approve, and, for this purpose, to render them capable in law, of receiving and holding the pious donations of persons desirous to contribute to the support of religion ; and it is a very reasonable inference from this Lpguage, that it was never contemplated by the legislature, that any society incorporated under the act should become a trustee for any purpose unconnected with the maintenance of its ownfaith and worship.\nThe use to which, the Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church are directed by the will to apply the rents and profits of the real estate which is devised to them, seems entirely foreign to the purposes of the institution as a religious society. It is a general charity, not confined to the members of the church, and it may well be doubted whether such a charity can be regarded as one of the objects to which the trustees of the corporation, in the exercise of their discretion, could lawfully apply its funds. We strongly incline to think that it is not a \u201c pious use \u201d within the meaning of the statute, and wTere it necessary, would so decide. It is not necessary, however, to place our decision upon this ground, for admitting that the words \u201cpious uses\u201d are to be understood in the largest sense of which they are susceptible, so as to include, not only extrinsic uses, but such as are charitable, as distinguished from those which are pious in the stricter sense of the term, we are, for other reasons, very clearly of opinion, that the devise to the trustees as a corporation, for such is not denied to be its meaning and legal effect, cannot be sustained. It is inconsistent with the prohibitory clause in the statute of wills, (2 R. S., \u00a7 3, p. 57,) since it is made directly to a corporation, which, in the words of the statute, is \u201c not expressly authorized by its charter, or by statute, to take by devise.\u201d The testator, by the addition of a codicil, republished his will after the revised statutes were in force, and thus rendered its construction subject to their provisions, in the same maimer as if it had then been originally made. In construing the prohibition in the statute, we cannot reject the word \u201c expressly,\u201d as superfluous ; we cannot give the same construction to the clause, as if this significant word had not been inserted ; for in truth, it is only by its insertion that the prohibition in the present statute is rendered at all different from the exception in the former; and to remove existing doubts as to the construction of the exception, it appears clearly from the original note of the revisers, was the object of its introduction, (3 R. S. 2d edition.) The evident meaning of the clause, as it now stands, is, that in judging of the validity of a devise to a corporation, the intent of the legislature to enable the corporation to take by devise, is not to be collected by probable reasoning, but. that the necessary authority must be given in terms so clear and positive, as not to admit of any other construction ; it must be expressed, not implied. It cannot be said, that the act of 1784- contains an express authority, to the societies incorporated under it, to take by devise; it is certain, that if such an authority is given at all, it is given only by implication. Hence, unless we disregard entirely tbe prohibition in the statute, we must declare that the devise in this case is illegal and void.\nIt is said, however, that the corporate powers of the church to which this devise is made, cannot be affected by the prohibitory clause in the revised statutes, since the prohibition ought not to be construed as applying to existing corporations, so as to take from them any rights or powers which they possessed by virtue of any previous grant. This church has been a corporation more than half a century; it was incorporated under the act of 1784, and the argument is, that if by the fair interpretation of that act, it was authorized to take by devise, this author ity , although given only by implication, could not be revoked or altered by any subsequent action of the legislature. The prohibition in the statute, if construed as such a revocation, would be an unconstitutional exercise of power, winch we cannot presume was intended by the legislature, and which, at any rate, a court of justice will refuse to sanction. The reasoning is specious, but we are satisfied that it proceeds upon an erroneous view of the powers and intentions of the legislature. The prohibition in the statute, acts upon individuals as testators, and forbids them to make a devise to any corporation, not authorized to take by devise, in the manner and terms that the statute requires. The power of individuals to devise their lands, is the creature of positive law, and, as by the repeal of the statute in which it is given, it may be abrogated in tato, it is a necessary consequence, that its exercise may be modified and restricted at the pleasure of the legislature. It is true, that by the repeal or alteration of the statute of wills, the rights of a corporation, as they previously existed, may be incidentally affected, but they are affected not by an alteration of its charter, but by the change of a general municipal law. To make such changes is the province, and frequently the duty of the legislature; its power to make them is inherent and inalienable, and the rights of all persons, artificial as well as natural, corporations as well as individuals, are of necessity subject to its exercise. As to the actual intentions of the legislature, we are satisfied that the principal object of the alteration in the statute, which the revisers proposed, was to put an end to existing doubts as to the capacity of religious corporations, incorporated under the act of 1813, and previous acts on the same subject, to take by devise and these doubts were meant to be terminated by compelling courts of justice, so to construe these acts, as to exclude the possible implication that such an authority was given. This is rendered evident by the reference made by the revisers to the act of 1813, for they certainly never meant to say, as the counsel for the executors seem to have supposed, that this act, which in its terms is substantially the same as that of 1784, contains an express authority to religious corporations to take by devise ; their meaning was directly the reverse.\nLet it, however, be admitted that the validity of the devise in this case is not to be determined by a reference to the prohibition in the revised statutes, but that the sole inquiry is, whether the corporation, to which the devise is made, was authorized to take by devise, by the terms of the statute under which it was incorporated. Our opinion, then, is, that the question to which this inquiry leads can no longer be regarded as open. It is the settled construction of the act of 1\/784-, that the societies incorporated under it have no capacity to take by devise. Nearly half a century has elapsed since this construction was given to the act by the supreme court, in the case of Jackson v. Hammond, (2 Caines\u2019 Cases in Error 337,) and the authority of this decision, and the propriety of the construction which it sanctions, were most distinctly admitted by the court of errors, in McCartee v. The Orphan Asylum, (9 Cowen, pp. 508, 509.) Indeed it was partly upon the authority of Jackson v. Hammond, that the decree in McCartee v. The Orphan Asylum, appears to have been founded.\nNor shall we rest our opinion as to the true construction of the act of 1784, upon the mere authority of the cases to which we have referred ; for, although the reasoning of the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court in Jackson v. Hammond, is not quite satisfactory, of the correctness of the decision itself, we entertain no doubt. It was admitted upon the argument, that the general words in the third section of the act of 1784, by which religious societies, when incorporated, are empowered to have, take, receive, purchase and acquire, real estate; if construed without reference to other parts of the law, convey no authority to take by devise, so as to repeal, in regard to these corporations, the old exception in the statute of wills; but it was contended that the intention of the legislature, that these general words should be thus construed, is rendered apparent by the expressions used in the fourth section of the act, which contain, it was alleged, a distinct recognition of the capacity of the societies, meant to be incorporated, to take by devise, by declaring or admitting the validity of devises that had been previously made to them. It is, however, very clear to our minds, that the language in the fourth section, which is relied on, contains no suck declaration or admission; nor is it possible to believe, that the trainers of the law had any faith in the validity of devises which as made to unincorporated religious \u00a1societies, or to their use, were clearly void, both by the rules of the common law, and by the operation of the statutes of mortmain. Indeed, the very terms of the law reveal the conviction of its authors, that the previous yifK grants and devises, of which they speak, were, upon legal grounds, liable to he defeated. We. therefore, give our entire assent to the observations of Mr. Wood, that the design of the legislature, in the fourth section, was only to confirm the societies that might become incorporated under the act, in the possession and enjoyment of the lands and other property which they then held, without any regard to the nature or source of the title under which their possession was acquired. The legislature meant to remedy, so far as its power extended, existing defects of title, but did not mean, as the omission of the word \u201c devise,\u201d in the fifth section clearly shows, to relieve religious societies, when incorporated, from the exception of the statute of wills, by clothing them with a privilege and authority, which, for centuries past, the policy of the law had denied to all corporations.\nAs the devise to the trustees, &c., of the Methodist church must be declared illegal and void, we are next to consider what are the consequences of its invalidity. Has the real estate, which it embraces, descended to the heirs at law as in cases of intestacy? or must the trust which is annexed to the devise, be sustained as valid, and be carried into execution under such directions as the court may give ? The counsel for the executors contend, that the trust is valid as a charitable use, and that according to the established doctrine of equity, the disability of the trustee forms no impediment to its execution by the court, while on the other hand, the counsel for the heirs at law, not only deny that the trust is valid as a charitable or public use, but insist that the illegality of the devise, draws after it, as a necessary consequence, the invalidity of the trust, even were it true that if created in a different mode, its execution might be decreed. In our judgment, exactly the same questions arose in the case of McCartee v. The Orphan Asylum, and their decision was of necessity involved in the decree, wliicli the court of errors then pronounced. It may be thought very difficult to reconcile that decree* not only with the English cases, but with prior decisions in this state ; but till an opposite doctrine shall have been established by the court of appeals, we are bound to say that it has settled the law, that a devise to a corporation, not authorized by law to take by devise, if directly made, although clothed with a trust, is absolutely void, so that the property descends to the heir, not charged with the trust, hut as in a case of entire intestacy. The testator is judged to have died intestate as to all the property that the devise embraces. That such is the necessary effect of the decision of the court of errors, a few observations will render apparent.\nThe devise to the Orphan Asylum Society, which the court, in opposition to the opinion of the chancellor, held to be direct, and therefore void, was not general, so as to give to the society an unlimited power of disposition or application, but the will expressly directed that the property should be applied to the charitable purposes of the institution, that is, to the support and education of orphans. The devise, therefore, plainly and unequivocally created a trust; and as this trust was for purposes which the legislature, by incorporating the society, liad expressly authorized, no doubt could be raised, or indeed was suggested, as to its validity; hence the question, whether, although the devise was void, and the legal estate had descended to the heir, it was not the duty of a court of equity to effectuate the intention of the testator, by decreeing the execution of the trust, necessarily and distinctly arose; nor'is it possible that it could have escaped the attention of counsel or the observation of the court. We have the most abundant evidence that it did not escape such observation, but was thoroughly investigated and maturely considered. Chancellor Jones, in his elaborate opinion, (an opinion which there is no exaggeration in saying, displays almost un-equalled powers of reasoning and research,) after endeavoring to sustain the validity of the devise to the society, states the next question to be, whether upon the supposition that the devise was void in law, as being in effect a devise of land to a corporate body, it was not in the power of the court, as a court of equity, to effectuate the intention of the testator,\" (9 Cowen 409,) evidently meaning to effectuate bis intention by sustaining the trust and decreeing its execution. lie devotes nearly twenty pages of bis opinion to the examination of this question, and after a full review and careful analysis of the authorities, arrives at the conclusion, that the use to which the testator had devoted his estate, was valid as a charitable use, and the estate chargeable with it as a subsisting trust, and that as chancellor, he had power to establish the trust, and to decree the estate to be settled and conveyed to the uses of the will, (9 Cowen 483;) and, let it be remarked, that if he were justified in these conclusions, his decree, which directed a conveyance to the society to the uses of the will, ought never to have been reversed. It is true, that, the learned judge who delivered the opinion which prevailed in the court of errors, takes no notice of these positions of the chancellor, or of the arguments and authorities upon which they were rested; but as he could not have been ignorant that these positions had been taken, it is certain that lie and the majority who concurred with him, meant deliberately to reject them; otherwise the decree of the chancellor, although it might have been modified, could not have been wholly reversed, and the property have been permitted to descend to the heirs, discharged from the trust. It is impossible to explain the actual decision upon any other ground, than that in the judgment of the court, the devise was absolutely void in relation to the trust as well as the legal estate.\nWere it possible for us, however, to evade this conclusion, and escape by any means from the authority of this decision, we should still be compelled to say, that we have no \u2019power as a court of equity, to decree the execution of the particular trust which this will creates; we fully admit the general rule, that a trust is not to be defeated merely from the disability or failure of a trustee; but the rule is not to be applied, unless the court, in the exercise of its proper jurisdiction, may decree the execution of the trust. The trust that we are now required to execute, is a general indefinite charity, the persons to whose use and benefit the rents and profits are to be applied, not being designated with certainty in the will, but the selection being left to depend upon a future exercise of discretion. Hence, as from the illegality of the devise there is no trustee, so from the nature of the use there is no cestui que trust, and in England the rule is fully settled, that in such cases the disposition of the charity belongs to the king as fatrem patriae, and must be carried into execution under his sign manual, and not by the court of chancery, in the exercise of its ordinary and proper jurisdiction. It would be easy to cite numerous cases as proving the existence of the rale, but as all the preceding cases are reviewed and weighed by Lord Eldon in his elaborate opinion in the case of Moggridge v. Thackwell, it is needless to refer to any other authority. In that case his lordship states, as the result of a most diligent and searching examination, that the general principle most reconcilable to the cases, is, that where the purpose of the charity is general and indefinite, not fixing itself with certainty upon any object, the disposition is in the king by sign manual, and that the court will only take the administration of the trust where the execution is to be by a trustee. (7 Vesey, jr. 63 and 86; Carey v. Abbott, Ibid. 490.) Even in England, therefore, the present trust would be void in equity as well as at law, and could only be rendered effectual by the direct exercise of the royal prerogative. It is possible that the courts of equity in this state have succeeded to the powers and jurisdiction of the court of chancery in England, in regard to the execution and administration of charities, but we have yet to learn that, they have also succeeded to the prerogatives of the crown, or that there is any sovereign, whose directions, as given by his sign manual, they are bound to follow. It must also be remembered, that where the disposition of a charity belongs to the king, his majesty is not bound to follow the intentions of the testator, but that his discretion, in regard to the disposition of the property or fund, is unlimited and absolute. That courts of equity in this country have ever possessed or claimed a similar discretion, will not be pretended. Hence, even upon the supposition that we possess the same power as a court of chancery in England, to decree the execution of a charitable use, violating in its terms and in its duration, the general rules of law in relation to other trusts, we should still be bound to declare that the present trust, as well as the devise to which it is annexed, is illegal and void.\nThe observations that wo have made are not, however, to he construed as implying our assent to the positions that were so learnedly and ahly maintained hv the counsel tor the executors and the church, namely: that the law of charitable and pious uses as it prevailed in England anterior to the statute of Elizabeth, or independent of its provisions, (43 Eliz. c. 4,) was in force in this state, as a part of our common law, previous to the adoption of the revised staiut. s, and remains in furcia notwithstanding its entire inconsistency with the statutory provisions in relation to trusts and perpetuities. The authorities to which the counsel referred in support of his argument deserve great consideration and respect; but we cannot think them so conclusive as to preclude us from a free examination of the same questions, if hereafter it shall become our duty to consider and decide them. We shall not decide them in this case, since upon other grounds we are compelled to decide in favor of the heirs, and as a court, we decline to express or intimate any opinion in relation to them. Hence, although the form of this opinion will not be changed, the judge who delivers it is alone responsible for the observations that follow; they are to be considered as an explanation, which for special reasons it is deemed expedient to make, of the difficulties he will have to overcome before he can give his assent to a doctrine, which, in this and in a previous case, with much ability and an unusual display of learning, was pressed upon our adoption.\nWe strongly incline to think that the only law of charitable uses, which was in force in this state, on the 19th of April, 1775, as a part of that common law, which the constitution alone recognizes and adopts, was derived exclusively from the provisions of the statute of Elizabeth, and consequently when in 1788, that statute, together with all other English statutes, was repealed, the law was meant and understood to be wholly abrogated. Although we cannot refer to any positive evidence of the fact, we do not at all doubt that the statute of charitable uses, as the statute of Elizabeth is termed, was in force in this state when a colony, as a part of its common law, in the same manner and for the same reasons as the statute de donis, the statute of wills, the statute of frauds, the statutes of limitations, and many others, and indeed so far as the provisions of this statute were applicable to our condition as a colony, it is not merely a reasonable but a legal presumption that they were in fact adopted. (Dutton v. Howell, Show. P. C. 32; Atty. Genl. v. Stewart, 2 Mer. 159; Rex v. Vaughan, 4 Burr. 2500; Boehm v. Eagle, 1 Dallas, 15; Bogardus v. Trinity Church, 4 Paige, 193.)\nReasoning upon this fact, we find it very difficult to believe that the legislature in repealing the statute of Elizabeth, and in repealing at the same time the statutes of mortmain, (which there is certain evidence were also in force, Sec. 4, Act of 1784, Greenleaf, page 72,) meant to revive the equitable, or more properly, the clerical doctrine of pious and charitable uses, as it prevailed in England before the reformation, and during the prevalence of which, Lord Hardwicke says, (1 Vesey, 224.) the clergy and religious houses had contrived to possess themselves of nearly one-half of the whole real property of the kingdom. It is indeed difficult to believe that the legislature meant to revive and establish this doctrine, not in the modified and regulated form in which it now exists in England, but wholly freed from the numerous and salutary restrictions which the statutes of mortmain impose, and which the experience of every Christian nation, from the earliest ages of Christianity, liad shown to be demanded by imperative reasons of public policy ; yet it is to this conclusion that the arguments of counsel, and the authorities to which we have been referred, if we adopt and follow them, must of necessity lead us.\nIt is certain indeed, that such could not have been the intention of the legislature, if when the statute of Elizabeth was repealed, it was understood to be the true and only source of the law of charitable uses, and of the power of the court of chancery to compel their execution, and that at this time such was the actual belief of the legislature, and of its legal advisors, we think, for many reasons, it is hardly possible to doubt. All doubts upon this point, seem to be excluded when we remember that the belief which we attribute to the legislature, was until a very recent period, the general, if not universal opinion of the members of our profession, including the most eminent of our judges and jurists throughout the Union, and that this opinion was apparently justified by many decisions in the English courts, and by the positive dicta of several Lord Chancellors. (Gallego's Executors v. The Atty. Genl., 3 Leigh, 450; 2 Story Eq. Jur. 1154, 1158, 1162; 1 Ch. Ca. 134, 269; 6 Dow P. R. 136; Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, opinion Ch. J. Marshall 4 Wheat. 30 and 39: Baptist Association v. Smith, 3 Peters, App. 403, Mr. J. Story; Atty. Genl. v. Bowyer, 3 Vesey 744, Lord Loughborough; Mills v. Farmer, 1 Meriv. 551, Lord Eldon; 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 508, n.)\nUpon the supposition that charitable uses, as a distinct and peculiar class of trusts, were meant to be abolished, the conduct of the legislature in repealing and not re-enacting the statutes of mortmain, is readily explained, nor, as it appears to us, can it be explained in any way. We cannot suppose that the legislature meant to condemn and reject the policy upon which the statutes of mortmain are founded, a policy which the most enlightened statesmen and jurists have constantly approved, and the observance of which, the very nature of our institutions seems to demand. This policy, so far from having been abandoned, had been strictly adhered to and followed, in retaining the prohibition to corporations to take by devise, and in limiting the amount of the property that religious corporations are permitted to hold. The object of these provisions is exactly the same as that of the statutes of mortmain, namely to prevent real property from being locked up in perpetuity, and to save persons in extremis, from being led by false notions of merit or duty, so to dispose of their estates as to impoverish, perhaps leave an actual destitution, their families or dependent relatives, (4 Kent\u2019s Com. 507.) Nor for the attainment of these objects were any further restrictions necessary, if charitable uses when inconsistent with the general rules of law, were meant to be abolished; but if such uses were meant to be continued, the legislature could not have failed to see that the restrictions we have mentioned, were wholly insufficient to prevent the mischiefs they were designed to exclude. It could not have failed to see that in order to carry out and render effectual the policy it had adopted, devises to individual trustees for charitable uses and creating perpetuities, were just as necessary to be prohibited as devises to corporations, nor could its members and legal advisers have been ignorant that this necessary prohibition, was found in one of the statutes, (19 Geo. II. c. 36,) which they were then repealing. It is indeed evident, that the restraints laid upon corporations are practically of very little value, if every individual, by the creation of a trust, may devote bis whole estate, however large its amount, in perpetuity, to any use or purpose that lie may deem, or in the confusion and terror of a death-bed repentance, may be led to believe, is pious and charitable. A perpetual trust requires and implies a perpetual succession of trustees, and if we attend to things and not to words, we shall be forced to admit, that to create such a trust, is, in effect, to found a corporation, unlimited in its duration, and incapable of dissolution, having no power to alienate its property, yet unrestrained as to the amount it may hold. Hence it is scarcely possible to state or imagine a more strange and glaring inconsistency, than to prohibit corporations created by the legislature, from taking property by devise at ah, and to restrict, within jealous and narrow limits, the amount of the property that, by any means, they are permitted to acquire, yet, at the same time, to permit individuals in the unfettered exercise of their discretion, to devise all the property they may possess, whatever its amount, to corporations, which by the act of devising they create. Can we believe that the legislature, in repealing the statutes of mortmain, was intentionally guilty of this inconsistency ? Is it credible that it meant to counteract and defeat its own policy, and the long settled policy of our ancestors? That it meant to take away a restriction plainly necessary, which then existed, and for more than half a century, had been the law of the state, and by so doing, enlarge to a most impolitic extent, the discretionary power of individuals in the creation of charitable uses l The inference, it seems to us, is far more probable, that by the repeal of the statute ot Elizabeth, this discretionary power, when exercised in hostility to the general rules of law, was meant to be wholly abolished. The legislature could not surely have meant, by an extension of the power to create perpetuities, to increase indefinitely, the evils that are confessed to flow f|oni them ; its object, we are persuaded, was by an absolute denial of the power, to suppress those evils hi their source.\nIf, however, the opinion that we have now intimated, as to the intent and effect of the repeal of the statute of Elizabeth, shall hereafter appear to be erroneous, and we shall be ultimately persuaded that pious and charitable uses, indefinite in their nature, unlimited in their amount, locking up for ever the property which they embrace, and in other respects, wholly irreconcilable to the general rules by which other trusts are governed, were sanctioned by the law of this state, previous to the adoption of the revised statutes ; yet as such uses are most plainly and directly repugnant to the statutory provisions, in relation to trusts and perpetuities, we confess our present inability to understand or conceive, why they are not now to be considered as positively forbidden, and therefore abolished. That they are embraced within the terms of these statutory provisions, terms as explicit, as strong, and as comprehensive as the language can furnish, it is impossible to deny, and we yet remain to be convinced, that they are not just as certainly embraced within their spirit and policy. At any rate, to declare that they are not, and upon that ground to introduce an exception, which there is not the slightest evidence, was ever contemplated by the revisers or by the legislature, would seem to us, as at present advised, an unjustifiable, if not unexampled, stretch of judicial power. It is said that the revisers, in their notes, make no reference or allusion to charitable uses ; and it is assumed that they would not have been silent, had they meant to abolish them ; but it seems far more reasonable to say, that had they meant to except them from the universal terms of the enactments which they proposed, they would certainly have said so, since, had such been their intention, the necessity of a positive exception, in order to prevent misconstruction, could not possibly have escaped them ; on the other hand, if they meant not to except, but to include charitable uses, the explanation of their silence is easy and obvious. They may have deemed it unnecessary to speak; they may have thought that the provisions which they recommended spoke for themselves, in a language that neither the legislature nor judges qpuld fail to understand. The article in relation to uses and trusts commences with this declaration : \u201c Uses and trusts, except as authorized and modified in this article, are abolished,\u201d (1 R. S. 727, \u00a7 45,) and the addition of a note, telling the legislature that all uses and trusts, not excepted, were meant to be included, would have been an idle repetition of a text, which, if words have a meaning, could bear no other interpretation. Not only are uses and trusts abolished, but to exclude the supposition that any, previously existing, were meant to be preserved, it is declared, that none are to be excepted but those which the article itself authorizes and modifies ; and that by any comment upon such a text, the meaning of the revisers, and the duty of judges could have been rendered more plain and evident, we exceedingly doubt. Of this we feel assured, that had. the revisers intended to revive or continue in force the ancient doctrine of pious and charitable uses, as it practically existed in England during the ages of darkness and superstition, and subject to none of the restraints that constant evasion and successive abuses had shown to be necessary, and successive statutes of mortmain had imposed, they would not have been silent. Their views would not have been concealed from the legislature; but upon tin's, as upon all other occasions of importance, if not fully vindicated, would have been fully explained. Comparing their notes with the actual provisions in their text, the just inference seems to be, that they believed that charitable uses, as they then existed, were subject to the general rules of the common law, and, consequently, would be subject to the statutory rules which they desired to substitute. Whether this inference be just or not, our conviction remains, that charitable uses may possibly have been overlooked or forgotten, but certainly were not meant to be excepted.\nIt was urged upon the argument as a conclusive reason for excepting charitable uses from the general provisions of the revised statutes, that in England they are held not to be embraced within the general words of an act of parliament; but however broad and unlimited tbe terms of the statute, are uniformly treated as an exception which the law implies. In proof of this assertion, we were told that the exception in the statute of wills, (34 and 35 H. VIII. c. 5,) by its terms, renders every devise to a corporation void, whatever its intent or object; and yet a devise to a corporation for a charitable use, it has been frequently decided, as not within the statute, is valid. So, also, that the terms of the statute of uses (27 Hen. VIII. c. 10) are general, comprehending all uses ; and yet it has never been held nor supposed that, under the statute, a charitable use is or can be executed. Such uses are an admitted exception. To the argument drawn from the construction of the statute of wills, Ch. J. Marshall lias replied and we shall give the reply, without the addition of a word, in his own clear and forcible language. In the case of the Baptist Association v. Hart's Executors, (4 Wheat. 1,) it was alleged by the counsel for the plaintiffs, as a proof that charitable uses were not derived from the statute of Elizabeth, that before the passage of that act, it was held that a devise to a corporation for a charitable use, notwithstanding the exception in the statute of wills, was good in equity. It was in reply to this allegation that the chief justice, in delivering the judgmen t of the court, said, \u201c We think we cannot be mistaken when we say that no case was decided between the statute off Hen. VIII. (the statute of wills) and the statute of Elizabeth, in which a devise to a corporation was held good in equity. Such a decision would have overturned principles uniformly acknowledged in that court. The cases of devises that have been held good, were decided since the statute of Elizabeth on the principle that the latter statute, so far as relates to chanties, repeals the former.\u201d (4 Wheat. 40.) The language of Mr. J, Story, in the most instructive of his works, upon the same point, is just as explicit. \u201cDevises to corporations,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich are void under the statute of Henry VIII., are made good solely by the statute of Elizabeth; for it is plain that a devise, void by statute, cannot be made good upon any principle of general law\u201d (2 Story\u2019s Eg. Jur. 1152); a remark which, considering the subject to which it was applied, is equivalent to saying that where the words of a statute are general, there is no principle of law that can justify a court of justice in creating an exception that is not created by the statute itself.\nWe cannot here forbear from an observation that seems hitherto to have escaped the attention it deserves. If devises to a corporation for charitable uses, or in trust for a corporation for a similar use, (for it is only upon the same principle that even these have been held to be good, Attorney General v. Downing, Ambl. 550; Adlington v. Andrews, 3 Atk. 141,) are rendered valid in England solely by force of the statute of Elizabeth, it inevitably follows that with ns all such devises, since the repeal of that statute, must be v5id, even upon the supposition that a charity not inconsistent with the general rules of law, may still be created. The plain, unequivocal meaning of the decisions is, that it was competent to the legislature alone to except any class of devises from the operation and effect of the general words in the statute of wills ; and as the exception thus created no longer exists, it follows that those general words must now be understood in the full extent of their meaning, that but for the statute of Elizabeth would always have been given to them, that is, as rendering void every devise to a corporation, or in trust for a corporation, whatever may be its intent and purpose.\nAs to the argument drawn from the statute of uses, exactly the same reply, were it necessary, might he given, that if charitable uses are an exception from the general words of the statute, they are so only by force of the statute of Elizabeth. But, in truth, no such exception exists. Charitable uses are neither within the scope nor the words of the statute of uses. The only design of that statute was to convert equitable into legal estates, by annexing the legal title to the equitable right of possession, but the persons, for whose benefit a charity is created, have no estate or interest in the lands upon which the statute could possibly operate. They are mere beneficiaries, having the right, and nothing more than the right, to compel the performance of the trust, according to its terms, and the intentions of their benefactor. A valid charitable use must always remain, and can only be enforced, as a trust, unaffected by the provisions of the statute; since, considering it simply as a use, there is not, and never can be, any person in whom it can he executed. As the rents and profits are to be applied to the benefit of a succession of persons in perpetuity, there is not, and never can be, a cestui que trust to whom the legal estate, if that of the trustees is divested, can be given, without destroying the charity and defeating for ever the intentions of its founder.\nAs those that have now been stated were the only instances that were cited to prove that in England, it is an established rule of construction that charitable uses are not covered by the general words of a statute, we must be permitted to doubt, until more pertinent and conclusive evidence shall have been given, whether in the English courts the supposed rule has ever been admitted, or even suspected, to exist. We have ourselves been unable to discover the faintest trace of its existence, and until otherwise convinced, must continue to think, with Ch. J. Marshall, that a decision such as the rule would require to be made, would overturn principles that courts of equity as well as of law have uniformly acknowledged.\nWe do not at all share the apprehensions that have been expressed as to the consequences that may ensue, if that construction of the revised statutes shall be adopted, which our remarks have' implied to be necessary. The benevolence of Christian and other philanthropists will not he unduly restrained; an ample scope will still be left for its beneficent action. Charitable and public uses are not abolished by subjecting them to the provisions of the revised statutes. For these purposes, if the. alienation of the capital is not improperly restricted, donations and bequests of money may still be made to any amount, and the proceeds of real estate, directed to be sold, may be similarly applied. Practically, the principal effect will be found to be, that lands cannot be granted or devised so as to render them thereafter for ever inalienable, without the assent of the legislature, unless they are granted or devised to a corporation, that by law is authorized to take, and bound to retain them. The necessity of an appeal to the legislature, in other cases where perpetuities are sought to be created, we cannot regard as an evil. When a new and plainly meritorious charity \u215b meant to be founded, such as an hospital, an asylum, a library, a college, or a school, none of us can fear that the sanction of the legislature will ever be withheld ; nor will it be deemed a subject of just regret that when the aid of the legislature is required, it will have the opportunity of considering, whether the claims or fair expectations of wives, children, or relatives, have been overlooked and sacrificed. Under our present system, such as we suppose it to exist, and considering the restraints that are now laid upon corporations, their incapacity to take by devise, and the limited amount of property which they are permitted to hold, we need not the English statutes of mortmain; but revive the English doctrine of pious and charitable uses in its original extent, and the necessity of such statutes will soon be apparent. In this, as in every other country, where such uses have been suffered for a time to prevail, without restriction, there wall be an inundation of abuses, which the utmost power of the legislature will be required to stem, repel, and overcome.\nThere are some other considerations to which, as suggesting topics of useful reflection, it may be expedient to advert. If charitable and pious uses, without limitation or restraint, notwithstanding the repeal of the statute of Elizabeth, and notwithstanding the express provisions of the revised statutes, now constitute a part of our unwritten law, where shall we find, who shall declare to us, the rules by which they are to be governed ? How are they to be classed, limited, and defined ? What is a charitable ? what a pious use'? In England, charitable uses are enumerated and defined in the statute of Elizabeth, and it is settled, that none can be sustained as such, that the provisions of the statute may not be construed to embrace. (Brown v. Yeates, 7 Vesey 50 n; Morrice v. Bishop of Durham, 9 Vesey 30, S. C. 10 Ves. 523; Ommany v. Butcher, 1 Turn. & Russ. 260; Vesey v. Sampson, 1 Sim. & S. 69; 2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1155, 56, 57.) Hence, when the question arises, whether a particular use is valid as charitable, it is readily solved by a reference to the statute, and the decisions under it. But to us, as the statute is repealed, neither its terms, nor the decisions under it, can any longer furnish a guide, and either the whole subject must be committed to the uncontrolled and arbitrary discretion of judges, or every trust, that assumes the name and wears the form and face of charity, without discrimination, must be sustained. Benevolence is the most amiable of virtues, and more than any other commands our sympathy and applause; but more than any other it needs the aid of enlightened reflection, and the direction and control of a sound judgment; and, if the execution of every trust that a mistaken philanthropy may create, must be decreed, courts of equity will frequently discover, that instead of relieving distress, promoting industry, or assisting virtue, they are efficient agents in supporting the idle, encouraging the dissolute, and protecting the criminal.\nAs to pious uses, if any are to be sanctioned other than those which are included within the general object of religions corporations, the difficulties are still greater. In England, while pious uses are retained, those which have been branded as superstitious have been abolished, and none are deemed pious but such as are strictly consistent with the orthodox faith of Protestant Christians. But with us, it is plain, that no such distinction can be admitted. With us, as all religions are tolerated, and none is established, each has an equal right to the protection of the law; and, consequently, all uses directed to a religious object must be equally proscribed, or all must be upheld as pious, which are consecrated by the faitli of any description or class, not merely of Christians, but believers. Hence, if the Presbyterian and the Baptist, the Methodist and the Protestant Episcopalian, must each be allowed to devote the entire income of his real and personal estate, for ever, to the support of missions, or the spreading of the Bible, so must the Roman Catholic his, to the endowment of a monastery, or the founding of a perpetual mass for the safety of his soul; the Jew his, to the translation and publication of the Mishna or the Talmud, and the Mahommedan, (if in that colluvies gentium to which this city, like ancient Eonie, seems to be doomed, such shall be among us,) the Mahommedan his, to the assistance or relief of the annual pilgrims to Mecca.\nUpon the whole, we are certainly inclined to think that it is better that judges shall say, as it seems to us the legislature has said, that no use or trust can be valid that the revised statutes have not authorized, and that the absolute power of alienation, in respect both to real and personal estate, shall not be suspended for a longer period than the statutes allow, \u201c by any limitation or condition whatever.\u201d (1 R. S. \u00a7 15, p. 723 ; \u00a7 1, p. 773.) These rules, as general, we believe are safe and salutary, and when in special cases they need to be relaxed, the legislature has the power to relax them. That power has already, in many eases, been wisely and beneficially exercised. (Laws 1840, ch. 318, \u00a7 1, 2, 3, 4; Laws 1841, ch. 261; Laws 1839, ch. 174, \u00a7 1, 2, 3; Laws 1839, ch. 184, 2 R. S. 3d ed. pp. 23, 24, 25.)\nAnd let it be remembered, that by its exercise, the legislature lias virtually adopted that construction of the statutes which we have supposed that their terms necessarily import. And that the revisers, by incorporating the provisions of the acts to which we refer, in a separate article, in the title relative to the nature and qualities of estates in real property, have clearly shown that they regarded them as exceptions to the general rules which that title was meant to establish. (2 R. S. 3d ed. p. 23.)\nWe shall not pursue remarks which, although they are far from having exhausted a subject of wide extent and deep interest, have led us further than we intended, but shall proceed to state briefly the result of our opinion. As we have declared that the devise to the trustees of the Methodist church, and the trust annexed to it, are illegal and void, it is a necessary consequence that the direction to the executors to accumulate the residue of the personal, and the rents and profits of the real estate, for the purpose of building a house upon the lot in Brooklyn, cannot be supported. That direction could only have been sustained as ancillary to the principal trust, and therefore a con stituent part of a valid charitable use. Separated from the trust, it is clearly void, not only from the failure of its object, but as directing an accumulation for a purpose not authorized by law, and as involving an indefinite suspense of the power of alienation.\nA decree must be entered in conformity to the views we have expressed, declaring that the devise of the lots in New York and Brooklyn, is absolutely void, and that the property devised has descended to the heirs at law as in a case of entire intestacy; also that the next of kin and heirs at law are entitled to the accumulated fund in the hands of the executors, directing a reference to a suitable person to take the accounts and to ascertain and report who are entitled to take as next of kin and heirs at law, and in what proportions, and reserving all further directions until the coming in of the report. The taxable costs of all the parties, and the reasonable counsel fees of the executors, are to be paid out of the funds in their hands, and as they have acted in good faith, they are also to be allowed the usual commissions upon the sums received and expended by them, including those arising from the real estate.\n(a)\nAnte, page 242.\n(a)\nIt is, however, made perfectly certain by the publications of the English Record Commission, since the decision in 4 Wheaton 1, that the learned and venerable chief justice was wrong in this statement. This is conceded by Story, J., delivering tho opinion of the court in the Girard will case, 2 Howard\u2019s U. S. Rep. 192 to 196, and is abundantly shown in Mr. Binney\u2019s argument in that case, at pages 146, 155 to 161, note. See a contrary view of the points at page 179, note to the argument of Mr. Cadwallader, for the plaintiff.

She was an illegitimate. The Public Administrator now applies for letters of administration; and a similar application is made by Bichard Hughes, a lawful son of Mary Ann Hughes, the mother of the intestate. The basis of my jurisdiction in the matter, rests on the fact that the deceased died possessed of assets in this State.\nThe rule is now well established, that while the grant of administration follows the law of the place where the estate is to be administered, the distribution of the property is governed by the law of the domicil of the deceased. In what place distribution is to be made, whether the estate is to be collected here, and then remitted to the foreign administrator in bulk to be administered by him, or whether creditors and distributees here, can have their claims and shares paid.here, before the fund is sent abroad, depends upon a variety of circumstances, and must be determined in the exercise of a sound discretion by the Judge, in consonance with certain general rules, but in subjection to the peculiar features of each particular case. But whether administered here, wholly or jtartially, the rule which governs the distribution to the next of kin, is the lex dormcilii. (Williams on Executors, 1301, cmd cases cited m note f.)\nOur statute gives administration to the next of kin of the deceased, who would be entitled to succeed to his personal estate, and requires, therefore, that the applicant for letters not only should be a relative, but a relative entitled to a distributive share. To find who are entitled to succeed to the personal estate of a person domiciled j^broad, it is incumbent upon me, consequently^i\u00bb\u00ab\u00bf^^^mret\u00f3he law of the place of his domicil. jy f\nEmma Hughes was domiciled in ^ngfand; beings illegitimate, nullAus filia, she had no innm|g!$e Wood ; aim being unmarried, no lawful kindred. fSne could h|^ np legal kindred, except lineal descendant; \u2019\u00a3]\u00bffcih\u00a7'mo lei^fil ancestors, she could have no collateral relatives (Colvin vs. Proc. General, 1 Hagg., 92.) By the law ofjEngland, therefore, Bichard Hughes had no right to a distributive share in the estate of the deceased, and consequently cannot be entitled to letters of administration here.\nBut the question naturally arises, what becomes of this estate % There is an absolute obstruction of the course of succession. In such a case it was formerly held (Salk., 37) that the Ordinary could seize the goods of the intestate, and dispose of them m pios usus, but it now seems the King is entitled to them as ultmrms Imres, subject to the payment of the debts (Megit vs. Johnson, 2 Doug., 548); but it has become the practice to grant letters patent, transferring the right of the crown, with a reservation of a tenth, or some other charge; and the grantee of course takes administration. (Williams on Executors, 357; Jones vs. Goodchild, 3 P. Wms., 33; Rutherford vs. Maule, 4 Hagg., 215; State vs. Tyndall, 2 Cas. Temp., Lee, 394; Taylor vs. Haygarth, 14 Simon., 8; Cave vs. Roberts, 8 Simon., 215.)\nI do not understand, however, that the goods of an intestate who leaves no relatives, go to the crown by virtue of any title. The case is by no means analogous to that of real estate, where the blood of the person last seized being extinct, and the inheritance having failed, the land becomes feuctum aperivm, and reverts back to the King, as the original owner, grantor and Lord of the fee. The escheat is thus worked out through the medium of the original right of domain, the reversion of the primary title. (Black. Com., Lib. 2, c. 15.) With goods, however, it was otherwise. \u201c Whatever moveables are found upon the surface of the earth,\u201d says Blackstone (Gom., Lib. 2, c. 26), \u201c or in the sea, and are unclaimed by any owner, are supposed to be abandoned by the last proprietor, and as such, are returned into the common stock and mass of things, and therefore, they belong, as in a state of nature, to the first occupant or fortunate finder.\u201d Even waifs, treasure trove, and estrays, which in progress of time became the property of the King, were originally the property of the finder, but for the purposes of peace and order, they ultimately became rights annexed to the Supreme Power. \u201c JETcec quae nulUusm bonis swit, * * * et quae olimfuerwni vnvmtoris dejwre natwrdli, jam effcvumtu\/rpri\/ncipis dejwre \u25a0 gentium.\u201d (Bracton, L. 1, c. 12.) This nevertheless, as to vacant goods, was a matter of prerogative, not of derivative title. Indeed, the very groundwork of an administration of the property of an intestate,, consists in the fact that there is a failure of title, and his assets have become bona vaccmtia. (Hensloe\u2019s Case, 9 Reports, 37, 38.) The King, therefore, seized upon his goods as the parens patriae, and general trustee of the kingdom, and the right to administer at first deputed to the Prelates of the Church, and afterwards transferred to the relatives of the deceased, is in truth based upon this very prerogative of seizing upon va-. cant goods. The rule to which I have already adverted, that the grant of administration follows the lex loci rei sitae, is at once an illustration and proof of this position. It follows, that the right of the crown,-\u2014-flowing not from a derivative title from the last owner,, but from the fact of a failure of all title and the want of an owner, whereby the \u2022 goods are vacant,\u2014can only be exercised upon moveables within the kingdom. The sovereign has not, of course, the power to seize upon assets within the territory of another independent sovereignty. There is neither the ooeasion nor the means of exercising such a prerogative; not the means, beause his laws have no extra-territorial operation, and not the occasion, because the assets to be seized are not bona vacantia within the limits of his power, but on the contrary, are in another country and under another jurisdiction. In the case of the American subject, who died in England m itinere (Aspinwall vs. The King's Proctor, 2 Curteis, 246), the interesting point involved in the matter now before me, was slightly adverted to. The Court thought, that the government of the country in which the property was found, \u201c has a right to the custody of the property till a superior title to it can be shown,\u201d but at the same time it was intimated, that if it could be shown that the intestate died without relations, and the property had devolved upon the American Government, \u201cthe Court would be inclined to grant letters of administration to the Consul.\u201d The case of Sidy Hamet Benamor Beggia, 1 Add., 340, was referred to, where the deceased, who had been Consul of the Emperor of Morocco, at Gibraltar, died at that place, without leaving any proper heir by the Mahomedan Law, and administration was decreed to a party specifically empowered to take it, on behalf of the Emperor. Sir Herbert Jenner justly observes of this decision, that the Emperor \u00f3f Morocco \u201c claimed, not the custody of the property, but the interest itself; the jus in re was in him.\u201d I may also add as a point worthy of remark, that the deceased was a public functionary, resident at Gibraltar only in a Consular capacity, and that proof was exhibited to the Court of the Emperor\u2019s title to the deceased\u2019s effects in behalf of the national treasury, by the Mahomedan Law.\nI do not find, however, any case which has carried the fiction that mobilia segwwnt\/wr personam, to such an extent, as by an imaginative process to suppose the effects, which are in fact in Hew-York, to be in England, for the sake of subjecting them to an imaginative seizure there, for the benefit of the King. The lex domicilii prevails only by the comity of nations, and not by any intrinsic force, or gyr&prio vigore. (2 Kent's Com., 406; Wheaton's Inter, law, 134\u20145,6. Sub. 2. 4 Kent, 423\u20145.) It seems to be the universal law of all nations, that the moveables of an intestate accrue to the State within whose territory they are found, subject only to such a rule of distribution as maybe adopted by that sovereignty. It has become a settled principle among civilized nations, to substitute for the domestic rule of distribution, or rather adopt in its place, the law of distribution which prevails in the country where the deceased was domiciled. But does this principle run any further ? When, according to the domestic statute of distributions, there is a failure of distributees, the property remains in the State for want of claimants ; when, according to the foreign law of distribution, there is a failure of distributees, why should not the State in this case as well as in the other, continue to hold the property for want of claimants ? In the present case, Emma Hughes left no person who could demand the estate according to the laws of England, her place of domicil; and even the crown would have no title to it, were it in fact in that jurisdiction, except from an entire failure of all relatives of the deceased,\u2014the absence of any one having any title. This kind of negative title, based on no intrinsic, vital, or affirmative right, but growing out of an utter absence of any person capable of asserting- a claim; not composing a part of the law of distribution prevailing in the domicil, but being an appendage of sovereingty; not indeed the result of any positive law, but the incident of possession without accountability, I feel strongly inclined to consider, not such a part of the lex domicilii, as should prevail over the lex loci.\nIf the crown, however, have any rights in this case, the claim is not represented before me. Applications for grants in such instances are addressed to the \u201c liberality of the crown\u201d (4 Hagg., 213), and it is usual to take security from the grantees, \u201c to refund in case any person should appear and make good their claim as relations, or under a will, for in either case the crown would he a mere trustee for them.\u20195 There is a regular proceeding for procuring such a grant (Hubback's Ev. of Succession, 74, 78), and though expensive and burdensome, it would not be proper for me, if the English Government has any title, to anticipate to whom the grant would be made, or upon what reservations, or to dispense with the guaranties always taken in England for the protection of possible future claimants. Besides, it is not necessary for the purpose of adjudicating upon the application of Bichard Hughes, to determine at this stage of the case, whether the effects will ultimately belong to the British Government or to the State of Hew-York. I have said enough to indicate, that, in my opinion, the question is at least not free from doubt, and involving as it does a principle of grave moment, I do not now feel inclined to decide it, when the decision is not necessary for present purposes. For it makes no difference to Bichard Hughes, in his present application for letters of administration, whether the surplus shall ultimately go to the State or to the crown. It is enough that it will not come to him, that he has no interest in it by the law as it now stands.\nIt is insisted, however, in favor of his right to administer, that there being no one entitled to a distributive share of this estate in England, it ought to be distributed according to our law. 1 cannot see how this is possible. Had Emma Hughes been domiciled here, her estate would have been distributed according to our law. Formerly, the property of an illegitimate, who died intestate, unmarried and without descendants, passed to the State. By the Act of 1845 (Loads 1845, c. 236), it was provided, that \u201c it the deceased shall have been an illegitimate, and have left , a mother, and no child, or descendant, or widow, such mother shall take the whole surplus, and shall be entitled to letters of administration in exclusion of all other persons ; and if the mother of such deceased shall be dead, the relatives of the deceased on the part of the mother, shall take in the same manner as if the deceased had been legitimate, and be entitled to letters of administration in the same order.\u201d At the time of the death of Emma Hughes, her mother, Mary Ann Hughes, was dead, and if the Act of 1845 governs, then Richard Hughes, the son of Mary Ann Hughes, would be entitled to administration and distribution, the same as if Emma Hughes had been legitimate; I do not, however, think the Act of 1845, at all applicable to the case; it is, like the Statute of Distributions, of which it is an amendment, intended to apply only to intestates domiciled in this State. I do not see how there can be two rules of distribution; if we take the one, We must reject the other. Having once adopted the principle, that the property of an intestate is to be distributed according to the law of his domicil, and having ascertained by that law, that there is an obstruction in the line of succession, and an entire failure of relatives, it would be inconsistent to turn around and adopt a new rule. The presumption is, that the Act of 1845, which is a graft upon the Statute of Distributions, was not intended by the Legislature to affect the law of domicil now universally recognized by all civilized nations in cases of intestacy. An invasion of that rule has never been sustained in favor of the relatives of a legitimate, and the relatives of an illegitimate ought not to be placed in any better position. In fact it is a part of the lex loei, that distribution is to be made according to the lex domicilii, and if by the lex do-. '\/moili\u00c1, no one is entitled to succeed, then by the lex loci, .no one is entitled to succeed.\/ The property passes to the I State. The State may, from comity, admit the claim of a foreign government to it, or may make a grant of it to individuals here; but the same claims upon the liberality of the government might not be thought to exist in this instance, as in the case of an illegitimate resident; and I in any event, it is not for me to conjecture what the policy | of the State should or might be ; it is quite enough that it (has not been declared.\nIf this conclusion he correct, it follows that Richard Hughes has no interest in the estate, and in consonance with my previous determination on that point, having no interest, he is not entitled to letters in preference to the Public Administrator."},{"case_name":"William Wheeler, Appellant, v.

After making a number of specific bequests, the testator declares, \u2014 \u201c The residue of my estate is left in trust of Hugh Smith, Robert I. Taylor, and Phineas Janney, for such purposes as they consider promises to to be most beneficial to the town and trade of Alexandria. If any difficulty occurs in construction as to any of my bequests, R. I. Taylor is especially charged to give said construction.\u201d Smith, Taylor, and Jan\u00fcey were appointed executors.\nIn a codicil the testator declares, \u2014 \u201cNow in the inclosure I leave the residue of my estate, after payipg all bequests and appropriations, to some disposition thereof which my executors m\u00e1y consider as promising most to benefit the town and trade of Alexandria. Now I leave the same entirely to their disposition of it, in such manner as appears to them promises to yield the greatest good.\u201d\nThe complainant, William Wheeler, is next of kin and heir at law to the testqtor.. \u25a0 He filed his bill to set aside the. above devise, and also the compromise he made with the executors, under the impression that the devise was valid.\nOn reading the above residuary disposition of his estate, we cannot but observe the fact, that the testator had no settled purpose as to the mode of applying his bequest to \u201c benefit the town and trade of Alexandria.\u201d The town and trade of any commercial city are closely connected, and whatever shall benefit the one will advance the interest of the other. These interests are inseparably blended; but they were treated by the testator as distinct objects of his solicitude and bounty. Perhaps no matter could give rise to a greater diversity of opinion, than that which is involved in this devise.. Shall the objects of the testator be most advanced by extending the lines of internal communication connected with the town, such as turnpike roads, railroads, or canals; or by improving and extending the wharves and warehouses of the city; or by deepening the harbour and removing obstructions to navigation; or by loaning the capital to men engaged in commerce,- .or by aiding some other enterprise beneficial to the trade and town ? Shall the bounty be limited to Our own citizens, if foreigners shall do more than they, to carry out the expressed objects of the testator ?\nUnder this devise, how can a court of chancery correct an abuse of the trust ? By what means shall it ascertain the misapplication of the fund ? There is nothing to restrain the discretion of the trustees, or to guide the judgment of the court. If the trust can be administered, it must be administered at-the will of the trustees, substantially free from all legal obligation.\nBut before we pronounce on the character of this trust, it is important to know by what law it >is governed. Is the common law of England in relation to charities, as modified and enlarged by the statute of the 43d of Elizabeth, in force in Virginia? Charities have been administered, both at common law and in chancery, from an early period of English jurisprudence. But the \u2022 earlier decisions in that country are often inconsistent, and of no great weight of authority. The prerogative of the king was invoked as parens patriae where the charity was indefinite, arid a most liberal construction was given to the act of the 43d of Elizabeth; and under these influences a system has grown up in England favorable to the policy of charitable bequests. So far has this policy been carried, that wh\u00e9re the devise has been uncertain or impracticable, it has been sustained in some instances by what was supposed to be. the intent of the testator, or by approaching as near to it as practicable.\nIt would seem from the preamble to the statute of Elizabeth,that its object was mainly to institute a remedy where the charitable intent of the founders had not been carried out, by reason of frauds, breaches of trust, and negligence in those that should pay, <fcc. All the objects specified in that statute are denominated charities, though they embrace \u201c the repairing of bridges, ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks, highways,\u201d <fcc. There are some cases of charity, from their nature, though not specified in the statute.\nWhether .this policy has been wisely cherished by the English government is not a matter for our consideration. Charitable bequests, from their nature, receive almost universal commendation. But when we look into the history of charities in England, and see the gross abuses which have grown out of their administration, notwithstanding the enlarged powers of the courts, aided by the prerogative of the sovereign and the legislation of Parliament,' doubts may be entertained whether they have, upon the whole, advanced the public good.\nWhen this country achieved its independence, the prerogatives of the crown devolved upon the people of the States. And this power still remains with them, except so far as they have delegated a portion of it to the Federal government. The sovereign will is made known to us by legislative enactment. And to filis we must look in our judicial action, instead of the prerogatives of the crown. The State, as a sovereign, is the parens patrice.\nThe common law, it is said, we bro\u00faght with us from the mother country, and which we claim as a most valuable heritage. This is admitted, but not to the extent sometimes urged. The common law, in all its diversities, has not been adopted by any one of the States. In some of them it has been modified by statutes, in others by usage. And from this it appears that what may be the common law of one State is not necessarily the common law of any other. We must ascertain the common law of each State by its general policy, the usages sanctioned by its courts,' and its statutes! And there is no subject' of judicial action which requires the exercise of this discrimination .more than the administration of charities. No branch of jurisprudence is more dependent than this upon the forms and principles of the common law.\nIn this view, we must look to the laws of Virginia as governing this bequest. Alexandria was ceded to the Union by Virginia in 1801, but the laws of that State, as they then existed,\u2019 remained in force over the ceded territory. It has since-been retroceded to Virginia. By an act of the Virginia Legislature in 1789, followed'by orie in -1790, a commission was appointed on English statutes, and in the act of 1792 all English statutes then in force were declared to be repealed ; \u201c th\u00e9 Legislature reciting that, at that session, it had specially enacted such of them as appeared worthy of adoption.\u201d The statute of the 43d of Elizabeth, if it ever was in force in Virginia; was repealed by the above act.\nSome of the principles applicable to this case were considered by this court, in the Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 4 Wheat. 1. Hart, a citizen of Virginia, made his will, which contained the following bequest: \u2014 \u201c Item, what shall remain of my military certificates at the time of my decease, both principal and interest, I give and bequeathe to- the Baptist Association that for ordinary meet at Philadelphia annually, which I allow to be a perpetual fund for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination, who shall appear promising for the min-, istry, always giving a preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s family.\u201d Ip-that case, the court held that \u201ccharitable bequests, where no legal interest is vested, and which are too vp.gue to be claimed by those for whom the beneficial interest was intended, cannot be' established by a court of equity, either exercising its ordinary jurisdiction, or enforcing the prerogative of the king as parens patriae, independent of the statute 43d Elizabeth.\u201d And it was said'the statute of 43d Elizabeth had been repealed in Virginia.\n' In the cas\u00e9 of Gallego\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v. The Attorney-General, 3 Leigh, 450, the court held that \u201c the English statute of charitable uses, 43 Elizabeth, having been repealed in Virginia, the courts of chancery have no jurisdiction to decree charities where the objects are indefinite and uncertain.\u201d\n\u201c If a trust be created in a party, but the terms by which it is created are so vague and indefinite that courts of equity cannot clearly ascertain either its objects or the persons who are to take, then the trust will be held entirely to fail, and the property will fall into\" the general funds of the author of the trust.\u201d Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., $ 979, a. \u201c So, where a testatrix bequeathed the residue of her estate to her executors, \u2018 upon trust to dispose of the same at such times,- and in such manner, and for such Uses and purposes, as they shall think fit, it being my will that the distribution thereof shall be left to their discretion,\u2019 \u201d it was held to be void for uncertainty. Ibid., <\u00a7> 979, 6.\nIn Wright v. Atkyns, 1 Turn. & Russ. 157, Lord Eldon said, that in order to determine whether a trust of this sort is a trust which a court of equity, will interfere with, it is matter-of observation, first, that the words should be imperative ; secondly,, that the subject must be certain; and thirdly, that the object must be as certainias the subject. This principle is .also strongly illustrated in the case of Wood v. Cox, 2 Mylne & Craig, 684; 10 Leigh, 147.\nIn Morice v. The Bishop of Durham, 10 Ves. 521, where a bequest \u201cin trust for such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his own discretion shall most approve, cannot be supported as a charitable legacy; and is therefore a trust for the next of kin.\u201d This was under the statute of 43d Elizabeth. The court said, \u201c The trust must be of such a nature that the administration of it can be reviewed by the court; or if the trustee die, the court itself can execute the trust.\u201d And the court remark, in regard to the case before them, \u201c The trustee takes not for his own benefit, but for purposes not sufficiently defined to be controlled and managed by this court.\u201d\nThe case of Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 How. 127, was decided under the law of Pennsylvania. The court say, \u201c It has been decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that the conservative principles of the statute of Elizabeth have been in force in Pennsylvania by common usage and constitutional recognition.\u201d\nIn a late case in Virginia, not yet reported, of Brand\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Brand et al., the following devise was held to be void: \u2014 \u201c Third, I give to the Rev. W. J. Plummer, D. D., the residue of my estate, both real and personal, in trust for the board of publication of the Presbyterian Church in the United States.\u201d\nFrom the principles laid down in the above cases, it is clear that the devise under consideration cannot be sustained. A trust is vested in the executors, but the beneficiaries of the trust are uncertain, and the mode of applying the bounty is indefinite. It is argued that the testator intended to give to the town of Alexandria, in its corporate capacity, the residuum of his estate. But. he did not so express himself. On the contrary, it clearly appears that the executors were made the repositories of his confidence, and the only persons who were authorized to administer the trust. The cestui que trusts were the- town and the trade of the town. It would be difficult to express in more indefinite language the beneficiaries of a trust. How can a court of chancery administer this trust. On what ground can it remove the trustees for an abuse of it. The discretion of the trustees may be exercised without limitation, excepting that the fund must be applied for the benefit of the trade and town of Alexandria. And if the application of the fund be, however remotely, connected with the objects of the trust, the judgment of the court could not be substituted for the discretion of the trustees.' It is doubtful whether so vague a bequest could be sustained under the 43d of Elizabeth. Without the application of the doctrine of cy-pres, it could not be carried into effect. In Virginia charitable bequests stand upon the same footing as other trusts, and consequently require the same certainty as to the objects of the trust and the mode of its administration.\nBut the defendants insist, that the right of the complainant \u2022was compromised and finally settled, which is shown by a Writing under seal, and under which they paid to him twenty-five thousand dollars. The complainant prays that this agreement may be set aside as inoperative and void.\nIt appears from the bill, that the complainant resides in the State of Pennsylvania, and that so soon as he could raise the means of paying his expenses, after he heard of the death of his uncle, he came to Alexandria. He had an interview with the executors, and stated to them his determination to test the validity of 'the will, so soon as he' should be able to employ counsel. This was before the probate of the will. Mr. Smith, one of the executors, expressing great kindness for him, was anxious to avoid a lawsuit. He did- not fear the result, as the executors had been advised by counsel in whom they had confidence, that the will was valid. He represented the vexations, delays, and expenses of a lawsuit, and intimated to the complainant that the executors were, willing to pay a sum of money to him if the matter could be compromised.\nIt appears that the complainant had been prodigal in his expenditures, and that, notwithstanding the provisions for his support which had been made for him by his uncle, he was without means and embarrassed. When the interview took place' which led to the compromise, the complainant again expressed his conviction that the will was not valid, \u00e1nd declared that he should try its validity by legal proceedings. Mr. Taylor, one'of the executors, was a distinguished, lawyer, a man of high standing, and in whom the complainant reposed the greatest confidence; he represented to the complainant that he had sundry written opinions of counsel in favor of the legal validity of the residuary devise, which- he offered to show to him.' His conversation conveyed to the complainant \u201c the clear and distinct impression, that there was but one opinion among the lawyers consulted, and that they were unanimous in favor of the validity of the devise.\u201d The complainant asked Mr. Taylor to state his opinion on the subject. He observed, that the complainant should not have asked him, but his opinion was, \u201c that the devise in question was a legal and valid disposition of the residue of the estate.\u201d At the same time, he admitted that in Pennsylvania such a devise would not be good ; but that it was good under the old law of Virginia.\nThe complainant alleges that he had no settled views of the legal question, and being disheartened by the circumstances under which he was placed, he yielded to the compromise. He had but little time for reflection, and none to advise with counsel; and at last he came to the conclusion to consider the devise valid, and take what he could get for a release.\nUnder these circumstances, the complainant agreed to the compromise. It stated the residuary devise, and that its validity had been controverted by the complainant. That \u201c.the said executors, taking on themselves the burden of the execution of said will, and of the trusts aforesaid, and the said William Wheeler, to avoid the delay and expense of litigation, and finally to settle and adjust all doubts' and difficulties which might arise on the effect of said will, so as to leave the said executors to execute the same without delay or impediment, have agreed on the following terms of compromise.\u201d\n1st. That twenty-five thousand dollars shall be paid to the complainant. 2d. That the executors shall release to him all claims to any property, real or personal; conveyed or settled on complainant by the testator in his lifetime. 3d. That the complainant shall release to the executors \u201c all his claims, in law or equity, to the estate, real and personal, devised and bequeathed, or intended to be devised or bequeathed, by the said Charles Bennett by his said will, to be held and disposed of by the said executors in the manner in and. by the said will prescribed. And that the said executors shall be at liberty, if any specification of the objects to which the residuary fund is to be applied be thought necessary, to apply the same to aid in finishing the Alexandria Canal, &c., and to subscribe to any railroad or other roads communicating with the said town; to anymr to all of the above purposes, in such way as the said executors, or the survivors, may think most conducive to the prosperity and welfare of the town,\u201d <fcc.\nThe complainant, it seems, had studied law, but it is manifest from the facts before us, that he was but little acquainted with business, was an inefficient and dependent man, easily misled, especially by those for whose abilities and characters he entertained a profound respect. From the high character of the executors, no one can impute to them any fraudulent intent in this'transaction.'; Looking to what they considered to be the object of the testator, they felt themselves authorized, if not bound, to effectuate his purposes by making this compromise with his heir'at law. They had no personal interest beyond that which was common to the citizens of Alexandria. And we admit that they may have acted under a sense of duty, from a misconception of their power under the 'will.\nBut in making the- compromise, the parties did not stand on \u00e9qual ground. The necessities and character of the complainant were well known.to the executors'. Having the confi denee expressed in the validity of the devise, they could hardly have felt themselves authorized to pay to the complainant twenty-five thousand dollars for the relinquishment of a pret\u00e9nded right. Nor could they have deemed .it necessary, in the agreement of compromise, substantially to constitute him the donor of the munificent bequest to the town and trade of Alexandria.\nWe are to judge of this compromise by what is stated in the bill, the facts being admitted by the demurrer. And it appears to us that the agreement, under the circumstances, is void. -It' cannot be sustained on principles which lie at the foundation of \u00e1 valid contract. The influences operating upon the mind of the complainant induced him to sacrifice his interests. He did not act freely, and with a proper understanding of his rights.\nThe decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, the demurrer overruled, and the' cause remanded for further proceedings.\nOrder.\nThis cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the County of Alexandria, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court,, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that this cause be, and the same ,is hereby, remanded, for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity to the opinion of this court."},{"case_name":"Heirs of Stephen Henderson v. P. A. Rost et al. Exec\u2019s","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4890026\/","date":"1850-05-01","court":"Louisiana Supreme Court","content":"The judgment of the court (Rost, J. recusing himself on account of interest,) was pronounced by\nSlidell, J.\nIn the first article of the will the testator names three persons as his testamentary executors. In the second, he directs that in the event of their absence, resignation, or death, their places are-to be filled by one or two commissioners to be appointed by the Governor of the State, and any one of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Judge of the First Judicial District Court, or any two of them. The commissioners are to have a yearly salary of fifteen hundred dollars each; they may be dismissed by any two of the judges for criminal conduct; they are to keep a set of books, to be examined and approved annually by any two of the judges. In the third article, he directs that his estate is not to go into court except for the purpose of probating the wills, and that every thing belonging to his estate is to be continued and conducted as it may be found at liis death. He orders the executors or commissioners to keep on each of his plantations a skilful and humane superintendant. He gives instructions for the food, treatment and discipline of the negroes. In the sixth, seventh and eight articles, he directs the gradual liberation of his slaves. In the ninth, he says: \u201cThe Destrehan estate is to remain forever asa part of my succession; and at the end of twenty-five years from my death, it must be laid out into a city to be named Destrehan.\u201d In the tenth, he says : \u201cFour acres, including the back and front garden, running back with parallel lines to the lakes, with all the dwellings, are to remain as one lot, with a good street and buildings on each side of the street.\u201d In the eleventh, he says: \u201cAll my real estate in the city to remain upon ground rent, and no lease to exceed twenty-five years in time. All the stocks to be sold in ten years from my death.\u201d\nIn the twelfth article, he bequeaths to his brother John Henderson, or his heirs, if he be dead, two thousand dollars per annum ; a like amount to Ann Henderson or her heirs, to Stephen Henderson or his heirs, to the children of George Henderson or his heirs; two thousand- dollars annually to the poor of New Orleans, to be distributed by persons appointed for that purpose by the governor, &c.; two thousand dollars per annum to the poor of Dunblane, in North Britain.\nIn the thirteenth article he says: \u201c When funds can be spared after twenty years, I wish a large manufactory of negro shoes and coarse clothes to be erected at Destrehan, under the direction of experienced workmen from Scotland. Destrehan city must be incorporated by an act of the Legislature. If these manufactories are well conducted, it will be the means of doing much good to the country, and give employment to a great many of the poor, and it will no doubt be the means of stimulating a great many of the young men to exert themselves, because, by perseverance and industry, they see what can be done.\u201d\nIn the fourteenth article he directs \u201cthat after the first five years the executors will divide the following sums amongst the four following congregations, say, Clapp\u2019s Church, two thousand dollars; Catholic Cathedrel, two thousand dollars; the English Church on Canal street, two thousand dollars; and the church commenced by Maffit, two thousand dollars; and to the Orphan Boys, two thousand dollars; and to the Female Orphan Society, tofo thousand dollars; the legacies to the four churches is only to remain and be payable for five years, but all the others so far named are .to be perpetual. Two thousand dollars per annum to the Charity Hospital. Five hundred dollars per annum to the Firemen\u2019s funds.\u201d\nIn the -fifteenth article he says: \u201c I wish a chapel or church to be erected \u25a0upon the upper corner of the four acres lot, and a Presbyterian minister to be sent for from Dunblane or its neighborhood, at a moderate salary; I also -wish a good house for the minister to be erected upon the lower corner of the four acres lot; there must also be a small house for the education of. the poor of the town, over which the minister must preside.\u201d\nIn the seventeenth, he changes the name of the proposed city from Destraban to Dunblane.\nThe provisions in the will for laying out one of his plantations at the end of twenty-five years into a city to be called Dunblane, and establishing a manufactory in it, are, in my opinion, an attempt to perpetuate his succession and violate the policy of the law. It must be observed, that the future city was not to pass from his succession, but to remain forever a part of it. If lie had bequeathed the Destrchan plantation to a contemplated charitable corporation, not in esse, but thereafter to be incorporated, then the disposition would have been like that in Mylne\u2019s case. But here the future city was to remain in his succession. What he says of an incorporation seems to me to be in quite another sense. It was, that an act of incorporation for the purposes of municipal government should be obtained. A number of villagers ask the Legislature to incorporate them as a cily, and the Legislature does so. What is the effect of such an incorporation? A mere provision for the purposes of municipal government. The lands and the houses remain the property of the respective villagers. So here, the succession of Henderson would still remain the owner of the Destrehan lands after the city of Dunblane was established upon them and incorporated. The rents of the tenements, the products of the contemplated manufactory, the fruits of the soil, would have still belonged to his succession, and been collected and gathered by his executors. There is not a word in the will that takes the ownership of the proposed city out of his succession. But that, if carried into effect it takes it out of commerce forever, is indisputable. He expressly orders, \u201cit is to remain forever as a part of my succession.\u201d The executors might lease, but could not sell. In this particular the provision is not peculiar. His intention was the same as to his real estate in the city. It was to remain upon ground rent, and \u201cno lease to exceed twenty-five years intime.\u201d The conclusion, indeed, from the entire will, is irresistible, that the testator deshed to perpetuate a large portion of his succession, and that this was the dominant idea under which it was composed.\nIt is said that the provisions of the will do not amount in law to a substitution or a jidei commissum, and consequently are not reprobated by law. Conceding that they do not fall technically under either of these denominations, still they are clearly opposed to the policy of our laws and jurisprudence, which resists the perpetuation of estates. Their spirit is to prevent property from being tied up for a length of time in the hands of individuals, and placed out of the reach of commerce. If it would be illegal for a testator \u201cto leave his property to any person or set of persons with the charge to preserve it, and to transfer it at their death to some persons designated,\u201d as conceded by the learned counsel in his brief a fortiori, is it unlawful to tie it up in the hands of the executors and commissioners forever.\nAs to the provision in the fifteenth article for the erection of a chapel, and a house for the minister, his salary, &c., it is clear that this provision is most intimately connected with the scheme of establishing on the Destrehan plantation the town of Dunblane, and populating it with workmen from Scotland, as directed in an antecedent part of the will. It is so interwoven with that portion of the will as to be dependant upon it and legally indivisible. The nullity therefore, of the one carries with it the nullity of the other. It is impossible to deduce from the will itself the conviction that the article in question would have been adopted, if the testator had known that his desire with regard to the town and manufactory could not be accomplished. On the contrary, the opposite conclusion is unavoidable.\nThe sixth and seventh clauses of the will contain provisions respecting the sending of his slaves to Africa, the disposition to be made of such as do not wish to go, \u00e1te.; and the eighth article is as follows : \u201cSome arrangements must be made with Henry JDoyal, who is one half owner of the Mount Houmas plantation and slaves, by selling the land to him at the end of the first five years; he, in the meantime, must liquidate his account at his leisure, paying no more interest upon any balance that may be due to my estate than six per cent per annum; the negroes upon the Houmas estate to be emancipated upon the same conditions as those upon the other plantations, one-half of them being already my property. Mr. JDoyal would no doubt make an agreement with the executors for those belonging to him; every thing, however, must be settled with Mr Doyal within ten years after my death; be has been a faithful agent and partner in the management of these estates. I therefore recommend him to the indulgence and notice of the executors.\u201d\nThe court, not being at present prepared to express an opinion upon the testamentary provisions as regards the slaves generally, has, under the written agreement of the parties, retained that portion of the cause for further consideration. But whatever may be our conclusion upon the general question, there is abraneh of it as to which our opinion is formed, and which it is proper to act upon now, as it appears from the statements of counsel, the distribution of a large amount <of funds is dependent upon it.\nMr. Doyal has protested against this disposition of the will; has notified the executors of his refusal; and has appeared in this suit by counsel, for the purpose of resisting this interference with his property.\nWe are of opinion, that even if we should come to the conclusion hereafter, , \u201e . . . ,, , . , , . - that the provisions concerning the slaves generally on the various plantations lett by the testator,are valid and can be carried into effect, DoyaVs share of the slaves cannot be affected by the dispositions of the will without his consent; and that so far the dispositions of the will must fail. Hence, if the disposition as to the testator\u2019s interest in the Houmas slaves be hereafter declared valid and practicable, all the executors can do, will be to provoke a proceeding in the nature of a partition in kind of the slaves, and carry out the benevolent dispositions of the testator in behalf of those that may fall upon such proceeding, to the succession of Henderson.\nAs, however, the members of the court are not unanimous upon this point, it is proper that the reasons which have induced the majority to come to this conclusion should be stated at length; and in doing so, it is necessary to notice in detail what was said by the testator, and what has been done by the residuary legatees, by the executors, and by Doyal.\nThe eighth clause of the will is considered by Judge Preston as indivisible; in other words, as authorizing a sale of the undivided half of the plantation to Doyal, only in case he should consent to sell his own half of the slaves. In this opinion we do not concur. Mr. Doyal was the owner of an undivided half of the land and slaves. He had been a faithful agent and partner; the testator appreciated his fidelity and the propriety of rewarding, it by indulging him in the payment of what he owed, and giving him an opportunity of buying the outstanding half of the land at private sale. He did not desire to expose a faithful agent and partner to the inconvenience of cutting up the land by a partition in kind, or the competition of a public sale of the whole by a decree of partition which might result in bringing in a stranger as co-proprietor with Doyal. But Doyal, being an owner, was not bound to sell his undivided half of the slaves. He might not desire to part with them, from feelings of attachment, or conside rations of interest. And to suppose that the testator desired to coerce him into such a sale of his slaves by withholding a sale to him of the land except upon those terms, is inconsistent with the indulgent and grateful disposition towards him which the will exhibits.\nWe, therefore, conclude that the testator desired that a sale of the land on easy terms should be made to Doyal. That he desired also, that his executors should buy Doyal\u2019s half of the slaves, so that the whole might be emancipated. But that he did not intend to withhold the sale of the land if Doyal refused, and was aware that in that event his testamentary disposition would operate only on the undivided half of the slaves attached to the Houmas estate.\nLet us now examine the power of attorney given by the residuary legatees to Most and Montgomery; premising that the testator himself intimates in his second will his doubts as to the validity of portions of his first will, by directing that any property not passing for any cause whatever under the first will should accrue to the legatees under that will; and premising also, that the residuary legatees have, throughout, contested the validity of that portion of the first will which proposes the emancipation of the slaves.\nIn the act of 7th April, 1839, these residuary legatees, who, in tho absence of a will, would have been heirs of the deceased, having extinguished, by compromises, the claims of other legatees, and thus become the owners of the entire property of the succession, subject, however, to such valid charges as the testator may have imposed upon it, made transfers, partly to each other, of various portions of the testator\u2019s property, and among others of three plantations and the slaves attached thereto. But in order to secure to the slaves their ullimate rights, such as they might be, judicially ascertained under the wills, the transferrees of the respective plantations and slaves covenanted, that should the courts having jurisdiction in the matter decide that the slaves belonging to the respective plantations are entitled to be sent to Africa and receive one hundred dollars each, then they would comply with the directions of the will, and support the charges of its execution in that particular; and, on the other hand, would receive a deduction from the price of twenty per cent on the appraised value of the slaves. They also constituted' P. A. Most and Jonathan Montgomery their attornies, with authority to administer all the property of the succession undisposed of, to collect debts, settle accounts, pay creditors, and close the estate. They also authorized them to sell to Doyal the undivided half of the Mount Houmas plantation and slaves \u201cfor and in consideration of the sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, payable in five equal installments from the day such sale shall have been made, and under the following conditions, to wit: That in case the Court of Probates for the parish and city of New Orleans, or the court having jurisdiction in the matter, should decide that the undivided half of the slaves belonging to the succession of the late Stephen Henderson, are to be sent to Africa, in obedience to the last will of the said late Stephen Henderson, and are entitled to receive each one hundred dollars, and in the event that the said Henry Doyal should, in such case, agree to receive a sum of money to consent that his own half of the said slaves shall also be sent to Africa on the same conditions, then the said Henry Doyal shall bind himself to comply with such part of the judgment of said court on the subject; and that in such case a deduction of twenty per cent on the appraised value of the slaves, as the same are appraised in the inventory, shall be made from the first installment of the purchase price of the said plantation and slaves. That in the event the said Henry Doyal shall refuse to purchase the undivided half of said plantation and slaves on the conditions herein specified, an action of partition shall be instituted against the said Henry Doyal, and the Mount Houmas plantation will be sold at public auction in order to effect said partition.\u201d\nWhat is the meaning of this power, which is certainly inartificially expressed, and is not free from obscurity ? Does it mean that the attornies shall not sell to Doyal except upon the double condition that he will let Henderson\u2019s half of the slaves go to Africa if the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction should sustain the validity of the testator\u2019s will respecting those slaves, and will also agree to receive a sum of money to consent that his own half shall be sent to Africa ? Or does it mean that the attornies, if unable to obtain such consent, may still sell to Doyal upon conditions that he will bind himself to comply with the judgment as to the half of the slaves; leaving his consent or refusal as to his own half open for future negotiation? The question is not free from difficulty, looking merely at the instrument itself. But it loses its importance when we consider the manner in which this obscure power was presently thereafter executed by the agents, Rost and Montgomery, and the subsequent acquiescence of their principles. A few weeks after the execution of this power of attorney, we find Doyal and the agents meeting before a notary, to pass the act of sale under which he now holds Henderson\u2019s undivided half of the Houmas plantation and slaves. The act commences by recitals. It refers to the eighth clause of the will, the recommendation of the testator that the half of the land should be sold to Doyal; the indulgence proposed by the testator to be extended to him in liquidating his account, the testator\u2019s desire that all the Houmas slaves should be emancipated, one-half of them being already his property, and that an agreement to that end should be made with Doyal by the executors. It declares, that by virtue of the will, he, Doyal, claims the right of purchasing the undivided half of the Houmas plantation and slaves belonging to the succession at a reasonable price, to be fixed by experts in case the parties could not agree upon the same. Doyal then declares, that \u201cwhereas the said late Stephen Henderson did, by the said last will, direct his testamentary executors to make some arrangement with him, the said Henry Doyal, and to pay him a certain sum of money to consent and permit that all the slaves attached to the said Mount Houmas plantation may be emancipated and sent to Africa, in the manner and at the time provided by the last will of the said late Stephen Henderson,, and that the said slaves receive each one hundred dollars. Now he, the said Henry Doyal, here declares, that he does hereby expressly refuse his assent to the execution of this or any part of the last will of the said late Stephen Henderson, relative to the emancipation of the said slaves attached to the Mount Houmas plantation, and as owner of the undivided half of all the said slaves, he objects to their emancipation, and formally denies the right of the said late Stephen Henderson, to emancipate any of the said slaves without his consent.\u201d\nDoyal then proceeds to declare, that he has taken cognizance of a deed of compromise made between the residuary legatees John Henderson and others, with certain other legatees of the deceased, and the extinguishment of the interest Of the latter; also of a compromise between the residuary legatees their agreement for the disposal of the remaining property, stocks and credits of the succession, and the powers granted to Henderson and Rost; their agreement to sell the undivided half of the Houmas plantation and slaves to him, and the grant of power to Rost and Henderson to sell to him ; and he declares that he consents to accept the sale proposed to be made to him as aforesaid. \u201cWherefore,\u201d says the act, \u201c by reason of the foregoing, and in conformity with and by virtue of the powers granted to the said parties of the first part (Rost and Montgomery,) the said Rost and Montgomery sell to Royal the undivided half of the plantation and slaves.\u201d After fully describing the land and slaves, reciting the titles under which Henderson and Royal respectively held by undivided moieties, stating the price, $125,000, the promise of Royal to pay it in conformity with the terms and conditions fixed by the said legatees in the aforesaid compromise, and in the powers conferred unto their said attornies, describing the notes given by Royal, &e., the act concludes with the following clause: \u201cIt is further agreed and understood by and between the said parties hereto, that the present sale is made and accepted under the condition that in case the Court of Probates for the parish and city of New Orleans, or any court having competent jurisdiction in the matter, shall decide that the undivided half of the slaves attached to the said plantation and belonging to the estate of the said late Stephen Henderson, are to be sent to Africa in obedience to the last will of the said late Stephen Henderson, and are entitled to receive each one hundred dollars, the said Henry Royal shall, as he does hereby bind himself, comply with such part of the judgment of said court on the subject, and that in such case a deduction of twenty per cent on the appraised value of the said slaves as the same are appraised in the inventory of the said plantation and slaves made by the Hon. Edward Ruffel, parish judge, in and for the parish of Ascension, on the 6th day of April, 1838, shall be made from the first installment of the purchase price of the said plantation and slaves, or from any other installment of the said purchase price as the said parties may agree upon.\u201d\nThe legal effect of this act I conceive to be, that Royal binds himself to carry into effect a judgment, if such be rendered, recognizing the validity of the testator\u2019s disposition for the liberation of his half of the slaves; but does not bind himself, and, on the contrary, expressly refuses, to sell his own half so as to enable the parties to carry out Henderson\u2019s desire to emancipate the whole. Royal\u2019s half was not affected before the act of purchase, by the testamentary disposition of his co-proprietor. He considered himself as having an equitable claim under the will to demand a sale of the undivided half of the land, even if he refused to sell his half of the slaves. Standing on his rights as owner, he refuses that consent, but agrees to execute the testator\u2019s wishes respecting the testator\u2019s own half, which alone the testator could control, if a court of competent jurisdiction should adjudge the validity of Henderson\u2019s will respecting the liberation of his share of the slaves. To this view of the matter the agents must be considered as assenting. Else, why did they not insert in the act an express covenant on Royal\u2019s part to sell his undivided half? and why also did they not agree upon the price to be paid to Royal ? Flow is it that the act speaks as to Henderson\u2019s undivided half and is silent as to the other ? It cannot be said that the meaning in the power is that Royal is to be allowed twenty per cent on the appraised value of the slaves \u2014 the whole slaves. I understand the power as adopting that standard as to the undivided half proposed to be sold to Royal, and contemplating a sum of money to be fixed by future agreement for the purchase of Royal\u2019s undivided half.\nThe true test of the legal effect of the act of sale to Royal is, to enquire whether upon that act the residuary legatees, or the executors, or any one else could, by suit, compel Royal to give up the whole of the slaves upon receiving either the twenty per cent of the appraised value in the inventories, or an estimated value of one-half of the slaves with a deduction of twenty per cent upon the purchase price of the other half. After the most careful investigation which I have been able to give to his contract, I am unable to say that I could consent to a judgment taking the whole of the slaves from him without his consent.\nIn the construction of all instruments, it is the duty of the court to collect the intention from the whole instrument taken together; and I concede that even matter put by way of recital in an instrument may sometimes amount to an agreement. But I am unable to perceive how in this case the reference to the power of attorney, itself of difficult interpretation, can create by implication a promise to do an act which the party in express terms refuses to do.\nIt is said that a partition cannot be had, if the validity of the testamentary disposition touching the undivided half of Henderson should be her'eafter adjudged, because the estate of Henderson has ceased, by the sale to JDoyal, to be a co-proprietor. It has ceased to be co-proprietor, but only sub modo. If such validity should be adjudged, the moiety upon which the will of the deceased will operate can be ascertained by a proceeding in the nature of a judicial partition. Doyal is bound by his covenant to submit to such a division.\nIn conclusion, I have to observe that not only does the execution of the power show how it was understood by the agents, and the acquiescence in that execution how it was understood by the principals; but the pleadings of the executors point to the interpretation which I have given, and the argument of their counsel admits its correctness.\nIn the answer of the executors in this cause they say, as one of the reasons why they should not give up the assets in their hands to the residuary legatees, \u201c that a sum equal to the amount to be paid under the will to Henry Doyal, if he should be compelled to sell his undivided half of the slaves attached -to the Mount Houmas plantation, must also remain with the executors, the eventual claim of Doyal being one of the charges, and indeed a debt of the succession.\u201d \u201c That the said Henry Doyal has served upon the executors a protest by notarial act, against that portion of the will which directs his undivided half of the slaves upon the Mount Houmas plantation to be purchased from him, so that they may be sent to Africa, and that it is necessary he should have notice of these proceedings.\u201d\nAnd in the brief filed in behalf of the -executors in this court, the counsel of the executors say: \u201c But with regard to the slaves owned jointly by the deceased and Henry Doyal, we apprehend their fate can hardly be finally decided in this case as it presents itself under the agreement. When in the .8th article of the will the testator prescribes the arrangements to be made with Doyal, it is little else than a desire he expresses, the realization of -svhich he endeavors to render easy by the advantages he confers, and the friendly disposition he exhibits towards his partner. This clause, however, taken abstractly, would seem not to be executable, as there is no law that can compel a man in such a case to cede his property. The consent of Mr. Doyal might have easily settled the difficulty. But as he has peremptorily l\u2019efused it, we should think that the benefit which the testator intended to .confer on all the slaves of the Houmas plantation, can, at best, attach only one-half of them. A partition in nature of the slaves, held in common .by the testator and Henry Doyal, might be effected, and would become, the means of attaining, in part at least, the end proposed by the will. The slaves falling to the lot of the testator might be enfranchised in the same manner as those which he owned exclusively.\u201d\nIt is therefore decreed, that the ninth, tenth, thirteenth, fifteenth and seventeenth .clauses of said will, as set forth in the schedule annexed to this decree as part thereof, are, and they are hereby declared null and void. And it is further decreed, that the provision in the said will contained, touching the liberation of the slaves attached to the Houmas plantation, if they should hereafter be decreed valid, can only operate upon su.ch portions of said slaves as may on a proceeding in the nature of a judicial partition in kind fall to the succession of said Stephen Henderson the testator, and not upon the portion of said Hoyal. And it is further decreed, that this decree shall become final within the usual delay without reference to such portions of the cause as, under the agreement of the parties on file in this cause, are reserved for further consideration and decree.\nAnd it is now ordered, that the questions in this cause touching the liberation of the slaves of said succession, except so far as in the foregoing decree they are determined, be reserved for further consideration by this court.\nSchedule, \u201cArt. 9. The Destrehan estate is to remain forever as a part of my succession, and at the end of twenty-five years from my death it must be laid out into a city, to be named Destrehan.\u201d\n\u201c Art. 10. Four acres including the back and front garden, running back with parallel lines to the lakes, with all the dwellings, to remain as one lot, with a good street and buildings upon each sid.e of said street.\u201d\n\u201cArt. 13. When thp funds can be spared after twenty years, I wish a large manufactory of negro shoes and coarse clothes to be erected at Destrehan, under the direction of experienced workmen from Scotland. Destrehan city must be incorporated by an act of the Legislature. If these manufactories are well conducted, it will be the means of doing much good to the country, and give employment to a great many of the poor, and it will no doubt be the means of stimulating a great many of the young men to exert themselves, because by perseverance and industry they see what can be done.\u201d\n\u201cArt. 15. I wish a chapel or church to be erected upon the upper corner of the four acres lot, and a Presbyterian minister to be sent for from Dunblane or its neighborhood, at a moderate salary; I also wish a good house for the minister to be erected upon the lower corner of the four acres lot; there must also be a small house for the education of the poor of the town, over which the minister must preside.\u201d\n\u201c Art. 17. Upon mature reflection, I have concluded to name the Destrehan plantation, when it is incorporated as a city, Dunblane, inplg.ee of Destrehan as named in the foregoing.\u201d\n*\nThisis my last olographic will and testament,, made and done at the city of JSTew Orleans, this 1st day of August, 1837, in the presence of the almighty and eternal God, I humbly and solemnly approach the throne of grace, hoping that through our Lord Jesus Christ forgiveness of all my sins, Amen.\nArt. 1st. I nominate and appoint Stephen Henderson, Jr., Jonathan Montgomery, and P. A. Rost, Esqrs , to be my testamentary executors.\n2d. In their absence\/frora the United Slates*, resignation or death, that their places is to be filled by one or two commissioners as the case may be,. and requires the commissioners to be appointed by the governor of the State, and any one of the judges of the Supreme Court, and the judge of the First Judicial District Court, or any two of them to malte the appointment of the commissioners, who will be entitled to a yearly salai'y of fifteen hundred dollars each. There is no commissioners, however, to be appointed until the death or resignation of two of the testamentary executors, who will be entitled to the same salary, say fifteen hundred dollars per annum, and when it becomes necessary to appoint one or more commissioners, the first must always be a Scotchman, aud lastly when the whole three has to be appointed by the officers of the State', one of which number must always be from my native country. They must be moral, correct, honest and intelligent men, and under a good character. Any two of the judges can dismiss them for any great or strong presumptive crime. They must keep an office and employ a clerk at a salrry of fifteen hundred dollars per annum. He must keep a set of books and accounts, which must be examined and approved annually by any two of the judges.\nArt. 3 My estate is not to go into court except for the purpose of probating and of opening of the wills, havingno forced heirs, but every thing belongingto my estate is to be continued and conducted as it may be found at my death. The executors or commissioners to keep upon each plantation a good planter and a man of humanity. He must not, under no circumstances, treat the blacks with cruelty, but on the contrary with kindness; and they must allow for every grown person that labors, three pounds of good beef or pork per week, and in that proportion for all the young ones. There must be strict discipline and good order kept amongst all the negroes, and in all their quarters. I have always considered this allowance, with what they made upon their own patch of ground, which must be allowed to all those that labor, as an abundance; more particularly so if they get as much good fresh cornmeal as they stand in need of This treatment, in my humble opinion, places the black in a much more and happier situation than many of the lower order who has to labor in Europe, or\u2018even in the Eastern States. I have always treated my blacks with much indulgence, and even personal kindness.\nArt. 4. I have always been opposed to slavery, but as it is a property recognized by the Constitution of ihe United States,.to take that away, you would at once destroy the greatest and best regulated government nowin the Oidor New World. Therefore, all attempts made by tbe fanatics or misguided people thatls going about and preaching, like evil spirits, against slavery, turns the heads of the unfortunate negroes, and prepares them for the commission of every kind of crime, which compels their masters to limit the very liberty which they formerly awarded to them. In a great moral point of view a good master ought to be as care* fill of his slaves as be is of bis own family. All those who forget this duty has much to account for; but I am decidedly opposed to tbe people of any other State or country, interfering in any manner with our domestic concerns.\nArt. 5. There must be written rules for -tbe government of all my slaves upon all of my different estates. They are not to be taken oat to work until nearly sunrise in the morning, nor are they to be kept in the field longer than half an hour after sundown in the evening. Sunday is to be a day of rest upon all my plantations, except the people who may choose to work upon their own piece of ground, or to be paid for their labor by their overseer, but under no circumstance are \u00abthey-tp be permitted to leave their respective camps without permission from their overseei*. It is clearly understood, however, that during tbe time that they are engaged in taking off the sugar and cotton crops, they are to work as they formerly did; because, by their care and labor every thing is to be made, and by that the comfort of themselves and others are to be secured.\nArt. 6. All the children that is born five years after my death, if females, are to be free at the age of twenty years, and male children at the age of twenty-five; and at the end of the five years as aforesaid there may be.drawn by lot, out of all the slaves ten, five females and five males who will be furnished with a free passage to our settlement in Africa, and one hundred dollars each ; but they must go of their own free will, and to return to slavery, if ever they return back to this country. At the end of ten years twenty may be emancipated in the same manner as the first five; and in twenty-five years all the first born free may be sent off with the entire remainder of the old stock that is willing to go, so as that at the end of twenty-five years from my death, there will not he upon any of my estates any other slaves but the apprentice children. And if the other slaves did not wish to go to Africa, they will remain upon their respective plantations upon which they reside as apprentices, and to be provided for accordingly, but to be strictly under the management of the overseer, as well as all their offspring, the whole tobe considered as apprentices, and their labor to be applied to the general good of all the affairs of my succession.\nArt. 7. It must be clearly understood, that the benefit now granted to my slaves it not to extend.to a murderer or thief, or a confirmed runaway, or for any other high crime that can be legally proved before the executors or the commissioners, which they have been guilty of; but at the same time I wish the negroes to have a fair, just and impartial trial, the same in point of fact, as if they were tried before a judicial tribunal.\nArt. 8. Some arrangement must be made with Henry Doyal, who is one-half owner of the Mount Jioamas plantation and slaves, by selling the land to him at the end of the first five years, he in the meantime must liquidate his account at his leisure, paying no more interest upon any balance that may be due to my estate than six per cent per annum. The negroes upon the Houmas estate to be emancipated upon the same conditions as those upon the other plantations, onerhalf of them being already my property, Mr. Doyal would, no doubt, make an agreement with the executors for those belonging to him. Everything, however, must be settled with Mr. Doyal within ten years after my death. He has been a faithful agent and partner in the management of these estates, I therefore recommend him to the indulgence and notice of the executors.\nArt 9. The Destrehan estate is to remain forever as apart of my succession; and at the end of twenty-five years from my death, it must be laid out into a city to be named Dcstrelian.\nArt. 10. Four acres, including the back and front garden, running back with parallel lines to the lakes, with all the dwellings to remain as one lot, with a good street, and buildings upon each side o\u00ed said street.\nArt. 11. All my real estate in the city to remain upon ground rent, and no lease to exceed twenty-five years in time, all the stocks to be sold in ten years from my death.\nArt. 12. I'leave the following legacies, having no forced heirs, to my brother John Henderson, or to his heirs, if dead, two thousand dollars per annum, and to be paid upon due proof, and to the proper person authorized to receive the sam.e, say $2000. Ditto two thousand dollars to my sister Ann Henderson, or to her heirs, and to be paid upon the same terms and conditions, say $2000. Two thousand dollars to my nephew, Stephen Henderson, Jr., or to his heirs, if dead, and upon the same terms as to the family of John Henderson, say $2000. Two thousand to the children of my late nephew Geo. Henderson or to their heirs, and on the same conditions, say $2000. Two thousand dollars to be paid annually to the poor of the parish of Orleans, to be distributed by persons appointed for that purpose by the governor, one of the judges of the Supreme Court, and the judge of the Court of Probates for the parish of Orleans, $2000. Two thousand dollars per annum to be paid to the poor of the town of Dunblane, in Pertshire, North Britain; this sum to be divided by the resident minister of the Presbyterian church, and to the two highest civil officers in the town to be paid upon due proof of their acceptance of the trust, say $2000. Two thousand dollars for the erection of a school house in the town of Dunblane, for ten years only, and for the purpose of educating of the poor, this being the place of my birth. I feel no obligation, however, for these acts of charity. It is only done to help the poor, who like myself may he thrown upon the world without a penny or a friend. My greatest object is to do the greatest quantity of good, and to the greatest number of persons and to the poorest people. I shall leave the world without regret, believing that I shall go to a better and happier one, and God grant that all man kind maybe pi*epaved fortius last, eternal and awful change; as it is the immutable laws of Heaven that we must all die, let us be ready and prepared as nearly as we can.\nArt. 13. When funds can be spared after twenty years, I wish a large manufactory of negroe shoes and coarse clothes to be ejected at Destrehan, under the direction of experienced workmen from Scotland. Destrehan city mast be incorporated by an act of the Legislative. If these manufactories arc well conducted, it will be the means of doing much good to the country, and give employment to a great many of the poor, a?id it will, no doubt, be the means of stimulating a great many of the young men to exert themselves, because by perseverance and industry they see what can be done. My whole family may be considered as a family of drunkards, and this misfortune must have come upon the side of my father, although thathewas an antiquarian, learned and intelligent, yet to get drunk once a month was to him a jubilee. My mother was a Drummond, a descendant of the Me\u2019Gregors, good natured, but without much capacity; they were honorable and high-minded as respects their intercourse with others, but profligate and indolent as respects the management of tlicir private concerns; being poor they were always in bankruptcy.\nArt. 14. After the first five years, the executors will divide the following sums amongst the four following congregations, say, Clapp\u2019s Church two thousand dollars; Catholic Cathedral two thousand dollars; the English Church in Canal street two thousand dollars, and the church commenced by Maffit two thousand dollars; and the Orphan Boys two thousand dollars, and to the Orphan Female Society two thousand dollars ; the legacies to the four churches is only to remain and be payable for five years ; but all the others so far named are to be perpetual. Two thousand dollars per annum to the Charity Hospital; five hundred dollars per annum to the Firemen\u2019s funds : this last class of people are much exposed, and ought to be protected. My house furniture and plate to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the erection of a tomb to be erected over my grave, and my burying place must be the Church of St. Charles, and to be interred alongside of my late beautiful and accomplished wife ZeliaD. Henderson, the whole tobe surrounded by a neat iron railing, and the tomb as well as the railing to be keptin good order by the executors. Mrs. R. A. Rost will receive all my diamonds and jewels, that belonged to her late sister, giving a part to Mrs. Marigny of such of them as she thinks fit.\nArt. 15. I wish a chapel or church to he erected upon the upper corner of the four acres lot, and a Presbyterian minister to be sent for from Dunblane or its neighborhood, at a moderate salary. I also wish a good house for the minister to be erected upon the lower corner of the four acres lot. There must also be a small house for the education of the poor of the town, over which the minister must preside.\nArt. 16. All my debts, if any, must be settled and liquidated before any of the legacies is paid. There must be no exception taken to this will, either on account of form, writing or spelling.\nArt. 17. Upon mature reflection I have concluded to name the Destrehan plantation when it is incorporated as a city, Dunblane in place of Destrehan as named in the foregoing. As life is uncertain, I will sign this will as it.is written, in haste, and add a codicil to it hereafter, if it is necessary hereafter.\nNew Orleans, 1st of August, 1837. (Signed,) S. Henderson.\nNevanetur, New Orleans, 14th March, 1838. (Signed,) J. Bermudez, Judge.\nBe it remembered, that on the fifth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight, Stephen I-Ienderson of the city of New Orleans, being in his house in Canal street, sick of body, but sound of mind, presented to the undersigned witnesses, all residing in the city of New Orleans, this paper which he had caused to be written out of their presence, and declared to them that it contained his last will.\nOn the first of August eighteen hundred and thirty seven, I made an olographic will disposing of all my property for the following objects. 1st. The payment of all my just debts.\n2d. The payment of certain legacies therein specified.\n3d. The erection and gradual improvement of a new city.\nI intended to have made various changes and additions to said will, which circumstances (have prevented me from doing, and the present will is made to remedy any error of law or fact, or any other deficiency to be found therein.\nI do hereby confirm said will in all its clauses, and it is my wish and request that all my debts be punctually paid, and that all the dispositions contained in said will in relation to the erection and gradual improvement of the new city ordered to be erected by said will he carried in full effect, agreeably to the true intent and meaning thereof.\nI hereby make anew each of the particular legacies contained in my said will, in favor of each of the legatees purely and simply, and it is my wish and desire that any property of which I may die possessed, not passing for any cause whatever under any of the dispositions of any former will, or of this, may accrue to them in proportion to the amount of their respective legacies,-or their value.\nIn remuneration of their faithful services I give their freedom to my house servants Lucy and Agnes. They will be emancipated next fall, and in the meantime remain in my house in Canal street.\nThe jewels of which I may die possessed, will he divided between my nieces Louisa Foucher and Adilla Marigny, and the oldest daughter of my nephew George Henderson, deceased, in the following manner, Louisa Foucher will receive the breast-pin with my portrait set in diamonds; Adilla Marigny will take the medallion of diamonds, and the daughter of George Henderson shall receive the balance of the jewels, whatever they may be; she will further receive all the woman\u2019s apparel made or not made, found in my possession, and the miniature portrait of my late wife, Mrs. Henderson. I give all the family pictures which I have to Mrs. Rost and her sister Mrs. Grilhe.\nI give and bequeath to Henry Doyal of Mount Houmas, the carpets, looking glasses, side board, curtains and pier tables of my drawing room, and of my dining room, also two bedsteads, one armoir, and ono-balf of the bedding and table cloth in my New Orleans house, to be used by him to furnish the new house which he is about to build on the Mount Houmas plantation-, and not otherwise. The rest of my household and kitchen furniture will be sent to my three other plantations ; one press and a part of the bedding and table eloth will be sent to each of the cotton plantations.\nIt is my will and desire; and I do hereby revoke the appointment which I had made in my former will, of my nephew Stephen Henderson as one of my trustees, my reasons for doing so are that liis duties are such, would take too much of his time, but ho shall receive all the legacies made to him; and I further bequeath him the sum of five hundred dollars payable immediately, and\u2019also payable annually the amount to which he would have been entitled for commissions as trustee had he acted, on condition that ho shall pay over to the heirs of George Henderson one-halfof the amountof such annual payment. I also give andbequeath to him my gold watch, my wslking cane, and all my wearing apparel, without exception, linnen, cloth, &c.; and I give and bequeath to Peter A. Rost my carnation breast-pin, being the one I wear, together with my guns. I give and bequeath my diamond breast-pin to Jonathan Montgomery, and I further give and bequeath all my stock of wine to the said Peter A\u2022 Rost and Jonathan Montgomery jointly.\nIt is my wish and desire, that next fall a competent person be employed who will give all his time and attention to the affairs of my estate, and the management of my plantations ; and that a suitable compensation be allowed him. Philip Rockford will be employed until that time, and should his services as clerk be no longer necessary, he shallreceive out of my estate the sum of one hundred dollars, besides his salary. If deemed necessary to carry my two wills into effect, and not otherwise, I appoint Jonathan Montgomery and Peter A. Rost my testamentary executors and give them the seizin of my estate.\nThe foregoing last will was then read by Theodore Clapp, one-of the witnesses, to the other witnesses, in presence of the testator who approved the same in all its parts, but did not sign it, being unable to do so, as he stated, on account of weakness; and the\u2019 same was then signed by all the witnesses, without passing to other acts, the day, month and year above written.\n(Signed.)

Yates, vs. Henry Yates and others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4895226\/","date":"1850-09-02","court":"New York Supreme Court","content":"By the Court, Wright, J.\nThe intent.of the testator, manifested by his will, was, after the payment of debts and legacies, to appropriate the remainder of Ms large estate, real and personal, to the endowment and support of a school embracing literary instruction, combined with the pursuits of real life of every practical descriptionthe institution to be called the Polytechny, and to be formed upon the plan, as near as might be, laid down in a memorial presented by him to the legislature of the state of New-York, and the report of a committee and draft of a law founded thereon, during the session of the year 1830. The object, therefore, for which the testator attempted to create a trust of the residuum of his estate was laudable, though the scheme for effectuating it should be regarded as impracticable, and inconsistent with the rules of law. The intent was charitable, and the public were eventually to be the beneficiaries of the use. The end in view was to aid in raising the standard of popular information, and thus, as the testator himself expresses it, \u201c to give greater stability to the political institutions of the country.\u201d\nBut though the object, in itself considered, may be meritorious, it must fail if the testator has attempted to carry it out in hostility to established legal rules. The duty of the court is to expound and declare the law, not to make it. The predilections of the judge form no excuse for encroachment upon the province of the legislature. If the testator has aimed at the creation of a trust not authorized by law, or if during the continuance of such trust, the power of alienation is suspended, and the trust term is not legally limited, the trust is invalid, the intent of the testator has failed, and so much of his estate as was the subject of the void trust is vested in his heirs at law and next of kin. So, also, if the trust created may be lawfully performed under a power, and the absolute power of alienation is not limited according to law, the power in trust is void, as powers in trust are subject to the same rules, as to the suspension of the power of alienation, as direct trusts. (Hawley v. James, 16 Wend. 185,178.) And let me remark, that although 'a laudable charity may be defeated by applying the provisions of law prohibiting perpetuities, the wisdom of those provisions is not to be summarily impugned. In England, for a long period, the common law courts struggled, aided occasionally by the legislature, against a disposition of the aristocracy to tie up and fetter inheritances indefinitely, to withdraw them from the world of commerce, and prevent their free and untrammelled transmission from man to man. If to render the property and accumulated wealth of England inalienable for an unreasonable length of time, was an evil demanding the efforts of her enlightened judiciary to relieve, how greatly in this country must the evil arising from like causes be magnified. In England, perpetuities were one device for building up and sustaining aristocratical pretension ; here, tending as they must, to tie up and withdraw from circulation the capital of the country, they would be at war with the principles and spirit of our institutions. It is also to be borne in mind, that alienations to pious and charitable uses have been most fruitful devices for locking up property, insomuch that in England, at one period, according to Lord Hardwicke, the clergy and religious houses had contrived to possess themselves of nearly half of the whole real property of the kingdom. (1 Vesey, 223.) \u201cThe term mortmain, (says Lewis, speaking of the British mortmain act, 9 Geo. 2, chap. 36,) as its derivation signifies, is not necessarily confined to the landed possessions of corporations ; it equally applies to all property, that, from the nature of the purposes to which it is devoted, or the character of the ownership to which it is subjected, is for every practical purpose in a dead or unserviceable hand. This, it is obvious, is the characteristic of alienations to charitable uses; it is the very nature of such dispositions to withdraw the subject\" of them from every kind of circulation, since a contrary course defeats- their manifest object.\u201d (Lewis on Perpetuities, 689.) Public policy, therefore, demands that the alienation of property for any purpose shall not be unreasonably suspended. The legislature, with the experience of all Christian nations before them, and with a knowledge of the mischiefs resulting from such suspension; have defined its limits. It is our duty to apply the law, though the charity may fail. It were better indeed that it should fail, than that this court should falter in giving full effect to a wise and salutary restriction.\nThe term charity does not extend to particular gifts to particular persons. A fund\" supplied from private gift for any legal, public or general purpose, is a charity. (2 Sim. & Stu\u00e1rt, 67, 594.) The\u2019establishment of a school for learning of any description, and donations' for the establishment of colleges and schools, are charities: (2 Howard, 19.) As I have already intimated, the trust created by the will of the testator, of the- residuum of his estate, is for a charitable use. It is intended as a public charity. The question therefore is, can it be exectited ?\nThe counsel for\u2019the' trustees concede that this charity would not be good in England, on account of the mortmain act. (9 Geo. 2, chap. 36.) That act avoids \u00bf11 devises to charitable uses. But were it not for that act, they insist, it would be good, and- that the court of chancery, by virtue of an original inherent jurisdiction, independent of the statute of 43d Elizabeth, commonly called the statute of charitable\" uses, would e\u00f1forc\u00e9'its execution ; that the English law of' charities,- including that which authorizes a court of-equity to carry them into effect, was not derived from or founded on the statute of 43d Elizabeth, but was a part of the common law of England before and since that st\u00e1tute was enacted ; and being so, it became a part of the law of this state by constitutional adoption. The conclusion deduced is, that (conceding the statute of Elizabeth never\" to have been in force in this state, or to have been\" repealed,) the legislature' having repealed the statutes of mortmain, and the provisions of the revised statutes as to uses and trusts having no reference to or effect upon charitable uses and trusts, \u2022 if this charity would' be upheld in England, by virtue of the common law, independent of any statute, it should be upheld here.\nDevises, bequests, and conveyances for charitable purposes were, it would seem, in some cases, enforced at law as a condition, prior to the statute of Elizabeth. (Porter\u2019s case, 1 Rep. 22.) The obligation was lawful, and on a failure to perform, the estate was forfeited. But whether the English court of chancery exercised jurisdiction over charities as such, in any shape, prior to the statute of Elizabeth, has, at least until a very recent period, been doubted. It has not been easy to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to how far the present authority and doctrines of the court of chancery in regard to charitable uses, depend upon the statute of Elizabeth, and. how far they arise from its general jurisdiction as a court of equity to enforce trusts, and especially trusts to pious uses. (Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1142.) It is remarkable, says Judge Story, that Sir Thomas Egerton, (who was made Lord Chancellor in 39th Elizabeth,) and Lord Coke, who argued Porter\u2019s case for the Queen, although they cited many antecedent cases, refer to none which were not decided at law. (Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1144.) In the Attorney General v. Boxvyer, 3 Ves. 714, 726,) Lord Loughborough stated as the result of his researches, that until about the period of enacting the statute of Elizabeth, bills were not filed in chancery to establish charities. Lord Eldon, in Mills v. Farmer, (1 Meriv. 55,) said that he acceded fully to the remark of Sir Arthur Pigott in argument, that \u201c the difference between the case of individuals and that of charities is founded on a principle which has been established ever since the statute of charitable uses, in the reign of Elizabeth, and has been constantly acted upon from those days to the present.\u201d (Moggredge v. Thatchwell, 7 Ves. 36.) And in the case of The Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executor, (4 Wheat. 1,) Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the court, elaborately considered the whole subject, and investigated all the leading authorities. In that case the court arrived at the conclusion, \u201cthat charities, where no legal interest is vested, and which are too vague to be claimed by those for whom the beneficial interest was intended, could not be established by a court of equity, either exercising its ordinary jurisdiction, or exercising the prerogative of the king as parens patriae before the statute of Elizabeth.\u201d More recent examinations of the subject, however, would seem to lead to the conclusion that the court of chancery, prior to the statute of Elizabeth, exercised jurisdiction in cases of charities, and that this statute only created a new and ancillary jurisdiction. From the report of the commissioners on public records, published by the British parliament in 1827, it appears, by a number of instances previous to the statute, that cases where there were trustees appointed for general and indefinite, as well as for specific charities, were known to, acted upon and enforced in the court of chancery. (Story's Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1154. 1 Cooper's Public Records, 355) In 1826,. Lord Eldon, in the case of Attorney General v. Skinners' Co., (2 Russ. Ch. R. 407,) took occasion to express a doubt whether his former opinion had been strictly correct. Lord Redesdale, in 1827, in Attorney General v. Mayor, &c. of Dublin, (1 Bligh's Rep. N. S. 312, 347,) a case before the House of Lords, said that the statute of 43d Elizabeth created no new law on the subject of charitable uses. It created only a new and ancillary jurisdiction. Lord Chancellor Sugden, in the more recent case of The Incorporated Society v. Richards, (1 Drury & Warren's Rep. 258,) arrived at the conclusion, after full examination, \u201c that there is an inherent jurisdiction in equity in cases of charity, and that charity is one of those objects for which a court of equity has at all times interfered to make good that which at law was an illegal or informal gift, and that cases of charity in courts of equity in England were valid, independently of, and previous to, the statute of Elizabeth.\u201d And in a late case in the supreme court of the United States, Vidal, &c. v. Girard's Ex\u2019rs, (2 Howard's Rep. 127,) after an elaborate discussion, the court held that there was a jurisdiction in chancery over charitable trusts, antecedent to the statute of Elizabeth, and that although this statute was never in force in Pennsylvania, yet the common law of that state had always recognized the chancery jurisdiction in cases of charity. (See also 6 Paige, 649; 1 Molloy, 616; Duke on Charitable Uses, 136, 154, 163.) The better opinion, therefore, seems now to be, that independently of the statute of charitable uses, the English courts of equity possessed and exercised an inherent jurisdiction oyer charitable trusts, although formerly the contrary opinion had been held, and sustained by the highest authority.\nConceding, however, that all doubt is now at rest as to chancery exercising a sort of limited and imperfect jurisdiction over charities, prior and subsequent to the statute of Elizabeth, and independent of it, it is not to be controverted that the law of charities, as it prevailed in England and in the colony of hfewYork on the 19th of April, 1775, and which was a part of that common law which the constitution of 1777 recognized and adopted, was mainly if not exclusively founded upon and derived from the provisions of the statute of Elizabeth. Since that statute, Judge Story remarks, (and he is sustained by numerous authorities,) it is very certain that no bequests have been deemed within the authority of chancery, and capable of being established and regulated thereby, except bequests for those purposes which that statute enumerates as charitable, or which by analogy are deemed within its spirit and intendment. (Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1155.) At the period of the adoption of the constitution of 1777, the opinion was certainly universal, promulgated as it had been by distinguished equity judges themselves, after learned and extensive research, that the statute of Elizabeth was the fountain from which the authority and doctrine of chancery, in cases of charity, had exclusively sprung. There is no affirmative evidence that the statute of charitable uses was not in force in this state when a colony. The presumption is that it was. \u201cIt is a natural presumption,\u201d says Chancellor Walworth, in the case of Bogardus v. Trinity Church, (4 Paige, 198,) \u201c and therefore is adopted as a rule of law, that on the settlement of a new territory by a colony from another country, especially when the colonists continue subject to the same government, they carry with them the general laws of the mother country, which are applicable to the situation of the colonists in the new territory ; which laws thus become the laws of the colony until they are altered by common consent or by legislative enactment. The common law of the mother country, as modified by positive enactments, together with the statute laws which are in force at the time of the emigration of the colonists, become in fact the common law, rather than the common and statute law of the colony. The statute law of the mother country, therefore, when introduced into the colony of New-York by common consent, because it was applicable to the colonists in their new situation, and not by legislative enactment, became a part of the common law of this province.\u201d There is positive evidence that the British statutes of mortmain were in force in the colony. We have then the legal presumption in the one case, and positive knowledge in the other, that the statute of charitable uses, and the statutes of mortmain, were laws in force in the colony of New-York, together with the fact that at the adoption of the constitution of 1777, the opinion universally prevailed that the authority of chancery over charitable trusts, was the exclusive offspring of the first named statute, and had not grown out of the inherent jurisdiction of that court. We have also the further fact that if at any period in British jurisprudence her courts of equity exercised the power of establishing and enforcing general and indefinite charities, the law of charitable uses, as it prevailed in England and in the colony of New-York at the period of our revolution, was not the same which prevailed anterior to the statute of Elizabeth, but was a law which had been moulded and shaped by numerous adjudications of chancery under that statute; the court claiming and receiving its authority from the statute, and holding that nothing which was not within its purview was a charity. It may be, that looking at the provision of the constitution even under these circumstances, it is broad enough to embrace the adoption of those measurably undefined and unsystematized rules of the common law in relation to charities, including those which authorized a court of equity to carry them into effect, to be collected almost wholly from unreported precedents anterior to the 43d year of the reign of Elizabeth: but in view of the fact that until recently it was generally supposed that equity derived its exclusive jurisdiction and power to establish and enforce charities, as such, from the statute passed in that year, it is difficult to conclude that the legislature, in subsequently repealing the statute of Elizabeth, did not intend to abrogate the law of charities as it was understood to exist in England. If they did not, the strange inconsistency with which they acted is apparent. They retained the prohibition against corporations taking by devise, and limited the amount of property that religious corporations might hold ; yet they repealed, without re-enacting, the statute of 9 Geo. 2, ch. 36, and permitted persons in extremis to devise to individual trustees, for charitable uses, and create perpetuities. They approbated the policy of preventing the locking up of real property in perpetuity, while they did what could not fail to render that policy ineffectual. Perpetuities were to be protected if the devise was to individual trustees ; but otherwise, if to a corporation, though the mischief to be guarded against was the same in one case as in the other. Devises to charitable uses had been a most fruitful mode of creating perpetuities. This, experience had fully shown, insomuch that in Great Britain they were avoided by statute. Yet a republican state, in which the policy of restraining perpetuities was most obvious, removes the restraint by legislative action. These are some of the inconsistencies to be charged upon the legislature, if they did not intend, by abrogating the statute of Elizabeth, that the English law of charitable trusts, supposed by them to be founded upon it, should fall with it. (See opinion of Duer, J. in Ayres, &c. Executors, v. Trustees for the Corporation of Methodist Episcopal Church, N. Y. Legal Obs. vol. 8, p. 17.)\nBut assuming that the statute of Elizabeth never was in force in this state, or that it has been repealed; that by the common law of England and of this state when a colony, independent of any statute, charities could be established and enforced in equity; that such law became a part of the law of this state by constitutional adoption; and that anterior to the revised Statutes, (the legislature having repealed the statute of 9 Geo. 2, ch. 36,) perpetuities might be created through the medium of devises to charitable uses, the trust upheld and the charity established in a court ef equity; the question remains whether, under the provisions of the revised statutes respecting trusts and perpetu ities, the trust in the residue or surplus of the testator\u2019s estate is valid. This question may be considered in three aspects: 1. Do the provisions of the revised statutes refer to, or affect, charitable uses and trusts; and if so, does the trust under consideration, in relation to its object, conform to, or is it contrary to those provisions ? 2. Is the alienation of the real, and the dis-. position of the personal estate, suspended by the provisions of he will in respect to the disposition of the property of the testator for the establishment of a Polytechny, contrary to the provisions of the revised statutes'? 3. If the trust as to the real estate can not be supported, for want of valid objects, is there a power in trust by which the same objects can be attained ?\n1. All uses and trusts, except as authorized and modified in the article of the revised statutes, entitled \u201c Of uses and trusts are abolished. (1 R. S. 727, \u00a7 45.) No express trusts can any longer be created, except those enumerated in the 55th section of that article. In determining the question of the validity or invalidity of an express trust, we are to look to that section alone. If enumerated within its subdivisions, the trust is valid ; if not, it is illegal and void, unless capable of execution as a power in trust. (\u00a7 58.) The trust declared by the will of the testator, so far as it affects the residue of his real estate after payment of debts and legacies, is not authorized and defined by that section. The conclusion is that it is invalid; and this would seem to be conceded by the counsel for the trustees, if the statute has reference to, or affects, charitable uses and trusts. It is urged, however, that the article \u201c Of uses and trustsrelates only to private trusts, and that it was not intended to affect charitable uses or public trusts ; that the statute only refers to personal rights, and that the term uses employed in it, means such as can be enforced in favor of individuals. To ascertain the intention of the legislature in the enactment of a particular statute, courts are first to look at the words of it. These may be So simple, intelligible and unambiguous, as plainly to speak the legislative intent, leaving no room for construction. If so, we should go no further. It is not to be assumed in this case that the legislature, or those eminent and learned men who prepared the work of revision, were ignorant of such a thing as a charitable use, or a trust for charitable purposes; that with the knowledge that gifts and devises to charitable uses had been a popular and fruitful mode of tying up estates, they unintentionally overlooked them. \u201cUses and trusts, except as authorized and modified in this article, are abolished.\u201d No charitable trust is authorized. The language is plain, distinct, emphatic. The abolition is of all uses and trusts\u2014public or private\u2014except those which the statute allows. No other interpretation can be placed upon the words used. The intent is plainly signified, that there should be a thorough and radical reform in this branch of the law ; that there should be a total abrogation of express trusts, for any and every purpose, except as the legislature should authorize them. It is said that the statute refers to private trusts, such as may be enforced in favor of individuals. But the legislature have not said so, and courts are not to speak for them. Their language is that all trusts except those which are implied, and those expressly created to sell lands for the benefit of creditors, or to sell, mortgage or lease lands for the benefit of legatees or for the purpose of satisfying some charge thereon, or to receive the rents and profits of land, and either apply them to the use of a person, or accumulate them during minority, for the use of minors, are absolutely abolished. For us to interpolate another exception into the statute, would be to legislate, and that too on the supposition that neither the legislature nor the revisers, while providing a new system of uses and trusts, were aware that there was such a thing as a charitable use or trust, or that the law of charities had been and was an extensive branch of equity jurisdiction; or that knowing this, they unintentionally overlooked and omitted uses and trusts of a public and charitable nature. I am not willing to do this. It were better that we should abstain from legislation. If charitable uses and trusts should be excepted from the sweeping abolition made by the revision, the legislature alone is competent to do it.\nWhat I have said thus far is based upon the broad, emphatic and comprehensive words of the statute. Other views may be taken in connection with the words, to show that the legislature intended to embrace public as well as private trusts. The same mischief was to be guarded against in the one case as in the other. The same reasons of public policy were applicable to each. If by an executory devise or private trust the alienability of property could be suspended, and the same excluded from commerce, so it might be and had been in times past, through the instrumentality of a public and charitable trust. Indeed the chances that it would be in the latter way were most to be apprehended ; for apart from the imposition that may be successfully practiced upon men in a dying hour, there is a desire in human nature, evincing itself strongly in some, to win in their last moments, what perhaps they have failed through life to obtain, the applause of the world as public benefactors ; locking up their property and beggaring those connected with them by the ties of blood, to accomplish the end.\nAgain; the legislature have in some degree interpreted, by subsequent statutes, their intention, in the revision, to abolish public and charitable trusts, and to apply to them the statutory rules prohibiting perpetuities. In 1840, they provided that real and personal property might be granted and conveyed to any incorporated college or other literary incorporated institution in this state, in trust, 1st. To establish and maintain an observatory; 2d. To found and maintain professorships and scholarships ; 3d. To provide and keep in repair places for burial of the dead; 4th. For any other specific purposes, comprehended in the general objects authorized by their respective charters. So also they provided that real and personal estate might be granted and conveyed to the corporation of any city, or village, to be held in trust for any purpose of education, or the diffusion of knowledge, or the relief of distress, or for parks, gardens, or other ornamental grounds, or grounds for the purposes of military parade and exercise, or health and recreation, within or near such incorporated city or village; the trusts to continue for such time as might be necessary to accomplish the purposes for which they might be created. (Laws of 1840, chap. 318.) And in 1841, they provided, that devises and bequests of real and personal property in trust for any of the purposes for which such trusts were authorized under the law of 1840, and to such trustees as were therein authorized, should be valid, in like manner as if such property had been granted and conveyed according to the provisions of that law. (Laws of 1841, chap. 26.) Prior to these statutes, it is true, corporations had been prohibited from taking directly by devise, unless expressly authorized by their charters or by statute; though it was not clear that they might not take, through the intervention of individual trustees, previous to the adoption of the revised statutes. There was no prohibition against their taking directly by grant for any purposes comprehended in the general objects authorized by their charters. Why then specifically authorize them to hold property in trust for public and charitable uses, if the revised statutes had not referred to or affected such trusts 1 Or why specifically provide that the trust should continue for such time as might be necessary to accomplish the purposes for which it was created, if it had not been previously intended that trusts of the character authorized should be limited, not on contingent events, but on lives 1 Or why specifically authorize the creation of express trusts for the charities enumerated, if that class of trusts had not been affected by the revision of the statutes ?\nMy conclusion is, that trusts of real property, for charitable uses, are not valid in law unless of the description authorized by the statute of 1840, and made to such trustees as are therein authorized to hold. Nor can I say that I arrive at such a conclusion with regret; for trusts are not necessary for public charities ; direct grants are always better. This court has not heretofore been called upon to determine whether the provisions of the revised statutes referred to or affected this character of uses and trusts. What wc have upon that point is from Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford, and the superior court of the city of New-York; the former holding that the article of uses and trusts related only to private trusts ; the latter, that charitable uses and trusts were affected by it. (Shotwell v. Mott, 2 Sand. Ch. R. 46. Ayers et al. Ex'rs v. Trustees for the Corporation of the Methodist Episcopal Church et al., 8 N. Y. Legal Observer, 17.) Though entertaining a high respect for the Assistant Vice Chancellor as a learned and accomplished judge, I am compelled on this point to differ from him.\nII. The absolute power of alienation of an estate in lands is suspended when there are no persons in being by whom an absolute fee in possession can be conveyed. (1 R. S. 728, \u00a7 14.) This power of alienation can not be suspended, by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the creation of the estate. (1 R. S. 723 \u00a7 15.) The restrictions of the statute are equally applicable to present and to future estates. (16 Wend. 128,163. 14 Id. 265.) A similar rule is applied to personal property. The absolute ownership of personal property can not be suspended, by any limitation or condition whatsoever, for a longer period than during the continuance and until the termination of not more than two lives in being at the date of the instrument containing such limitation or condition; or if such instrument be a will, for not more than two lives in being at the death of the testator. (1 R. S. 773.) The provision is the same in effect as that relating to real estate; as absolute ownership implies the right of absolute disposal.\nThe testator\u2019s intention as evinced by his will, was that his debts and the legacies specifically given, should be first paid out of the trust property. To effectuate this intent he authorized his trustees to sell his real property, except his estate at Ohittenango and its vicinity. The latter estate was to be preserved, unless absolutely required to pay debts and legacies. The object, as he states, which he had in view in the purchase and extension of that property, was the establishment of the Polytechny, and he anxiously hoped that the derangement of his affairs and the extent of his debts might not require its abandonment.\nIf it should become necessary for the payment of debts and legacies to sell the Ohittenango estate or any part thereof, then the ground suitable for village lots should be sold, the trustees giving six months\u2019 notice, <fcc., and as the sale of village lots would always be necessary, as the testator supposed, for the advantage of the place, whether the proceeds were required for the payment of the debts or not, the trustees were to continue to sell all that might be required, and when such proceeds were not required to pay debts and legacies, they were to be invested for the support of the Polytechny. There is undoubtedly a valid express trust to pay debts and legacies, and all sales made for that purpose are valid. There is no question however upon this point, as it is conceded; and we are only asked to construe those parts of the will which relate to the disposition of the residue of his estate, after the payment of debts and legacies.\nThe will provides that if, after winding up and settling the affairs of the testator, the trustees ascertain that there are funds sufficient left to commence and found the school, they are to petition the legislature of this state to accept the devise for the object of endowing and supporting the Polytechny upon the testator\u2019s plan; to confirm its permanency by a legislative act, and make the necessary arrangements for its uniform and steady government. If such a law can not be obtained in this state, to the satisfaction of the trustees, then the residue of the testator\u2019s estate is to be disposed of, and the money received therefor invested, until the sum of $100,000 be funded, when the trustees are to form the institution in any state a majority of them please to select, which is willing to give the proper irrevocable legal guaranty for its performance, and appropriate not less than 1000 acres of land for the purpose.\nThe application of the property devised is postponed until the estate of the testator is settled, and it is ascertained that there is sufficient for the establishment of the school, and until the legislature of this state shall have passed a law accepting the devise, and made the necessary arrangements for the government of the school, to the satisfaction of the trustees. Until these conditions are performed, who are capable of conveying the property ? Not the trustees, if the trust be valid, and they take the estate; for any act of theirs in contravention of the trust is absolutely void. (R. S. 730, \u00a7 65. 14 Wend. 313.) Not the Polytechny; for it is not in existence. Not the state; for it has not accepted the devise. If it be the heirs at law of the testator, the estate must have descended to them for the reason that the devise is invalid. There is therefore a suspense of the power of alienation for an indefinite term, to wit, from the death of the testator, until the conditions precedent to the application of the residue are performed. Is this suspense legally limited 1 There can be no limitation of a term not measured by lives. Lives must be designated, and life must in some form enter into the limitation. (16 Wend. 133, 171, 172, 274. 20 Id. 506. 9 Paige, 521. 1 Denio, 57.) Here the suspense is limited by the happening of contingent events. There is a period between the testator\u2019s death and the time when an interest is to vest in the Polyteehny as a corporation, or in the state as a trustee or devisee, (already fourteen years,) not measured by any designated life or lives in being, but.by contingent events. Any possible limitation or condition which may suspend the power of alienation for a longer period than two lives in being at the creation of the estate, renders it void. No lives are designated, nor does life in any form enter into the limitation. The will contemplates the application of the fund, after the debts and legacies are paid, and therefore, after the expiration of the trust for that purpose; but if it may be made during that time, it may also be made, according to the will, after the term has expired. This the law will not permit; the rule being, that by no contingency whatever can the vesting possibly be suspended for any term not measured by lives. The power to sell the land is limited, by the evident intent of the testator, to a sale for the payment of the debts and legacies; and he clearly intended that the bulk of his land at Ohittenango should not be sold, if not required for that purpose, but should be retained as the site for the buildings necessary for the school, and for farms at which agricultural knowledge might be practically acquired by the students. But if included in the power, nothing would be gained in favor of the will, because, when the surplus was converted into personal estate, its absolute ownership (which means the right of absolute disposition,) would be suspended by the provisions referred to, for an indefinite term, and the will in that event would be equally invalid as if the surplus remained in land. The most general and comprehensive power of sale and exchange of the particular property devised, does not render it alienable in the sense of the statute, or of the rules against perpetuities ; those rules referring to the value or corpus of the property, whatever form it may assume, and being intended to prevent such value being locked up and excluded from commerce.\nThe will in this case suspends the power of alienation of the residue of the real estate and the disposition of the personal that may be accumulated by the sale of any part of such realty, for an indefinite term, to wit: from the testator\u2019s death until his affairs are wound up, and until it is ascertained that there is sufficient for the establishment of the Polytechny: and further, until the legislature of this state shall have accepted the devise, and made the necessary arrangements for the government of the school, to the satisfaction of the trustees. This is a limitation unauthorized by law. The law against the suspense of alienation of real or personal property, is ajjplicable to every species of conveyance and limitation, whether it be by deed or will; whether it be directly to a party competent to hold property, or indirectly in trust or to the use of such party, or to one hereafter to come into existence; and whether limited by an executory devise, or a springing use, and whether in the form of a power in trust, or of a legal express trust. If therefore, it be conceded that there is an express trust, or an executory devise, or a power in trust, with a valid and legitimate- object, for charitable uses, and in all other respects unexceptionable; yet the estate depending on conditions as to the time of vesting which suspend the alienation for a period not measured By\u00b0 a life or two lives in being, it is equally as void as if the object had been illegal.\nIt is urged that the devise being for a public charity, it does not fall within the restrictions of the statute respecting the creation of perpetuities. The testator has, by his will, created either a present or future estate in lands. If he has not, then the lands have descended to his heirs at law. All estates, by the statute, are void in their creation, if the absolute power of alienation is not limited according to law. The statute is general and comprehensive; there are no exceptions. But as I have before remarked, the mischief to be guarded against was quite as much to be apprehended through the instrumentality of devises to charitable uses, as in any other way. \u201c It is the very nature of such dispositions,\u201d says Lewis, \u201c to withdraw the subject of them from every kind of circulation, since a contrary course defeats their manifest object.\u201d\nIt is urged also, that here was a conditional devise to the state for the purpose specified in the will, and as such it was free from all legal objections. The state is not made either devisee or beneficiary. All the state has to do is to sanction and give the devise effect; and whatever it may do, if not approved by the trustees, is to be a nullity. But a perpetuity can not be created by a devise to the state, more than to individuals. Nor can the state, as was suggested on the argument, legalize or continue the devise so as to pass it into the hands of a corporation to be created by it in futuro. If, as the law existed at the death of the testator, the devise was invalid, and the estate descended to the heirs at law, no subsequent action of the legislature could legally divest them of it.\nIII. It is perhaps unnecessary that we should specifically inquire whether there is a power in trust in the will, by which the intention of the testator as to the remainder of his estate can be carried into effect; because upon the assumption that there is a power in trust, it would be subject to the same rules, as to the suspension of the power of alienation, as direct trusts. The real estate reserved for the school would descend to the heirs at law subject to the execution of the power. The testator\u2019s property would go to his heirs until the time arrived to establish and endow the Polytechny. Then by the execution of the power, the estate of the heirs would be divested. So long as such a power existed, an absolute fee could not be conveyed. The statute is, that alienation shall not be suspended by any limitation or condition whatever. If it can not be by an express trust or an executory devise, neither can it be by a power in trust. (1 R. S. 737, \u00a7\u00a7 128,129. Hawley v. James, 16 Wend. 135, 178. 14 Wend. 324.) But it is questionable whether the power contained in the devise is a power in trust at all, either general or special. There is no person or class of persons designated in whose favor the power can be executed.\nI am of the opinion that the trust created by the will of the testator, so far as relates to the residue of his estate after the payment of debts and specific legacies, is invalid, for the reasons, 1st. That the trust created is not authorized by law; 2d. That if it be regarded as an express trust or a power in trust, or an executory devise, the power of alienation is suspended for an indefinite term, not measured by a designated life or two lives in being, but by contingent events. The remainder of the real estate, after the payment of debts and legacies, descends to the heirs at law of the testator, and so much of the personal estate as has been accumulated and invested for the support of the Polytechny, by a sale of the real property at Chittenango, or which is not required for the payment of debts and legacies, ' passes to his next of kin.\nThere must be a decree declaring that the trust created by the testator\u2019s will, so far as its object is to pay the debts of the testator and the legacies specifically bequeathed, is valid; that the trust in the remainder of the testator\u2019s estate, having for its object the endowment and support of the Polytechny, is invalid, not being authorized by law, and suspending the power of alienation of an absolute fee in possession for an indefinite term, without reference to any designated life or two lives in being; that there be a reference to a competent person to take and state the account of the executors, and report thereon to the court, and on the- confirmation of such report, that a final decree be entered directing the distribution of the assets in hand, disposing of the shares and rights of the respective defendants in the real and personal estate of the testator, and settling all questions of costs and expenses, and out of what funds to be paid."},{"case_name":"Dickson et als. vs. Montgomery et als.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/11267621\/","date":"1851-12-01","court":"Tennessee Supreme Court","content":"Green, J.,\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\nThe facts disclosed in this record, raise the question, to what extent gifts for charitable uses can be supported in this State. And in order to a clear conception of the grounds of our judgment, it may not be amiss to state, in the outset, the principles which we consider to be settled by this court, as applicable to this subject.\nThe argument for the complainants assumes, that this court has held, that the court of chancery in this State, has no jurisdiction for trusts for charitable uses, unless the gift be to a party in esse, capable of sueing for the enforcement of the trust. We do not understand the case of Green vs. Allen, 5 Humph. Rep., 170, to hold this doctrine.\nIn that case the court maintains, that the court of chancery, in this State can exercise no other jurisdiction than that which was exercised by the Lord Chancellor in England, as an equity Judge, denominated his extraordinary jurisdiction. The common law jurisdiction, the statutory jurisdiction, and the specially delegated jurisdiction, of the Lord Chancellor, do not belong to our Chancellors. This proposition, is also maintained by this court, in the case of Oakley vs. Long, 10 Humph. R., 254. As a necessary consequence of this limitation of the jurisdiction of our court of chancery, it follows, that in all cases, where in England the jurisdiction of the Chancellor is exercised as the delegate of the crown, our court of chancery can afford no relief, but that our court of chancery has jurisdiction, in all cases, where in England, the Lord Chancellor in the exercise of his extraordinary jurisdiction, could have afforded relief.\nThis proposition is distinctly stated by Turley, Judge, in the case of Green vs. Allen, before referred to. In that case, at page 204, (5 Humph. R.,) after reviewing the state of the law on this subject in England, the Judge says, \u201cIf the charity be created either by devise or deed, it must be in favor of a. person having sufficient capacity to take, as devisee or donee, or if it be not to such person, it must be definite in its object, .and lawful in its creation, and to be executed and regulated by trustees, before a court of chancery can, by virtue of its extraordinary jurisdiction, interfere in its execution.\u201d\nIn the same case, page 206, the court in defining what part of the law of England on this subject is in force in Tennessee, say, \u201cWe are, therefore, of opinion, that an attempt by a court of chancery, in this State, to exercise jurisdiction over the subject of charities, beyond what would have been warranted by the extraordinary power of the Chancellor in England, is not justified by any of our statutes creating them, nor by the practice, nor by usage.\u201d\nThese paragraphs show, that the court in the case of Green vs. Allen, did not intend to restrict the exercise of jurisdiction by our chancery court, except, so far, as the want of \u201cmachinery,\u201d for a more enlarged exercise of it, might necessarily have that effect.\nCharities have been peculiarly favored by the courts, from the earliest period of the history of our law. Donations of this sort are usually made, for the advancement of education, morality and religion, and for the relief of the indigent, helpless and disabled; objects which must meet with favor in every civilized and Christian community. Hence, devises and gifts to charitable uses, have been sustained, in cases, where, if the trusts had been for other objeets, they would have been void for uncertainty.\nIn Story\u2019s Eq. Jurisp., \u00a7 1187, it is said, \u201cIt is clear, upon principle, that the court of chancery, merely in virtue of its general jurisdiction over trusls, independently of the special jurisdiction conferred by the statute of 43d Elizabeth, chap. 4, must in many cases, have a right to enforce the due performance of charitable bequests; for (as has been well observed,) the jurisdiction of courts of equity, with respect to charitable bequests, is derived from the general authority to carry into execution the trusts of a will or other instrum ent, according to the intention expressed in that will or instrument. We shall presently see, that this is strictly true in all cases, where the charity is definite in its objects, is lawful, and is to be executed and regulated by trustees, who are specially appointed for the purpose.\u201d Lord Eldon said, after a full review of the cases, that where there is a general indefinite purpose of charity, not fixing itself upon any particular object, the disposition and administration of it are in the King, by his sign manual. But where the gift is to trustees, with general objects, or with some particular objects pointed out, then the court of chancery will take upon itself the administration of the charity. Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 1190; Moggridge vs. Thackwell, 7 Vesey, 36, 75, 85, 86.\nAnd in Story\u2019s Eq. Jurisp., \u00a7 1191, it is said, \u201cWhere a charity is definite in its objects, and lawful in its creation, and it is to be executed and regulated by trustees, whether they are private individuals or corporations, there the administration properly belongs to such trustees; and the King as parens patrim, has no general authority to regulate or control the administration of the funds. In all such cases, however, if there be any abuse, or misuse of the funds by such trustees, the court of chancery will interpose, at the instance of the Attorney General, or the parties in interest, to correct such abuse, or misuse of the funds. But in such cases, the interposition of the court is properly referable to its general jurisdiction, as a court of equity, to prevent abuses of trust, and not to any original right to direct the management of a charity, or the conduct of the trustees. Indeed, if the trustees of the charity should grossly abuse their trust, a court of equity may go the length of taking it away from them, and commit the administration of the charity to other hands. But this is no more than the court will do, in proper cases, for any gross abuse of other trusts.\u201d\nThe foregoing quotations may suffice to show, that the settled rule in England, is, that if trustees are interposed to ex ecute and regulate the charity, and the objects are definite, and its creation lawful, the administration of the charity properly belongs to the trustees, and not to the King; and that the court of chancery, in virtue of the extraordinary jurisdiction, will interpose to correct any abuse of the trust. And it will also appear that in the case of Green vs. Allen, Judge Turley distinctly recognises the existence of this jurisdiction in our courts of chancery, to the full extent that it existed in the court of chancery in England, as a court of equity.\nBut it is argued for the complainants, that as in England nothing can be a charity which is not made such by the statute, 43d Elizabeth, chap., 4, and as that statute is not in force in this State, we cannot determine what gifts are, and what are no.t charities, and that the law of charities existing before that statute, was merged in its provisions, or became obsolete, and that there can be no charity independently of the statute, therefore, there can be no charity in this State, because the statute is not in full force here.\nThere are several satisfactory answers at hand, to this argument. In the first place, although the statute of 43d Eliz., chap. 4, is not in force here, it is not rendered inoperative by any repealing statute of our own, (as is the case in Virginia,) so that no aid can be derived from its provisions, but to use the language of Judge Turley, in Green vs. Allen, \u201cit is notin 1 orce because we have not the machinery necessary to carry it into execution.\u201d Or in the language of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, \u201cIt is so considered, rather on account of the inapplicability of its regulations as to the modes of proceeding, than in reference to its conservative provisions.\u201d Witman vs Lex, 17 Serg. & Rawle, 88; Zimmerman vs. Andres, (January term, 1844.)\nLord Rcdesdale, a great Judge in equity said, \u201cWe are re-fered to the statute of Elizabeth with respect to. charitable uses, as creating a new law upon the subject of charitable uses. That statute only created a new jurisdiction; iterated n ^ new law.\u201d Attorney General vs. Mayor Dublin, 1 Bligh R., 312, 347.\nIf the statute of Elizabeth created no new law, but only a new jurisdiction, its conservative provisions having been the law before the enactment of the statute, the consequence is, they became a part of the common law of this State. When, therefore, we disregard the statute as being inoperative here, we do so, only because we have \"not the machinery by which it was carried into execution. The regulations in reference to the new jurisdiction created by the statute, were inapplicable here, and hence, those regulations were not in force, but its provisions, that were law before its enactment, continue to be law, not because of the statute, but being unre-pealed, they do not cease to be law because they were embodied in a statute, which we cannot carry into effect, for want of the necessary machinery.\nAgain, if the provisions of this statute were law before its enactment, and were of equitable cognizance, the creation of a new jurisdiction, could not oust the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, as it existed before the statute, there being no provision in the statute, taking away that jurisdiction. Such new jurisdiction would be concurrent with the jurisdiction of the chancery court.\nIn suggesting, on the authority of Lord Redesdale, that the provisions of this statute, are law in this State, because they were law before the statute, it is not intended to intimate that the extravagant construction, which has been put upon its provisions in England, is to be regarded as law here; nor is it intended to weaken the case of Green vs. Allen, or to indicate that our courts of chancery can take cognizance of any trust for charitable uses, unless it be of such character as the court of chancery in England, in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction, would have interposed to protect. But the object has been to show, that the law of charities, where a trust is created, for lawful objects, definite in its character, and vested in trustees, so that it is properly cognizable in our own courts of chancery, has continued in existence from the earliest period in the history of our law, and is still in force.\nIt is said, we will be involved in inextricable difficulties, if we attempt to uphold gifts to charitable uses. That we have no rule to determine what would be a superstitious use, and what a valid charity.\nIt is certainly true, that gifts which in England are held to be invalid, as being made to superstitious uses, would not be such in this country, but it does not follow that all gifts professing to be for charity would be valid. If the object were illegal or in opposition to the policy of the State, of course the courts would refuse to lead their aid for such object; and it will be no more difficult to determine in such caso, whether the act be against law or public policy, than in many other cases, where the validity of the contract comes into question, as being illegal, or in opposition to public policy.\nHaving premised thus much, the following propositions may be stated, as being established.\n1st. The duties and powers which in England belong to the prerogatives of the crown, in reference to idiots, lunatics and charities, and which are vested in the Lord Chancellor, by the King\u2019s warrant, under his sign manual, do not exist in our chancery courts.\n2d. No powers other than those, which in England, were exercised by the Chancellor, by virtue of his extraordinary jurisdiction, exist in our chancery court.\n3d. Trusts for charitable uses, are favored by courts of equity, and will be supported in the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction of the chancellor in cases, where the trust would fail for uncertainty, were it not a charity.\n4th. If the fund be vested in a trustee, to be managed and controlled by him, for a lawful, definite, charitable use, the gift will be valid, though there be no person in being capable of sueing for the enforcement of the trust.\n5th. Such provisions of the statute of 43d Elizabeth, chap. 4, as were the law before the enactment of that statute, and which are applicable to our institutions, are in force here, as part of our common law, notwithstanding the statute is not in force.\nIt remains only to apply these principles to the legacies of this will. The bequest is, of seventy-four hundred dollars to the Treasurer of Clarke and Erskine College, and his successors in office in trust.\n1st. Two thousand dollars, for the endowment of the College.\n2d. Twenty-two hundred, for the benefit of Home Missions.\n3d. Twenty-two hundred dollars, for the benefit of Foreign Missions, and\n4th. One thousand dollars, for the education of indigent young men, who are preparing for the gospel ministry, in the Associate Reformed Church.\nThe sums given for home missions; for foreign missions; and for the education of indigent young men for the ministry; are to be held, and the interest applied to these objects under the direction of the Associate Reformed Synod of the South.\nIn relation to the gift for the endowment of Clarke and Ers-kine College, no serious objection is interposed by the counsel who have argued the case. And we think this bequest is unquestionably good.\nThere can b\u00e9 no doubt as to the institution for the benefit of which this endowment is intended. The words are, \u201cClarke and Erskine College, situated at due west corner, Abbeville District, South Carolina.\u201d\nIt has been seen that the institution of learning at that place, was incorporated in 1837, in the name and style of \u201cClarke and Erskine Seminary.\u201d This institution was established by and has been under the patronage and control of the Associate Reformed Synod of the South, of which church the testator was a member. The institution grew in importance and was organised as a college, and for some years before the date of the will had been called and known, as \u201cClarke and Erskine College.\u201d Now the testator uses the name by which the institution was familiarly known, and his description of the institution to which the bequest is made, and the fact as shown by the proof, that \u201cClarke and Erskine College\u201d and \u201cClarke and Erskine Seminary,\u201d are one and the same, leave no doubt as to the identity of the two in his mind.\nThe rule is so familiar, and so consonant with reason, that it needs no authority to support it, that where the name or description of a legatee is erroneous, and there is no reasonable doubt as to the person who was intended to be named or described, the mistake will not disappoint the bequest. The true intention of the testator may be ascertained, and the error corrected. 2 Williams on Executors, 736.\nThis bequest is, therefore, to an incorporated institution of learning for the endowment thereof, and is good and valid as if it had been a gift to a natural person.\nAs to the other three bequests, there is no doubt of their validity, upon the principles heretofore stated,\nIn 1849, and before the death of the testator, the Legislature of South Carolina granted a charter of incorporation, providing, \u201cThat the Associate Reformed Synod of the South, be and they are hereby authorized to nominate and appoint Doct. E. E. Pressly, Doct. James P. Pressly, Rev. R. C. Grier, James Lindsay, James Fare and Archibald Kennedy, trustees to serve during the pleasure of said Synod, who, with their successors similarly appointed from time to time, are hereby declared to be a body corporate and politic, by the name and style of \u2018Trustees for the Associate Reformed Synod of the South,\u2019 to hold and manage property, real, personal or mixed, or choses in action, of the value, at the time of acquisition, of three hundred thousand dollars,in trust for, and subject to the control and direction of said Synod; all or any of said trustees to be removed and others appointed in their place by said Synod at its pleasure.\u201d\nWe regard this charter, as a virtual incorporation of the \u201cAssociate Reformed Synod of the South.\u201d Its terms authorize the said Synod to appoint certain persons trustees, who are incorporated under the name of \u201cTrustees for the Associate Reformed Synod of the South,\u201d and the Synod is empowered to remove any or all said trustees at its pleasure, and to appoint others, and that the funds are to be held in trust for and subject to the control of the Synod. The bequest, therefore, of this charity to the \u201cAssociate Reformed Synod of the South,\u201d vests in the trustees, thus incorporated, a right to sue for and recover this fund, to be held by them, as their other funds are held, subject to the control of the Synod.\nAt any rate, the slight misnomer in the bequest, merely omitting the word \u201ctrustees,\u201d could not vitiate the gift, the intention of the testator being clear and unquestionable, but the bequest would be regarded as having been made to the \u201cTrustees of the Associate Reformed Synod of the South.\u201d\nBut it is objected that the bequests for the benefit of \u201cHome Missions,\u201d and of \u201cForeign Missions,\u201d are too vague and uncertain, and are therefore void.\nIt is certainly true that the individuals who may receive any part of this fund as compensation for labor as missionaries, are not designated or known; nor are the persons designated who may be benefitted by the ministry of these missionaries; but if this objection were allowed to prevail, it would defeat all charities, for it is of the very nature of a charity, that the individual beneficiaries of the charity are unknown. The gift for such purpose, is of the nature of a power of appointment, and being controlled and administered by trustees, and the objects definite, it is valid. If a gift were made to trustees, for the benefit of the Protestant Orphan Asylum of Nashville, no one would doubt of its validity, and yet what orphan could claim that he was a beneficiary, until his introduction into the Asylum.\nThe religious denominations of Christian countries, we know, are engaged by means of funds contributed by their communities, in the propagation of the gospel, among the heathen in foreign countries, and this is termed a \u201cForeign Mission,\u201d and they are engaged in like manner, in supplying the destitute in their own country with the gospel, and this is termed a \u201cHome Mission.\u201d These terms are as well understood, and have as definite a meaning as any other terms in the language.\nThe bequests of this will are, therefore, in our opinion, valid, and we so decree."},{"case_name":"White vs. Fisk and others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/438333\/","date":"1852-06-01","court":"Connecticut Supreme Court","content":"Church, C. J.\nAlate writer on the law of devises has remarked, that gentlemen of the legal profession should seldom draw up their own wills, as many such have been the subjects of litigation, and of the most difficult interpretation. The propriety of this suggestion is, in some degree, verified in this case.\nThe late Judge Hitchcock, whose will we are considering, was one of the most learned and distinguished members of the Connecticut bar; and yet, we find his executor, and trustee, himself also a lawyer of great ability and professional experience, presenting this will to this court, and asking its direction, how he may safely execute .the duties and trusts imposed upon him by it. Under such circumstances, we too may well doubt what advice to give.\nThere are several prominent facts apparent as well on the face of the will, as disclosed by the evidence, properly admitted by the superior court, which have an important bear ing upon its construction and its application to the testator\u2019s family and estate. He seems to have believed, that the annual income of his property would be about one thousand dollars, and to have assumed this, as a proximate basis of his bequests to his children, apparently so scanty, when in truth, this income proved to be more than double that sum. Aside from his bequest to the Domestic Missionary Society of Connecticut, he has made no ultimate disposition of any part of his own property, but has confined himself to the bestowment of its supposed annual income, leaving the principal, apparently unthought of, or at any rate undisposed of, expressly or by any appropriate language used by him.\nThe sons and daughters named in the will, wrere the testator\u2019s children by a former wife. By his surviving widow, Narcissa P. Hitchcock, he had a son Samuel W. Hitchcock, and his wife Narcissa had several children by a former husband ; all these survived the testator, and are claimants under his will, and respondents in this bill.\nHe seems also to have forgotten, that some of his children by his first marriage, named in his will, might die, leaving children, and be left unprovided for, while the trusts in his will continued, as has already proved true, as we are informed, since the arguments in this case were heard by us.\nThe testator was a member of a Congregational church in New Haven, and so were both the persons constituted by him to be the executors and trustees of his will.\nThe provision-for the daughters, Laura and Mary, is quite intelligible, although a seeming obscurity is thrown over it by the language, \u201c such as may be needed to support them comfortably in health,\u201d &c., which .may seem to imply a power and discretion in the trustees, to examine constantly the exact \u2019necessities of these children, and measure their disbursements accordingly, or even to reduce them to nothing, if the children, by marriage or otherwise, should be raised above want or actual indigence, thereby depriving them entirely of this parental bounty. We do not believe the testator intended any such thing; and we think this should be considered and treated as an absolute bequest of two hundred and fifty dollars annually to each of these daughters, so long as both should live, and as much more to each one respectively, as might be necessary to defray the cost and charges of her sickness; and upon the death of either, that the survivor should receive three hundred and fifty dollars, or one hundred dollars in addition to the sum first given, annually, during her life, with the same allowance for sickness expenses. Laura has since died; upon which event, Mary, the survivor, became, and is, entitled to, the aforesaid sum of three hundred and fifty dollars, and sickness expenses. The sums thus specified, the testator supposed necessary to support these daughters comfortably in health.\nThe bequests of income to the two sons of the testator, George and Charles, are equally free from doubt. To each, the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars annually, during their lives, and five hundred dollars to the surviving son. And then, if only one of these four children shall survive the rest, he shall be entitled to the sum of six hundred dollars annually, and no more, for his life, unless sickness shall require a larger sum. Since the testator\u2019s death, his eldest son has deceased, and the survivor, since then, has been entitled to receive five hundred dollars per annum.\nIt will be seen, that in making all these bequests to these four children of his first wife, they are given for their respective lives, no part or portion going over to their children or heirs.\nWe can not believe that Judge Hitchcock intended to disinherit such lineal descendants; and we should very reluctantly be brought to give a construction to this will, which would produce such a result.\nWhether the bequest to the young men, hereafter to be noticed, be valid or void, it becomes necessary to determine by what rule the testator intended the amount of it to be annually ascertained. The clause in the will referring to this subject, is, that \u201cAny surplus income that may remain, to the extent of one thousand dollars per annum, 1 direct to be expended, by my said trustees, for the support of indigent pious young men, preparing for the ministry in New Haven;\u201d from which it has been inferred, that one thousand dollars of such surplus income, if so much there should be, was intended for this object; but the next following clause of the will shows, we think, that such was not the purpose of the testator; for in it, he says, that \u201c If the net annual income of my estate, as' above settled, should at any time exceed one thousand dollars, then the surplus income I direct to be paid in equal portions to the children of my present wife;\u201d from which it is obvious, that he intended that one thousand dollars should satisfy the legacies before given to his four children, and also the bequest to the indigent young men, because he gives the surplus beyond that to an entirely different class of legatees\u2014his wife\u2019s children. We think, therefore, that the sum intended for the indigent young men, was the annual difference between the sums expended upon the testator\u2019s four children above named and one thousand dollars. Such sum or difference, if this bequest be valid, is payable to them, and if not, it is intestate, undisposed of by the will, and is payable to the heirs of the testator.\nA more interesting and perplexing inquiry than any other suggested by this will, is, whether this bequest to the \u201c pious indigent young men\u201d can be sustained and carried into effect ? All the parties who, on this record, make claim before us, unite in saying that it can not. And the trustee only asks us, whether it can? We think it cam not be sustained.\nAnd while we acknowledge the benevolent and charitable intention of the testator in this gift, and the laudable purpose he conceived, we can not see how, confining ourselves within what we believe to be our legitimate powers of interpretation and judgment, we can carry that intention into effect.\nThis legacy is not given to any college or institution, nor to any association of persons corporate or voluntary; nor is any such alluded to, by which the charity can be dispensed; but only as a legal interest to trustees, to be sure, to* be ex pended or disbursed for the support of individuals, each one of whom falling within the description named, has an equita ble or beneficial interest in the fund, and which he must have a right to enforce, if any one can. And who are these individuals ? They are the indigent pious young men, preparing for the ministry in New Haven. The difficulty of carrying this provision into effect, is as great as if no trustee had been appointed; for no rule of determination, selection or apportionment, is furnished by the will, and no positive or discretionary power of determination, &c., bestowed.\nIt has been suggested, that the power of selecting the beneficiaries under this bequest, and of apportioning the sums of money annually to be disbursed among them, is in the trustees. We do not so understand it. Their only power is to expend the money\u2014to pay it out, to the persons entitled, under the will, to receive it. Such a power can not legally be inferred from the fact, that the testator, and the trustees appointed by him, were members of a Congregational church in New Haven; and for us to infer it from this fact, would be to substitute a very liberal conjecture, in the place of legitimate interpretation of language and legal judgment.\nWho, then, are entitled to this bequest; or, if the trustees have the power suggested, how can they exercise it ? What is meant by \u201cindigent young men ?\u201d No rule of discrimination is given. And who but Him that knoweth the heart can determine, who are the pious ones intended by the testator ? Surely, he did not intend all who merely make professions of piety. And what was meant, by preparing for the ministry in New Haven? Was it a preparation, by a course of theological or academical study ?\nIf a bequest, for the purpose indicated in this will, in this respect, had been made to a college, a theological institute\u2014 the Congregational society of which the testator was a member\u2014or other body which had, or might have, a supervision or interest in the general object of this charity, and rules for its management, it would have presented a very different case; but as it is, we think the provisions of this will in this matter, have been left by the testator quite too loose and indefinite for judicial action.\nOur statutes of descent and distribution have established rules for the distribution of estates, founded upon what are supposed to be the ordinary principles and. impulses of natural affection and of equity ; and, in the absence of other evidence, these may well be followed, as the best exponents of intention.\nEvery man has a right, by his last will and testament, to change these laws in his own case, and make a law for himself, if he will; but to do this effectually, he must not only observe prescribed formalities with exactness, but he must speak in a manner leaving no reasonable dbubt of his purpose ; and if he does not do this, the general and prescribed laws should be permitted to have their just and equitable effect.\nThere is a class of cases, the authority of which we recognize, where the individual beneficiaries under a will, but included in a definite class, are left uncertain, and yet the bequest for their benefit has been sustained. But these are cases, where the gift has been t.o some corporate or voluntary association, whose business and duty it becomes, to dispense the charity; or where power is very certainly conferred by the will, upon the executor, trustee, See., to discriminate and select, or to apportion the application of the funds. Such was the case of Bull v. Bull, 8 Conn. R., 48, in which a remainder was bequeathed to executors, in trust for the most needy of the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters, with express authority and power to the executors to make distribution to the most needy, according to their best discretion. \u201c Here,\u201d says the court, \u201c a rule is given by which the persons cari be designated\u201d\u2014the most needy.\nThe same discretionary power was expressly conferred in the cases of Gower v. Mainwaring, 2 Ves., 87; Moggridge v. Thackwell, 7 Ves., Jr., 36; 13 ib., 416; Attorney General v. Price, 17 ib., 371; Witman v. Lex, 17 Serg. & Rawle, 91; in which last case, the court recognizes the principle, that bequests for uncertain objects, &c., may be sustained, where there is a discretionary power vested anywhere over the application of the charity. 9 Ves., 399. 10 id., 522. 1 Sim. Stu., 69. But no such discretionary power, as we believe, is given by this will.\nOur courts have recognized the validity of charitable be \u201c quests, not only where the gifts have been to a person or corporation, having a legal capacity to take, but also to voluntary unincorporated associations existing for benevolent or charitable purposes, and have supplied these latter with trustees to receive, hold and manage the funds given for the uses designated, even though these were somewhat undefined and uncertain. And so also, bequests to individuals or classes of individuals, in nature of charities, where the testator has clearly given a power to some person or persons, to exercise a discretionary authority in their management, so that uncertainty may be made certain ; and it is believed .that we have gone no further in this direction. American Bible Society v. Wetmore, 17 Conn. R., 182. Bull v. Bull, 8 Conn. R., 48. Burr v. Smith; 7 Vt. R., 241. Reformed Dutch Church v. Mott et. al., 7 Paige Ch., 77. Inglis v. Sailor's Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 99.\nOur revised statute (tit. Land, 454) recognizes these charitable and pious purposes and uses, and protects them ; but it seems, by fair intendment, to require that they shall be reasonably certain and definite; for its language is, they \u201c shall ever remain to the uses to which they have been, or shall be, given or granted, according to the true intent and meaning of the grantor, and to no other use whatever.\u201d To carry out this provision of the law, the intention of the donor must be certain, as well as the objects of his bounty reasonably definite, and the charity confined to the very use to which it was destined.\nThere may be other cases in this country, and there certainly are many in England, in which charities, more equivocal and uncertain than the one we are considering, have been sustained; but we are persuaded that this has been done either avowedly, or under the influence of the principie of cy pres. Several such cases have been brought to jour notice on this argument; but we repel the authority of jihem, as we have not adopted that, principle into our system i'ef jurisprudence. We think it inconsistent with the limited and defined powers of the judiciary, as understood and approved in this state.\nBy the theory of the English constitution and laws, the king is parens patriae, the guardian of infants, the dispenser of charities, and his chancellor, as the keeper of his conscience, acts in his stead. The doctrine of cy pres, is a doctrine of prerogative ; and it seems to be this, that if it can be seen that a charity was intended, by a testator, but the object specified can not be accomplished, the funds may be applied to other charitable purposes, or that the chancellor may seize them as a sort of waif, and apply them as his, or the king\u2019s good conscience, shall direct. 2 Sto. Eq., 424, \u00a7 1182. In this way the chancellor substitutes himself in the donor\u2019s place, and really makes the will himself. This doctrine is inconsistent with the plain provisions of our statute, above referred to, on this subject, and which forbid the perversion of the charity; and the English judges have themselves expressed fears of the tendency of the power.; \u201c This doctrine,\u201d says Lord Kenyon, in Brudenell v. Elewes, 1 East, 451, \u201chas not been much approved, and we must see that it does not run wild;\u201d and Lord Chancellor Eldon, in 7 Yes., 399, says, \u201c it is not proper to extend it one step further.\u201d 1 Maddock\u2019s Ch., 49.

Hart, 4 Wheat., 1.\nIt is true, that the later cases in England have modified, in some measure, the former extreme administration of the principle of cy pres.\nThe charity intended for the indigent young men, being, in our opinion, too vague and uncertain for. effect, a question is suggested here\u2014to whom shall the moneys intended for them be paid 1\nThe testator has directed, that the surplus income of his estate, beyond one thousand dollars, shall be paid, in equal portions, to the children of his then present wife, Narcissa, and their heirs. But it is evident, that the testator did not intend, that any portion of this one thousand dollars should go to the children of his wife\u2014there being no unexpended residuum of this sum. It must therefore, as we have already intimated, be treated as intestate, and be distributed to the testator\u2019s heirs. Green v. Dennis, 6 Conn. R., 292. Brewster v. McCall\u2019s Devisees, 15 Conn. R., 274. Baker v. Hall, 12 Ves., 497. Jones v. Mitchell, 1 Sim. & St., 290.\nThis trust is not a perpetual one, and was not so intended. The chief object of the testator in creating it, was, that his first four children should be provided for, from the annual income of his property, during their lives; and he looked to the 1000 dollars for this purpose, and all beyond, he considered as uncertain; and yet directed, if there should be a surplus income, above the 1000 dollars, that such surplus should be annually paid to the children of his wife, Narcissaj and their heirs. But we think it obvious, from the whole tenor of the will, that he did not intend that these annual payments should continue, beyond the time when there was no one surviving, who could take any part of the first thousand dollars. If he did, the bequest would be, that this annual income of 1000 dollars would be an accumulating fund forever, with no one to take it; and the principal of the estate must remain, too, as a fund to raise the surplus income for the children of his wife, Narcissa, and their heirs.\nWe do not suppose this was intended by the testator; and if it was, such purpose can not be executed. The law will not sanction a perpetuity, thus created for a private interest, and not for a charity. 1 Jarman on Wills, 219, 264.\nIf the trust expires, upon the death of the survivor of the testator\u2019s children by his first marriage, his intention in respect to all his children will best be fulfilled. If there be a surplus beyond the annual income of one thousand dollars, while the trust continues, all the children will receive their respective portions of income at the hands of the trustees, according to the provisions of the will, as we understand them, and according cto law; and upon the death of such survivor, the entire estate or principal fund remaining, not having been ]ry the will in any way disposed of, will go to the heirs general of the deceased, in fee.\nThe result of the views we have expressed, will lead us to the following advice, to wit: That from the net annual income of the estate in the hands of, or subject to, the trustee, he pay to Mrs. Mary Sherwood, the surviving daughter of the testator, during her life, the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars annually, for her sole and separate use; and in case of sickness, such further annual sum as may be necessary, to defray the cost and charges of such sickness.\nAnd to Charles Hitchcock,the surviving son of the'testator by his first marriage, subject to the aforesaid payment to Mary Sherwood, the sum of five hundred dollars annually, during his life; and in case of the death either of the said Mary or Charles, then to the survivor of them, during his or her life, the sum of six hundred dollars annually, and such additional sum as the sickness of such survivor shall require.\nAnd also, if said income shall be more than sufficient to make the aforesaid payments, then the sum or balance remaining, or the difference between what may be necessary to make such payments, and the sum of one thousand dollars in any year, such sum or difference to be paid to the heirs at law of the testator.\nAnd if the net annual income of said estate has exceeded, or shall exceed, the sum of one thousand dollars in any year, such surplus income, beyond one thousand dollars, to be paid to the children .of Narcissa P. Hitchcock, the surviving widow of the testator, in equal portions, and to their heirs annually, so long as the said Mary Sherwood or Charles Hitchcock shall live. But, upon the death of both the said Mary Sherwood and Charles Hitchcock, said trust to cease and be determined, and the estate of the testator, then remaining in trust in the hands of the trustee, to be distributed in fee, to the heirs at law of the said Samuel J. Hitchcock.\nIn this opinion the other Judges concurred.\nDecree accordingly.\n*\nIt is understood, that since the argument and decision of this case, Mrs, Sherwood has deceased, leaving a child or children."},{"case_name":"William Fontain, Administrator de bonis non cum testa mento annexo of Frederick Kohne, deceased, Appellant v.

In his will, he declared himself to be of the city of Philadelphia.\nAfter giving sev\u00e9ral annuities to his wife and others, and legacies to his friends in this country and in foreign countries, to charitable objects, and providing for the payment of them, he declares: \u201c Forasmuch as there will be a surplus income of my estate, beyond what will be necessary to pay my said wife\u2019s annuity and the, other annuities, I do therefore direct my said executors to - invest the said surplus income, and all accumulation of interest arising from that source yearly, for and during all the term of the natural life of my said wife, in the purchase of such stocks or securities of the United States, or the State of Pennsylvania, or of any other State or States of the United States, or of the city of Philadelphia, bearing an interest, as they, in their discretion, may see fit; and from and immediately after the decease of my said wife, then all the rest, residue, ancl remainder of all my estate, including the fund which shall have arisen from the said surplus income aforesaid, after payment of the legacies hereinbefore directed to be paid, after the decease of my said wife, arid providing, for the payment of the annuities hereinbefore giveri, of those annuitants who may then be -till living, I authorize and empower my executors or the sur vivor of them, after the decease of my said wife, to dispose of the same for the use .of such charitable institutions in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, as they or he may deem most beneficial to mankind, and so that part of the colored population in each' of the said States of Pennsylvania and South Carolina shall partake of the benefits thereof.\u201d His wife, Eliza Kohne, John Bohlen, and Robert Vaux, of the city of Philadelphia, and Robert Maxwell, of the city of Charleston, were appointed executors.\nMrs. Kohne survived her co-executors some years, and then died, having made her last will and testament, and appointed James L. Petigru and William -Ravenel, the defendant, executors, the latter of whom obtained letters testamentary in the county of Philadelphia. And on the 15th of October, 1852, William Fontain, the complainant, obtained letters of administration de bonis non, on the estate of Frederick Kohne, deceased, he being the nearest of kin to the deceased, and one of his heirs at law.\nThe bill is filed in the name of the complainant, by certain charitable societies of Pennsylvania and South ^Carolina, under the directions of the will, to recover from the defendant, as executor of Mrs. Kohne, so much of the property as came to her hands as the executrix of her husband\u2019s will, and which she distributed, as undisposed-of property, after the death .of her co-executors. And the question in the case is, whether the residuary bequest in the will, whiph authorized his executors, or the survivor of them, after the death of his wife, to dispose of the surplus \u201c for the use of such charitable institutions in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, as they might deem most beneficial to mankind,\u201d has lapsed, no such appointment having been made, or attempted to be made, during the lifetime of the executors. This part of the property is understood to have amounted to a large sum.\nThe domicile of the testator, at the time of his death, seems not to be a controverted question. He had so lived in the two States of Pennsylvania and South Carolina, and amassed-property in.both, that his domicile might be claimed in either. There is no evidence in which, if in either, he exercised the right of suffrage. For two years previous to his death, he resided in Pennsylvania.\nThe bequest under consideration was intended to be a charity. The donor, having entire confidence in his executors, substituted their judgment for his own. They, or the survivor of them, was to designate such objects of his charity in the two States, \u201c as would be most beneficial to mankind.\u20195 It was to be placed on the broadest foundations of human sympathy, not excluding the colored race. It is no charity to give to a friend. In the books, it is said the thing given becomes a charity where the uncertainty of the recipients begins. This is beautifully illustrated in the Jewish law, which required the sheaf to be left in the field, for the needy and passing stranger.\nIt may be admitted that this bequest would be executed in England. A charity rarely, if ever, fails in that country. The only question there is, whether it shall be administered by the chancellor, in the exercise of his ordinary jurisdiction, or under the sign-manual of the crown. Thus furnished with the judicial and prerogative powers, the intent of the testator, however vaguely and remotely expressed, if it be construed into a charity, effect is generally given to it. It is true, this is not always done in the spirit of the donor; for sectarian prejudices, or the arbitrary will of the king\u2019s instruments, sometimes pay little or no regard to the expressed will of the testator.\nThe appellants endeavor to sustain this charity under the laws of Pennsylvania. This is according to the course of the court. The case of The Philadelphia Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat. 1, was decided under the laws of Virginia, which had repealed the statute of 43 Elizabeth. In Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. 566, the pious use of a burial-ground was sustained under the bill of rights of Maryland. The case of Wheeler v. Smith, 9 How. 55, was ruled under the laws of Virginia. And in the case of Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors, the laws of Pennsylvania governed.\nIn Wheeler v. Smith, this court said, when this country achieved its independence, the prerogatives of the crown devolved upon the people of the States. And this power still-remains with them, except so far as they have delegated a portion of it to the federal government. The sovereign will is made known to us by legislative enactment. The State, as a sovereign, is the parens patries.\nThere can be no doubt that decisions have been made in this country, on the subject of charities, under the influence of English decrees, without carefully discriminating whether they resulted from the ordinary exercise of chancery powers, or the prerogatives of the crown.\nThe courts of the United States cannot exercise any equity powers, except those conferred 'by acts of congress, and those judicial powers which the high court of chancery in England, acting under its judicial capacity as a court of equity, possessed and exercised, at the time of the formation of the constitution of the United States. Powers not judicial, exercised by the chancellor merely as the representative of the sovereign, and by virtue of the king\u2019s prerogative as parens patriae, are not possessed by the circuit courts.\nIn 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 1189, it is said: \u201c But as the court of chancery may also proceed in many, although not in all, cases of charities by original bill, as well as by commission under the statute of Elizabeth, the jurisdiction has become mixed in practice ; that is to say, the jurisdiction of bringing informations in the name of the attorney-general, has been mixed with the jurisdiction given to the chancellor by the statute. So that it is not always easy to ascertain in what cases he acts as a judge, administering the common duties of a court of equity, and in what cases he acts as a mere delegate of the crown, administering its peculiar duties and prerogatives. And again, there Is a distinction between cases of charity, where the chancellor is to act in-the court of chancery, and cases where the charity is to be administered by the king, by Ms sign-manual. But in practice the cases have often been confounded, from similar causes.\u201d\n\u201c It is a principle in England, that the king, as parens patrice, enforces public charities, where no other person is intrusted with the right. Where there is no trustee, the king, by his lord chancellor, administers the trust, as the keeper of the king\u2019s conscienceand it is not important whether the chancellor acts as the special delegate of the crown, or the Icing acts under the sign-manual, his discretion being guided by the chancellor.\u201d\nIt may be well again to state the precise question before us. \u201c The executors, or the survivor of them, after the decease of \u2022 the testator\u2019s wife, was authorized to dispose of the property, for the use of such charitable institutions in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, as they or he may deem most beneficial to mankind.\u201d\nNo special trust is vested in the executors, by reason of this power of appointment. It is separable and distinct from their ordinary duties and trust as executors. It was to be exercised after the death of Mrs. Kohne; but the executors died before her decease, and consequently they had no power to make the appointment. The conditions annexed by the testator rendered the appointment impossible. Had the contingency of the death of Mrs. Kohne happened, as the testator from her advanced age contemplated, during the life of the executors or the survivor of them, the appointment might have been made at his or their discretion. But had they or the survivor of them failed to make it, it might have become a question whether he or they could have been coerced to do so by the exercise of' any known chancery power in this country. The will contained no provision for such a contingency, and it could not be brought under the trust of executorship. Chancery will not compel the execution of a' mere naked power. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 169. \u00a1But it will, tmder equitable circumstances^ aid a defective execution of a power. A power when coupled with a trust, if not executed before the death of the trustee, at law the power is extinguished, but the trust, in chancery, is held to survive.\nThe testator was unwilling to give this discretion to select the objects of his bounty, except to his executors. He relied on their discrimination, their judgment, their integrity, and fitness, to carry out so delicate and important a power. He made no provision for a failure, in this respect, by his executors or the survivor of them, nor for the contingency of their deaths before Mrs. Kohne\u2019s decease. They died before they had the power to appoint, and now what remains of this bequest, on which a court of chancery can act ?\nThere must be some creative energy to give embodiment to an intention which was never perfected. Nothing short of the prerogative power, it would seem, can reach this case. There is not only uncertainty in the beneficiaries of this charity, but behind that is a more formidable objection. There is no expressed will of the testator. He intended to speak through his executors or the survivor of them, but by the acts of Providence this has become impossible. It is then as though he had not spoken. Can any power now speak for him, except the parens patria? Had he declared'that the residue of his estate should be applied to certain charitable purposes, under the statute of 43 Eliz., or on principles similar to those of the statute, effect might have been given to the bequest, as a charity, in the State of Pennsylvania. The words as to the residue of his property were used in reference to the discretion to be exercised by his executors. Without their action, he did not intend to dispose of the residfie of his property.\nIt is argued, \u201c that in England the chancellor, in administering charities, acts as the delegate of the' crown, inasmuch as he discharges all his judicial, functions in that capacity.\u201d If, by this, it is intended to assert that the chancellor, in affixing the dgn-manual of the king, or when he acts under the cy pres power, is in the discharge of his ordinary chancery powers, it does not command our assent.\nThe statute of 43 Eliz., though not technically in force in Pennsylvania, yet, by common usage, and constitutional recognition, the principles of the statute are acted upon in cases involving charities. Witman v. Lex, 17 Serg. and Rawle, 88.\nIn the argument, the case of Moggridge v. Thaekwell, 7 Ves. 86, was cited, as identical with the case before us. \u201c The only difference between the case and this one, it is said, is, that in the former the devise was for objects not defined, as they are in this case.\u201d In this the counsel are somewhat mistaken, as the case of Moggridge will show.\nThe devise in the will of Ann Cam was: \u201c And I give all the rest and residue of my personal estate unto James Vaston, of Clapton, Middlesex, gentleman, his executors and administrators, desiring him to dispose of the same in such charities as he shall think fit, recommending poor clergymen who have large families and good characters; and I appoint the said John Maggridge and Mr. Vaston, before mentioned, executors of this my will.\u201d\nIn the final decree, \u201c upon a motion to vary the minutes, Lord Thurlow declared, that the residue of the testatrix\u2019s personal estate passed by her will, and ought to go and be applied to charity,\u201d &c.\nNow here was a trust created not only in Vaston, but in his executors and administrators, to whom the residue of the estate was bequeathed for the purposes of the charity. In this view, Lord Thurlow might well say, \u201cthe residue of the personal estate passed by the will.\u2019.\u2019 This was true, though Vaston was dead when the will took effect. This being the case, it is difficult to say that that case is identical with the one before us.\nThe case of Moggridge v. Thackwell was before Lord Eldon on a rehearing. He entered into a general view of the subject of charities, by the citation of authorities which showed the unreasonableness of the doctrine maintained by the courts, the inconsistencies in the decisions in such cases,'and the gross perversions of charities by the exercise of the prerogative power; but at last he says : \u201c Therefore I rather think the decree is right. I have conversed with many upon.it. I have great difficulty in my own mind, and have found great difficulty in the mind of every person I have consulted; but the general principle thought most reconcilable to the cases is, that where there is a general indefinite purpose, not fixing itself upon any object, as this in a degree does, the disposition is in the king by sign-manual; but where the execution is to be by a trustee, with general or some objects pointed out, there the court will take the administration of the trust. \u25a0 But,\u201d he observes, \u201c it must be recollected that I am called upon to reverse the decree of a predecessor, and of a predecessor who, all the reports inform us, had great occasion to consider this subject. I should hesitate with reference to that circumstance; but where authority meets authority, and precedent clashes with precedent, I doubt whether I could make a decree more satisfactory to my own ihind than that which has been made.\u201d\nIt will be perceived that this decision was made reluctantly, and after much balancing of the law and the force of jrrecedentsj and chiefly; as it would seem, in respect to the decree of Lord Thurlow. This decision of Lord Eldon was made in 1802, and it is not known to have been recognized in this country.\nNeither the doctrines on which this decision is. founded, nor the doubts expressed by the chancellor, are calculated very strongly to recommend it to judicial consideration. The case, however, is different from the one before us, in this : the residuary estate of Mrs. Cam passed to the trustee; that of Mr. Kohne remained as a part of his estate in the hands of the executors, and descended to his heirs at law on the death of Mrs. Kohne. ' The beneficiaries were not more definitely described in the one case than in the other. In Kohne\u2019s case no trust was created, except that which was connected with the executorship.\nWhere there is nothing more than a power of appointment conferred by the testator, there is nothing on which a trust, on general principles, can be fastened. The power given is a mere agency of the will, which may or may not be exercised at the discretion of the individual. And if there be no act on his part, the property never having passed out of the testator, it necessarily remains as a part of his estate. To meet such cases, and others, the prerogative power of the Ung, in England, has been invoked, and he, through the chancellor, gives effect to the charity.\nIt would be curious, as well as instructive, on a proper occasion, to consider the principles, if principles they can be called, which were first applied in England to charities. Their most learned chancellors express themselves, in some degree, as ignorant on this subject. Lord Eldon said, in the case of Maggridge, \u201c in what the doctrine originated, whether, as Lord Thurlow supposed, in the principles of the civil law, as applied to charities, or in the religious notions entertained formerly in this country, I know not; but we all know there was a period when a portion of'the residue of every man\u2019s estate was appropriated to charity, and the ordinary thought himself obliged so to apply it, upon the ground that there was a general principle of piety in the testator.\u201d\nIn the above case, Lord Eldon again says: In Clifford v. Francis, this doctrine is laid down: that when money is given to charity, without expressing what charity, there the king is the disposer of the charity; and a bill ought to be preferred in the attorney-general\u2019s name. I cite this (he says) to show that it contains a doctrine precisely the same as the Attorney-General v. Syderfin, and the Attorney-General v. Matthews. So those three eases (he say's) seemed to have established, in the year 1679, that the doctrine of this court was, that where the property was not vested in trustees, and the gift was to charity generally, not to be ascertained by the act of individuals referred to, the charity was to be disposed of, not by a scheme before the master, but by the king, the disposer of such charities in his character of parens patriae.\nSome late decisions in England, involving charities, evince a disposition rather to restrict than to enlarge the powers exercised on this subject. An arbitrary rule in regard to property, whether by a king or chancellor, or both, leads to uncertainty and injustice.\nIn a late case of Clark v. Taylor, 21 Eng. Law and Eq. 308, a gift, by will, to a particular charitable institution maintained voluntarily by private means, the particular intention having-ceased : held that the gift was not to be disposed of as a charitable gift cy pres, but failed and fell into the residue.\u201d\nIn'the case of the Baptist Association, Chief Justice Marshall says, there can be no doubt that the power of the crown .to superintend and enforce charities existed in very early times; and there is much \u201c difficulty in marking the extent of this branch of the royal prerogative before the statute. That it is a branch of prerogative, and not a part of the ordinary powers of the chancellor, is sufficiently certain,\u201d And in the case of the Attorney-General v. Flood, Hayne\u2019s Hep. 630, it is said: The court of chancery has always exercised jurisdiction in matters of charity, derived from the crown as parens patria.\u201d\nIn the provisions of the act of Pennsylvania defining the powers of a court of chancery, in 1836, it is declared, \u201c that in every case in which any court, as aforesaid, shall exercise any of the powers of a court of chancery, the same shall be exercised according to the practice in equity, prescribed or adopted by the supreme court of the United States.\u201d\nIn June, 1840, an act extended the jurisdiction of the supreme court within the city and county of Philadelphia, in chancery, in cases of \u201c fraud, accident, mistake, or account; \u201d and since then an act has been passed giving the orphans\u2019 court power where a vacancy exists in a trust to fill it, and also to dismiss trustees, executors, Ac., for abuse of their trusts, Ac. But no statutory provision is found embracing the case before us.\nThe chancery powers are of comparatively recent establishment in the State' of Pennsylvania, and it does not appear that the cypres power is given, and in the exercise of jurisdiction it seems to be disclaimed.\nIn King v. Rundle, 15 Barb. 139, \u201c there being a number of charitable bequests to several charitable bodies, the remainder was bequeathed or devised to the Protestant Episcopal society, for certain purposes, Ac.; the bequests to the. religious bodies were held invalid, and so of the remainder over, as not being statutory tests. In Yates v. Yates, 9 Barb. 324, the court say: \u201c We come to the conclusion that,' as a court of equity; we possess no original inherent jurisdiction, to enforce the execution of a charitable trust void in law, as contravening the statute against perpetuities, as. being authorized. In this case, where the use is a pious one, additional reasons might be urged against the exercise of such jurisdiction, were it important. Unless this trust will stand the statutory test to be applied to it, it must fall.\nIn the will of Sarah Zane, Mr. Justice Baldwin, sitting in Pennsylvania, and speaking of trustees, says: \u201c They will be considered as trustees, acting pinder the supervision of this court, as a court of chancery, with the same powers over trusts as courts of equity in England, and the courts of this State profess and exercise.\u201d \u201c When the fund shall be so ascertained a's to be capable of a final distribution, it will be directed to be applied exclusively to the objects designated in the will, as they existed at the time of her death, and shall continue until a final decree; if any shall then appear to have become extinct, the portion bequeathed to such object must fall into the residuary fund as a lapsed legacy. Its appointment to other purposes or cestuis que trust than those which can, by equitable construction, be brought within the intention of the will of the donor, is an exercise of that branch of the jurisdiction of the chancellor of England which has been conferred on this court by no law, and cannot be exercised, virtute officii, under our forms of government.\u201d\nAnd again, in Wright v. Linn, 9 Barr, 433, Bell, J., says: \u201c Though the statute of 43 Elizabeth, ch. 4, relating to charitable uses, has not, in terms, been recognized as extending to Pennsylvania, we have adopted, not only the principles that properly emanate from it,,but, with perhaps the single exception of cy pres, those which, by an exceedingly liberal construction, the English courts have engrafted upon it.\u201d\nIn the Methodist Church v. Remington, 1 Watts, 226, the court says : \u201c The original trust, though void; was not a superstitious one; nor if it were, would the property, as in England, revert to the State for the purpose of being appropriated in eadem genera, as no court here possesses the specific power necessary to give effect to the principle of cy pres, even were the principle itself not too grossly revolting to the public sense of justice to be tolerated in a country where there is no ecclesiastical establishment.\u201d\nIn Ray v. Adams, 3 Mylne and Keen\u2019s R. 237, it was held, \u201c that where a power is by will given to a trustee, which he neglects to execute, the execution of the trust devolves upon the- court; but if, in the events which happen, the intended trustee .dies before the time arrives for the ex\u00e9cution of the trust, and' the trust therefore fails, the testator is to be considered as. having so far died intestate.\nIn the case of Ommanney v. Butcher, 1 Turn. and Russ. R. 260, a testator concluded his will, \u201c in case there is any money remaining, I should wish it to be given in private charity.\u201d Held, \u201c if the testator meant to create a trust, and the trust is not effectually created, or fails, the next of kin must take.\u201d\nThere appears to be no law or usage in South Carolina that can materially affect the question under consideration. It seems to be conceded that if this charity cannot be administered by this court, in the State of Pennsylvania,''\u2022it cannot be made available by the laws of South Carolina.\nAfter the investigation we have been able to give to this important case, embracing the English chancery decisions on charities, as well as our own, and the cases decided in Pennsylvania, we are not satisfied that the fund in question ought to be withdrawn from those who are in possession of it, as the heirs of Frederick Kohne. There does not appear to us to be any safe and established principle, in Pennsylvania, which, under the circumstances, enables a court of chancery to administer the fund. It has not fallen back into the estate of the testator, because it was not separated from it. It remains unaffected by the bequest, because the means through which it was to be given and applied have failed. The decree of the circuit court is,\u2019therefore, affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice TANEY and Mr. Justice DANIEL concurred in the judgment of the court, but dissented from the reasoning. Their opinions were as follows."},{"case_name":"Wilson and Wife v. Miller, et als.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6728563\/","date":"1855-01-01","court":"Court of Appeals of Virginia","content":"TYLEvR, J.\nSuppose a father having advanced to A $50,000, gives him by will $20,000, and to B, $5,000. C, a posthumous child is born : A does not come in : What do you give C?\nRobertson. What he would have had if his father had died intestate. As to him the statute, as it were, throws the will in the fire. He would get one half the estate bequeathed \u2014 $12,500; towards making up which A and B should contribute propor-tionably out of their legacies, and the balance necessary to make up the *$12,500 would fall on and in this case absorb the residue of A\u2019s legacy\u2014 renounced in favor of C in like manner as A\u2019s entire share as parcener would have been absorbed, had his father died intestate, and he (A) had refused to bring in his advancement.\nOn the other hand it may happen, both where advancements are brought in, and where they are retained, that a surplus will remain to the advanced legatee, of his advancement or legacy or both after the portion of the posthumous child is satisfied: and it has been asked what is to be done with this surplus, of necessity it must belong or revert to the advanced legatee. The bringing in, or retaining the advancement can only affect the shares of the advanced legatee, and the posthumous child \u2014 \u25a0 no loss can accrue nor benefit be derived, to unadvanced legatees. They can have no claim to this surplus, because they will have received what the testator gave them, deducting their ratable contribution ascertained in conformity with the construction of the appellee\u2019s counsel \u2014 and the posthumous child having also received his full portion can have no right to any thing further.\nGreat stress has again been laid on the phrase \u201cfather\u2019s estate.\u201d The counsel for the appellees contends that this phrase embraces only what was the father\u2019s property at the time of his death. It is true, that property actually given by a father to his children can no longer in strictness be called his; still, practically, it may be considered as his when required to be brought in with a view to distribution: as a gift or loan on a condition annexed by law, that in a certain event, it shall revert, or be returned to be shared with the donor\u2019s other children, whether born or unborn at the time of his decease. In that event it is in effect added to the estate left, and the whole constitutes a mixed fund, which may well be called the father\u2019s estate, since it is by law to be divided among' all the children as though it were actually his, and it may be so called or considered as well as in a case of testacy under the act of *1785, as in one of intestacy. An estate devised, if we adhere to a literal construction, is no more a part of a, father\u2019s estate at the time of division or when the right of a posthumous child attaches, than estate previously given by way of advancement; and a strict construction therefore would lead to the absurdity of confirming a posthumous child to the father\u2019s estate when the father could have no estate at all.\nAgain, in this particular case, it is to be noted, that the advancements by the deed of 1787 were postponed in enjoyment until after the death of John Macon, the testator. During his life they were actually and literally a part of his estate, and so continued until the same moment when the residue of his estate vested in the devisees \u2014 -after his death. In strictness then the appellants have no better right, if the phrase be taken literally, to a share of the devised estate than of the advancements.\nBut in truth the appellants claim nothing, and can get nothing but a share-of the father\u2019s estate in the strictest sense of the word, unless the appellees voluntarily give them more. Should the appellees elect to retain their advancements it is absolutely certain that the appellants must be confined to the estate left by their father.\nIt is equally certain should the advancements be brought in, that the whole portion of Ann Wilson can be satisfied out of the estate left \u2014 unless the advancements greatly exceed the share which those having them would receive should they be brought in. It is not credible they will be guilty, of the folly of doing this. No such ease is likely ever to occur. None such was contemplated by the Legislature, or can be anticipated by the court.\nIn the same spirit the counsel on the other side has again endeavored to defend the chancellor\u2019s rigid construction of the provision of the act relating to the manner in which the share of a posthumous child is to be raised.\n*The chancellor reads the act as though it had expressly declared that the whole portion, should come out of the part devised and bequeathed, or as he again expresses it, be made up by the dev-isees &c. out of the parts so devised, &c. The counsel has fallen into the same error. The language of the act is \u201ctowards raising which portion,\u201d &c. If we must stick to the letter, we should have the words themselves and not translate -them into others which, as here, may have a very different import. Persons may contribute proportionablj7 towards raising a given sum without raising the entire sum required. That is precisely what is shown to be done by the devisees in the tabular statements presented to the court. They contribute towards raising the portion of the posthumous child. But these ratable contributions do not make up that portion where advancements have been made. There is a further amount to be made up, not by the devisees as such, but by the advanced child by reason of his advancements, and under the first clause of the 3d section, giving the posthumous child the benefit of the- law of intestacy. True, the additional sum may on the whole or in part come out of his devise; but he makes his election to-surrender it so far as is necessary to give-to the posthumous child his just and lawful portion ; and the law authorizing or requiring that election, it is not in the power of other parties or of the court to prevent or defeat it. The additional sum cannot properly be regarded as a contribution by the advanced legatee, beyond his proportion, according to the strict terms of the last branch of the 3d section, but where the election is made with a view to his own advantage, as a compensation imposed by the first branch of that section under the law of intestacy, which it adopts \u2014 as the condition on which he is allowed to keep his- advancements. On the improbable \u2014 not to say incredible supposition that the advanced child may bring in his advancements, when they exceed any share he can get by so doing, the additional sum given to the posthumous child is no-^contribution under the third section, but simply a donation \u2014 a free gift. If the Legislature had intended to provide for every case which could arise under the act of 1785, applying in regard to the posthumous children of testators the principle of hotchpot they could not well have used more definite and appropriate language.\nTo fortify his construction of the third section, the counsel for the appellees, resorts to an act passed more than half a century after. The act of 21st February, 1840, ch. 56, we are told is a legislative exposition of the act of 1785. If the very important question about which the judges of this court now differ, after full deliberation, had been fully discussed by the Legislature, their exposition, though then entitled to more weight, would still have been of no binding authority. But passing that, the argument is that the Legislature in 1840, must have construed the act of 1785, as it is construed by the counsel for the appellees, because they then declared, that the whole portion of a posthumous or pretermitted child of a testator, upon the death of such a child, under age, &c.\u00bb \u201cshall revert to the persons, to whom such estate may have been devised, by the will of such testator.\u201d It is very plain, we are told, that the Legislature must have regarded the portion of the posthumous child under the act of 1785, as coming- out of the devised estate, since it is made \u2014 -the whole of it \u2014 to revert to the devisees. Be it so: the statutory allowance is all the posthumous child can have, and that allowance must in all cases be made up by the devises out of the parts devised and bequeathed to them. How will the court under this legislative exposition dispose of a case of partial testacy, which has already been said to create an insuperable difficulty in the way of the appellants. Take the case in the 4th table. A father devises an estate of the value of S3,000, and leaves undisposed of property to the value of $9,000. He leaves two children to whom he devises the $3,000. A posthumous child is born. Now if this child is entitled to a share of the undis-posed estate, say $3,000, which all admit, *and also to one third of the devised estate, $1,000, how is this sum of $4,000 to be made up by the devisees, out of their devises, amounting in all to $3,000 only. How is this to be done in any case, where the estate as to which the testator is intestate, exceeds that disposed of by his will? and if that were possible, how is the posthumous child\u2019s portion, consisting in part of undevised estate, to revert to the devisees from whom it was not derived? One of two conclusions is inevitable, either the statute cannot be carried out according to the literal construction of the words relating to the manner of raising the share of a posthumous child ; or if that be attempted, such child in a case of partial testacy, (such as may often occur,) must be deprived of any share of the father\u2019s property not disposed of by the will.\nIt is no objection to our construction, to say that a posthumous child, not thought of by the father, may sometimes get more than children remembered in his will, that may equally happen under the opposite theory. It must happen wherever large legacies are given one or more children, and less than a just and equal share of the whole estate to others. And if it could not, it is no reason, because a parent, for sufficient cause, chooses to disinherit one child, known perhaps to deserve or to require nothing, that an unborn child should be cut off also With a shilling.\nNor is there any weight in the objection gravely urged, that an advanced child may have lost or expended his advancement, and should not therefore incur the hardship of being excluded from an equal participation in what his father might leave. Neither justice, nor the law of intestacy make any exception founded on the use or abuse by an advanced child, of his advancement. As to the hardship, that inflicted on the posthumous child, by excluding the principle of hotchpot, is no comparison greater than can arise to any other child, by applying it as proposed by the appellants. It is every way as just and beneficial in its operation under the third section, which adopts it in a *special case of testacy, as under the preceding sections which first gave it in cases of intestacy. A father gives away $90,000 to his first children, nine in number. One is born after his death unprovided for. All that is left, say $10,000 is devised to those who have already been advanced. What justice is there in any law or rule which would permit them to retain all that thejr had received, and take 9-10 of the pittance left? giving to them of the paternal property, each eleven thousand dollars, and to their helpless brother a hundredth part of what he would have had if the father had died intestate, and the advancements had been brought in, and a tenth of what he must have had if they had been retained. To put the injustice in a stronger light: let us suppose two persons die, similarly circumstanced except that one leaves a will, and the other none; the child of the intestate, under the chancellor\u2019s construction, must get more, it may be ten-fold or a hundred-fold more than that of the testator, under a law declaring that the portion of each shall be the same. What just father would desire this?\nOn the whole, under our construction, applying the doctrine of hotchpot, as the statute commands, it is made the interest of advanced devisees, in every case which c^n arise under the act of 1785, to bring in their advancements wherever it would be to their interest to do so in a case of intestacy. By rejecting that principle it is made their interest in every possible case to withhold them. Under the one construction, the share of the posthumous child must always be the same, which it would be if the father died intestate: the exact share the statute gives him, and which a just father would wish. Under the other, his portion must invariably be less, and this injustice is done to a helpless infant entitled to the favor and protection of the law and of the court, without adding one cent to the share of unadvanced children, and with the certain consequence of increasing that of those having already undue advantages.\n\u2019\u2018'THOMPSON, J.\nIt is very manifest, from the decree complained of, the petition praying an appeal, and the opinion given by the chancellor in refusing it, that the sole question decided in the court below, and intended,to be brought up by this appeal, was, as to the true construction of the statute in reference to posthumous and pretermitted children, (raised for the first time by the amended and supplemental bill,) claiming to participate in advancements, and that the question presented by the original bill as to the accountability of the widow, as devisee and legatee for life, to contribution as other legatees and devisees, is not before us; that part of the case never having been adjudicated, but retained and continued by consent of parties for future decision. If that question were now before me, I have no hesitation in saying, that as at present advised, the widow was not liable, if the devise was no more than a fair equivalent for her rights of dower and distribution in her husband\u2019s estate, in lieu of and as compensation for which it was expressly given by the will; for pro tanto at least, if not to the extent of the whole devise, even if it exceeded the legal claim, she must be regarded, not as a volunteer, but a purchaser of the highest dignity.\nA preliminar}' question, not affecting the merits of the decision, was started by the appellant\u2019s counsel rather in the form of a query or suggestion, than as a point assumed and insisted on in argument; that it was premature and irregular, and therefore erroneous, for the chancellor to take up and decide the case partially and by piece-meal, as he did by passing upon and dismissing the amended bill, leaving the original undisposed of. If there were any valid ground of objection to the proceeding, had it been done without or against the consent of parties, surely, that ground must be removed by the consent of parties given and entered of record. If the maxim consensus tollit errorem be applicable to any case, none can be conceived of to which it could be more pertinent than this. But, *in truth, the proceeding was neither premature nor irregular, and would have been strictly regular and in accordance with the usages and practice of courts of equity, without and against the consent of the plaintiffs. Where. the amended bill neither makes new parties, nor prays any additional measure of relief, than that sought by the original bill, but merely alleges new and additional matter of fact or law, in corroboration and support of the grounds of relief stated in the original bill, it would, no doubt, be not only premature and irregular, but erroneous, to pass upon a part of the case, on grounds of relief stated in an amended or supplemental bill irrespective of those alleged in the original. In such case the amendment should be considered as much part and parcel of the original bill as if originally inserted, and the two considered and disposed of together, at one and the same time, as if constituting but one bill or pleading. But when, as in the case before us, the amended bill claims an additional, distinct and different measure of relief from that asserted by the original, against new parties, upon new and distinct grounds, praying no further or other relief against the defendants in the original, by the amended bill, than that prayed by the original, what reason can be assigned why (and cui bono should) these two bills be regarded as so indissolubly blended and connected, as that the one may not be passed upon without the other? The questions presented by the two are not only different and distinct, but affect different parties. There was no necessity for further time to mature the cause for hearing upon the merits as to the amended bill, because all the facts were agreed by the pleadings, bill and answer, leaving only for decision a naked question of law arising upon or involved in the true construction of the act in relation to posthumous or pretermitted children. In such a case I am unable to perceive any reason why the defendant should not be permitted to meet the case and call for its decision in limine, as upon a demurrer, precisely as if it were an original bill standing alone *and unconnected with any other. I am aware of no authority or rule of practice forbidding it \u2014 cone has been brought to the attention of the court by counsel \u2014 and I take it for granted that none such exists; otherwise, it would have been found by the researches of the appellant\u2019s counsel and brought to the notice of the court.\nThe next, and, in truth, the only question in the cause discussed by the counsel, as if he deemed it at all interesting and important, and meriting the serious consideration of the court, is that briefly commented on by the chancellor in his opinion and decree dismissing the amended, bill, and the petition presented by the plaintiffs, to the chancellor, praying the allowance of an appeal from his decree; and that is the question raised by the amended bill claiming the right for the posthumous and pre-termitted child, to require the advancements to be brought in, and to participate therein according to the true construction of the act of 1785, which took effect in 1787, and which forms part of the 3d l of ch. 104, of the Code of 1819, page 376; which is incorporated, with slight variations, in the Code of 1849, ch. 122, \u00a7 18, p. 518; wherein provision is made for posthumous children, pretermitted by will and unprovided for, and which reads as follows in the Code of 1819, being a literal transcript of the act of 1785, the law in force at the death of this testator, and therefore determining the construction of his will:\n\u201cWhen a testator shall leave children born, and his wife enciente, the posthumous child, or children, if it be unprovided for by settlement, and be neither provided for nor disinherited, but only pretermitted by the last will, shall succeed to the same portion of the father\u2019s estate, as such child would have been entitled to if the father had died intestate \u2014 'towards raising which portion the devisees and legatees shall contribute proportionably out of the parts devised and bequeathed to them by the same will and testament.\u201d\n*This is a novel as well as an important and interesting question for the first time raised (so far as I am informed) by this case in the court below, and if raised before, in the inferior courts, certainly the first ever brought up for adjudication in the court of last resort.\nFor the appellants it is contended, that the posthumous child\u2019s portion, under this section, is not determined by or limited to the estate, of which the father died seized and possessed, or entitled to and disposed of by his last will, but it is insisted that the after born child has a right to claim participation in the advancements made to any of the legatees or devisees, in the lifetime of the father in the same way, and to the same extent, as if he had died wholly in testate, in fact. In support of this pretension of the after born child, it is urged that she is so entitled, because, under the statute of descents and distributions, if a father die intestate, all his children must bring in their advancements of whatever kind, if they would come into the partition and distribution, with the other children or par-ceners and distributees of the estate, of which the intestate died seized and possessed ; and if they elect not to come into hotchpot, they must be excluded from such partition and distribution; and that the statute having declared her entitled, in terms so plain and explicit as hardly to leave any room for construction, to the same portion of the estate, as if the father died intestate, it follows as a necessary consequence, that we must interpret the .Legislature as intending to confer upon the posthumous issue all the rights and privileges incident to an actual intestacy, and among them the right to call for the bringing in of advancements, in order to carry out the main design and paramount purpose of the Legislature, to make an equal provision for the pretermitted child: that the first member of the section declares the object and intent of the Legislature to make precisely the same provision for the posthumous child as in case of actual intestacy, and the last, the quo modo of raising that provision by ratable contributions on the devises and bequests given *by the will: that the mode prescribed for raising it does not limit it to an equal aliquot part of the estate left by the father at his death, nor forbid its augmentation by bringing advancements into hotchpot; and that there is, therefore, no necessary repugnancy or conflict between the first and last member of the section: that the apparent conflict and repugnancy, and the supposed difficulty of carrying out both prescriptions of the law might be reconciled or removed by assuming that the advanced legatee or devisee, must of necessity occupy one of three grounds: first, must have been so largely advanced as to be loser rather than gainer, by bringing the advancement into hotchpot, and therefore would not elect to come in, and that if he would be guilty of the folly and injustice of so electing, an act of folly and injustice not imputable in law, according to the argument, to any man, he would be denied the right to make such election; secondly, must have been so advanced and so provided for in the will as to make it one and the same thing to him, whether he came into partition and distribution or not, in which event he would elect to stay out, or if he came in, the result would not be varied; and thirdly, when the advancement was so much less than the legacy, as to make it to his advantage to come in, in which event he should be allowed so to elect, and take his legacy, reduced by his contributive share in favor of the posthumous child, estimated upon the principle of accounting for his advancements. It is said that by thus construing and executing the statute upon the principle of hotchpot, and the equitable election adverted to, we exclude the unadvanced legatee, and virtually the legatee just fully advanced and no more, and are enabled to dispose of the residue of the estate as equally, among the pretermitted child and the unadvanced and the short advanced legatees, as practicable, and as nearly approximating the general result contemplated by the act as possible. And finally, the counsel of the plaintiffs insists, if such irreconcilable conflict and repugnancy, which the other side impute *to his construction, should be found to exist, then the particular or secondary intent must yield to the general or primary one, and that the first part of the statute containing that general intent, must be carried into execution according to its literal or general terms, maugre the last part, and regardless of the consequences and difficulties it may involve.\nOn the other hand it is argued and insisted, that according to the plain meaning and obvious intent of the Legislature, to be deduced from a rational construction of the law, the posthumous child is entitled to only a full equal share or portion of the estate, of which the father died seized and possessed, or to which he was entitled, and had a right to dispose of by will, and that if he disposes of it all by will, the legatees and devisees i'n that will, must contribute in ratable proportions, to make up the portion or share of the after born child ; that the mode of raising the portions (if not expressly and conclusively,) very persuasively indicates the extent of that portion, and explains, restricts and limits the general words of reference used in the first member of the act, \u201cas if the father had died intestate,\u201d to mean nothing more than to say, that in the contingency of such a birth, the after born should succeed to an equal portion of the father\u2019s estate, meaning the estate that belonged to him at his death, and which he had a right to dispose of by will, and had so disposed of, and that it was not the intention of the Legislature by the use of these general words to apply to this case, the provision requiring advancements to be brought into hotchpot, found in the statute of descents and distributions, applicable from its very nature, reason and terms, to cases of actual absolute intestacy only, and not even applicable to cases of actual partial intestacy, until the adoption of the Code of 1849 \u2014 and the counsel on both sides have favored us with tabular statements and calculations to illustrate their respective views, and as showing the remote effects and consequences to which the opposite constructions would lead.\n*T7pon the first reading of the statute, the chancellor\u2019s construction of it, which is the one insisted on by the ap-pellee\u2019s counsel, seemed to me to be the plain and obvious one, and the more I have examined and canvassed it, its consistency and accordance with the reason and spirit, and even the letter of the law, has become but the more apparent to my understand ing. If it be possible to allow the after born child to call for advancements, without producing irreconcilable \u2019conflict and repugnancy between the two members of the section, and disregarding that which levies the portion of the after born child upon the devises and legacies in the will, it must be conceded on all hands, that these advancements, if brought in at all, are only to be so brought in and accounted for quoad the pretermitted child, and not for the benefit of all as in case of actual intestacy; and if so, I cannot conceive of a case of bringing ' in advancements, whether large or small, much or little, that will not, whilst it enures to the benefit of the after born child by augmenting its portion, at the same time operate to the injury of the un-advanced legatees, or those just equally or fully advanced; nor can I conceive of a case where an advanced legatee, no matter how largely advanced, would not gain by coming in with his advancements, to the detriment of the unadvanced legatees; and there seems to me to be as little warrant in the statute for denying any the right of bringing in their advancements, if they so elect, (as has been said might be done,) and of sequestrating their legacies for the use and benefit of the other children, as \u2018for requiring any to bring them in, in defiance of the plain language of the law; that all the legatees or legacies (saying nothing about advancements) should contribute rata-bly,' to raise or make up the portion of the pretermitted child.\nThe cqnstruction given to the law by the chancellor, and which to me appears the plain and obvious one, is attended with none of these difficulties, and inconvenient if not absurd consequences. It gives a sensible meaning to and reconciles all parts of the statute with each *other, and avoids all the seeming conflict and repugnancy, by limiting and restraining the sense and effect of general words in one clause, by the specific and directory provisions in another. We have been taught by the legal commentators and sages of the law, that there are three points to be considered in the construction of remedial statutes \u2014 the old law, the mischief, and the remedy \u2014 and, moreover, that when the words of a law are dubious or uncertain, the most universal and effectual way of discovering the true-meaning is, by considering the reason and spirit of the rule. If we follow these guides, and employ these tests of construction, it seems to me, that no other conclusion is possible than that to which the chancellor arrived in\u2019his brief but cogent and unanswerable opinion copied on the record. What then was the state of the law when the act of 1785 was passed? By it a- plenary testamentary power was given to every person deemed capable of exercising it, and when exercised according to the prescribed forms and solemnities of the law, no matter how capriciously or unjustly, no matter who were the objects of testamentary bounty, the act was valid \u2014 voluntas stat pro lege\u2014 but if any one chose not to exercise this testamentary power, and to die intestate, the law stepped in, and by the statute of descents and distributions disposed of his estate, real and personal; and in doing so, it adopted as its rule and guide the principle of equality.\nTo produce this equality there was incorporated in the statute the provision requiring advancements to be brought in, called the doctrine of hotchpot, borrowed from the English statute of distributions, which that statute had borrowed from the common law of descents, applicable originally in England only to lands given in frank marriage; a species of entail which were required to be brought in when lands descended in fee to parceners (who at common law were only females) before the donee in frank marriage could come into partition with her sisters. Until the Revisal of 1819, land and personalty were kept so wholly separate and *distinct, that a parcener was not bound to bring land into hotchpot to entitle him to claim his distributive share, nor a distributee to bring in an advancement of personalty, to entitle him to come in for an equal share in the partition of lands descended. By the Code of 1819 the two subjects were blended, and both lands and personalty required to be brought in, to entitle a child or descendant of an intestate to come into partition or distribution. We have seen, that as the law stood in 1785', it recognized the testamentary power in its most plenary extent, in every one deemed capable of exercising it, and where any one failed to exercise it, disposed of his estate according to the principles of equality, which we find incorporated in the statute of distributions -among- which is the prescription that those advanced in the lifetime, must bring in or account for their advancements, as a condition precedent to their right to come into distribution and partition.\nBut then there was found to exist a manifest defect, if not a casus omissus in the statute of wills, in failing to provide for the case of an after born pretermitted child, for whom no provision or settlement was made by a will made in favor of the children in esse at its date, or the death of the testator', as well as the case of a man dying leaving no children born, but his wife en-ciente, and leaving a will making po provision for the posthumous child. How did the statute remedy the mischief incident to the last case? Proceeding upon the hypothesis that the will was made in ignorance of a state of facts, which, had they been known to the testator, and supposing him possessed of the ordinary natural affections, would have prevented its execution, or have caused the execution of one in favor of the posthumous child, the statute wholly abrogates the will unless the child die unmarried or under twenty-one years of age. The will is allowed to have no effect during the life of the after born child, but if he should neither marry nor attain the age of twenty-one years, full effect is given to the will. Here the statute, ^placing itself in loco parentis, and exercising a provident forecast, and making provision for contingencies not contemplated by the natural parent, has only done what it is most natural to presume he would have done, had he foreseen the event \u2014 the birth of a posthumous child \u2014 and in so doing has applied a remedy exactly commensurate with the mischief; nothing more, nothing less. What remedy has the statute provided for the mischief in the case under consideration? Not by abrogating the will and creating an intestacy, (as they would have done, if they meant to adopt equality as their rule, as in case of actual intestacy in dealing with the mischief,) but by recognizing and permitting the will to stand, and providing that the pretermitted child shall he recompensed, by having such portion made up to him or her in ratable contributions by the legatees and devisees in the will, as he or she would have succeeded to, if the father had died intestate; meaning, as I interpret it, an equal portion of the estate of which the father died, seized and possessed, or to which he was entitled. Here, again, as in the case first mentioned, the Legislature interferes no farther with the will than to modify it, and make it conform to the presumed intent of the testator in the contingency, unforeseen to him, that has happened; and as it was impossible for the law-giver to speculate as to what provision the testator would have made, whether equal or unequal with those provided for in the will, from convenience, if not absolute necessity, the rule of equity was adopted, no matter how far it may have been departed from in the will made in favor of the children in esse, when made.\nI think it cannot be seriously gainsayed or questioned, that the doctrine of advancements was inapplicable to a case of partial intestacy before made so by the Code of 1849, although all must admit, the words of the statute are just as general and sufficient, if not more so, to make it applicable to that case than the words of this law are to make it applicable to this; and ^whilst the counsel for the appellants assumes in his argument that this must be regarded as a case of partial intestacy, not in relation to the estate in the case first supposed, but in relation to the person, yet he has failed to assign any good reason why it should be any more applicable to a constructive partial intestacy as to the person, created by the law, than to an actual partial intestacy as to the estate, created by the failure of the testator to place it under the operation of the will. If properly held inapplicable to the first, I should say a fortiori is it so as to the last? I inquired of the counsel, upon his construction of the law, how he would dispose of a case combining the three features of a will, partial intestacy in fact as to a part of the estate, and the birth of a pretermitted and posthumous child; and I understood him as admitting, that it enhanced the difficulty of carrying out his construction to its results and consequences, but I did not exactly understand his scheme for overcoming the difficulty.\nNow, upon my construction, there is not the least difficulty as to the property undis-posed of by the will \u2014 that is distributable under the general statute of distributions without the doctrine of hotchpot being applied \u2014 because it is a case of partial intestacy, and the posthumous child is entitled to her share as an after born distribu-tee, not under the section of the statute of wills we are now considering, but under the statute of distributions; and it is divisible equally irrespective of advancements in the life-time, or legacies and bequests in the will, or the provision made for the after born by the statute. If this be so, does it not add confirmation, if not demonstration, to the conclusion, that the object of the law was only to make the after born an equal participant in the estate, of which the father died, seized and possessed, or entitled to and disposed of by the will; for, as to that which he failed to dispose of, and as to which he died intestate, there was no necessity for any legislation, the after born being entitled to her equal share under the statute of distributions; and if *in claiming her distributive share as to this, she could not call for the application of the doctrine of hotchpot, why should she be allowed to do so, in reference to the share or portion given her by the act, in the estate disposed of by the will? I should say, if the right to claim advancements in the first case \u2014 that of making distribution of so much of the estate as was undisposed of by the will \u2014 does not exist, a fortiori does it not, as to that disposed of by the will?\nIt seems to me to be a legal solecism, to hold that the doctrine of hotchpot applies to a case like the present. By the very terms of the statute, it is only applicable between parceners and distributees, and its whole sole and exclusive purpose is, to produce equality among all the parceners and distributees. Here are no parceners, no distributees. On the one hand is the posthumous child, whom' the appellants\u2019 counsel terms a constructive parcener or distributee; on the other, only legatees and devisees. So far from all being made to come in and rendered equal, it is only to be.applied as between the advanced legatee and the posthumous child; and so far from conducing to equality producing greater inequality. The law says the portion is to be raised by ratable contributions out of the legacies and bequests. The counsel for the appellants says, or in effect says, it is to be raised by contributions from legacies, bequests and advancements made in the life-time \u2014 nay, more, not only are the legacies and devises of the over advanced or just fully advanced legatees, sequestered for the benefit of the posthumous and un-advanced legatees; but if they would elect upon the principle of hotchpot, to come in and bring with them their advancements, as they would have the right to do, however great the folly and injustice of the act, they are to be denied that right, because it would enure to the benefit of the after born, by augmenting her share, and throw an additional burden upon the unadvanced legatee.\nIn view, then, of the old law, the mischief to be provided against, and this law enacted as the remedy; *in view of the fact that the will is not abrogated, but suffered to stand, and no intestacy, in fact created for the application of the doctrine of hotchpot \u2014 all the inequalities of the will, as between the original devisees and legatees, permitted to remain, and not one word said about advancements in the section; in view of what I regard as an undeniable proposition of law, that the principle of hotchpot was never applicable to a total testacy, or even partial intestacy, until the Code of 1849, (although by the letter of the statute of descents and distributions, its applicability might be urged with as much or more plausibility than to this case,) in view of the provision of the section requiring the portion to be raised or made up by the ratable contributions from the bequests and devises in the will, but saying nothing about advancements; can it be that we. are tied down to the letter of the first part of the section, and by the letter bound to interpret the Legislature as intending, by the use of the general terms employed, \u201cas if the father had died intestate,\u201d to place the posthumous issue upon higher ground than the children of whose existence he was cognizant, and for whom he made provision by his will, to give her more than an equal part of the estate of which he died possessed, or was entitled to at his death, by giving her a right to participate in advancements \u2014 a right denied to the living children and unadvanced legatees and devisees, although these devises and bequests were to be diminished by contribution and abatement in favor of the posthumous child?\nIn my opinion, we cannot so hold without disregarding the reason and spirit of the law, and without doing even more violence to its letter, taking the whole sec-' tion together, than is done by the construction contended for by the appellees; and without encountering effects and consequences most inconvenient and unjust, if not too preposterous and absurd to result from a legitimate construction of the law. With all due deference and respect for the opinions of *those who differ with me, I think the plain and obvious intent, and meaning of the statute, was to limit and confine the posthumous and pretermitted child to an equal portion of the estate to which the father was .entitled at his death, if disposed of by will, to be raised by ratable contributions from the bequests and devises according to the section of the statute of wills under consideration ; and as to so much as was not willed she was entitled to her equal share, irrespective of advancements or legacies under the statute of distributions. And I think the mistake of those who maintain a different opinion, has arisen from their giving to the general terms used in the first part of the section, \u201cas if the father had died intestate,\u201d (terms, in my view, employed by the Legislature only to indicate an intention to give an equal pa.rt of what the father was seized and possessed and disposed of by his will,) the same meaning and the same effect they would bear and have in case of an actual absolute intestacy; whereas, in this case there is no actual intestacy, or intestacy in fact, either, partial or total, but, on the contrary, a total testacy and its existence recognized by the law itself, and provision made upon the hypothesis of its continuing validity, by requiring the legatees and devisees to raise the portion of the after born by ratable contributions out of their several bequests. These are my reasons for concurring in opinion with the chancellor and for affirming his decree."},{"case_name":"Owens and others against The Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/496052\/","date":"1856-01-01","court":"New York Court of Appeals","content":"Selden, J.\nThe surrogate found in this case that thq voluntary association, now represented by the appellants, was the legatee to whom the bequest in the will of Owens was intended to be made; and the supreme court appears to have arrived at the same conclusion. The only question before this court, therefore, is, whether a bequest to such an association is valid. This question is not affected by the incorporation of the missionary society after the making of the-will, and after the death of the testator. (Baptist Association v. Hart's Executors, 4 Wheat., 1; Same v. Smith & Robertson, 3 Peters, in Appendix, 481; Trustees of Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 99.) In view of these authorities it is clear that, for all the purposes of this case, the question is precisely the same as if the appellants had remained unincorporated to the present time ; and so it seems to have been regarded by the counsel as well as by the court below.\nIf the bequest to the association while unincorporated was valid, there can, I apprehend, be no doubt of the right of the appellants to the legacy. The corporation is simply the association incorporated. The name is the same, and it is to be inferred from the case that the original associates are the corporators. It is the same body, and possesses all its original rights, together with such rights and powers in addition as are conferred by its charter.\nFor the appellants, two points are made which are directly in conflict. It is insisted : First. That the bequest t.o the missionary society is absolute, and not qualified or limited by any trust whatever; and Secondly. That it is valid as a charity. These two positions are inconsistent, and cannot stand together. Nothing is a charity, in a legal sense, except that which is limited to some charitable use. But if this bequest is unaccompanied by any trust, the fund might be appropriated by the association to the establishment of a gaming-house, or any other immoral purpose; or it might Jr e distributed among and be pocketed by the members. An absolute gift or bequest to an unincorporated missionary society is no more \u201c a charity \u201d than an absolute gift to an individual. In legal contemplation, \u201ccharity,\u201d and \u201c charitable use,\u201d are convertible terms; and there can be no charitable- use without a trust. To deny that this bequest was accompanied by a trust, therefore, is to deny that the law of charitable uses applies to the case; and this, of course, is to deny the validity of the bequest. Nothing is better settled than that a devise or bequest to an unincorporated association is, in general, void, as well in equity as at law. (Co. Litt., 95, a; Shep. Touch., 235; Jackson v. Corey, 8 John., 385; Hornbeck v. Westbrook, 9 id., 73; Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat., 1; Green v.-- 6 Conn., 293.) It is only by virtue of that peculiar jurisdiction exercised by courts of equity, in regard to charitable uses, that such bequests have ever-been sustained.\nTo uphold this bequest, therefore, it is indipensable to maintain that the missionary society, if successful in obtaining the fund in question, would be bound to appropriate it to some pious or charitable use. If, then, a bequest, unaccompanied by any designation of the purposes to which it is to be applied, be made to a society whose name and public acts indicate that its objects are religious nr charitable, is there an implied trust which limits the use to such objects? Where the bequest is to a corporation there would seem to be some basis for such an implication, Decause the objects, purposes and powers of the corporation being in all cases more' or less clearly defined by its charter, the bequest may fairly be presumed to have been intended for those specific objects. But we have no such criterion for ascertaining the nature and purposes of a voluntary association. Those purposes may change with the will of the associates. They may be pious to-day and impious to-morrow. There is no law to prevent or restrain such changes. It is difficult to see, therefore, how a bequest to such an association can be deemed to create a \u201c charitable use,\u201d unless the purpose to which it is to be devoted is pointed out by the testator.\nIt has nevertheless been held, in several cases, that a mere naked bequest to an unincorporated association is valid as a charity. In Hornbeck's Executors v. American Bible Society (2 Sandf. Ch. R., 133), a legacy, absolute in terms, to the New-York State Colonization Society, a mere voluntary association, was held valid by Assistant Vice-Chancellor Sandford, under the law of charitable uses ; and in the case of Banks v. Phelan (4 Barb., 80), a legacy to the Roman Catholic Church of Petersburg was sustained by the late Justice Edwards upon similar grounds, although the church was not incorporated, and although there was not a word in the will indicative of the use to which the fund should be applied. So in the case of Executors of Burr v. Smith (7 Verm., 241), the Supreme Court of Vermont, after a very elaborate argument and investigation, held legacies valid as charities which were given to the treasurers of the American Bible Society, the American Colonization Society and the American Home Missionary Society respectively, the societies being unincorporated. The legacies were given in each case, as expressed in the will, \u201c for the use and purposes of the society,\u201d and there was no other express limitation of the uses to which the fund was to be applied.\n. In these eases the- courts must have proceeded upon the ground that it was to be presumed that the testatoi intended the legacy to be used to promote the objects indicated by the names of the societies. In no other way could these bequests have been regarded as \u201c charities,\u201d it being essential to a legal charity that there be a use and a trust. Without intending to express any opinion as to the correctness of these cases in this respect, I shall, nevertheless, assume, for the purposes of this case, that when a bequest is made to an unincorporated society, whose general objects are known to be, as its name indicates, religious or charitable, a trust is implied that the fund shall be devoted to those objects. With this assumption can the bequest in this case be supported as a charity ?\nThis question opens up an inquiry which is surrounded with difficulty. The law of charitable uses, as it has existed in England, may be ascertained with reasonable certainty; but how far that law prevails in this state, and' to what extent our courts have succeeded to the powers \u2022exercised in the English courts of equity on the subject, depends upon considerations which are necessarily obscure.\nThe jurisdiction of the court of chancery in England in relation to charities was derived from three sources : First. From its ordinary jurisdiction over trusts; Second. From the prerogative of the crown; Third. From the statute of 43 Elizabeth, ch. 4. It has never been seriously contended that the courts of this state possessed that portion of the jurisdiction which was derived from the statute of Elizabeth. This statute was embraced in the general repeal of English statutes in 1788, and there is not the slightest evidence that it had previously been adopted so as to become a part of the common law of the state. It is clear, therefore, that so far as the law of charitable uses was derived from and dependent upon the statute of 43 Elizabeth, it is not in force here, and it seems equally clear that our courts arc not endowed with any portion of the power which the char> cellor of England exercises by virtue of the royal prerogative, and as the personal representative of the crown. It follows that the jurisdiction possessed by the courts of this state over trusts for charitable purposes is limited to that which the court of chancery in England possessed independent of those two sources. This is the view which seems to have been taken of the subject by this court in the case of Williams v. Williams (4 Seld., 525).\nWere it possible, then, to analyze at this day the juris \u2022 diction of the English- courts, and to ascertain the exact proportion of its separate parts, all doubts in regard to the jurisdiction of our own courts would be resolved. But the blending of \u2022 the powers derived from these various sources in the same court, and their consequent indiscriminate exercise, has rendered this a difficult task. I think, however, that a careful attention to the \u2022 history of the jurisdiction, and especially that part of it which is based upon the statute of Elizabeth, will enable us to determine with some degree of precision the relative importance of its different branches.\nTo comprehend this history fully it will be necessary to recur to the origin of uses, and to some of the statutory enactments bearing upon them, \u201c charitable uses \u201d being-the legitimate offspring of these enactments. The first invention by which the ecclesiastics of England sought to evade the statutes of\u2019mortnrain, viz., common recoveries, having been defeated by the statute of Westminster 2, 13 Edward I., ch. 22, which provided that, notwithstanding the defendant made default, it should still \u201cbe inquired of by the country whether the demandant had right,\u201d the next device was that of uses. As lands could not be conveyed directly to the ecclesiastical bodies themselves, they were procured to be conveyed to others to the use of such bodies, and by the aid of the court of chancery, which held the feoffees bound to execute such uses, the object of the ecclesiastics was accomplished. An attempt was made to meet this new device by the statute of 15 Richard II., ch. 5. But as this statute was only aimed at corporations and such bodies as had perpetual succession, there were many uses of a superstitious nature which were not within its provisions. It was not, therefore, until the statute of 23 Henry VIII., ch. 10, that this new invention of the clergy met with its final overthrow. That statute provided that all uses, &c., to the use of churches, chapels, church wardens, guilds, companies or brotherhoods, made of devotion, or by assent of the people, without any corporation, and also to the intents to have any continual service of a priest for threescore years, or other like uses, should be void.\nThe broad and comprehensive terms of this statute evince the hostility which uses, perverted as they had generally been to superstitious purposes, had excited. Its sweeping \u2022phraseology served not only to suppress all superstitious uses, but subverted many which were meritorious. It soon came to be seen that all uses were not superstitious. Accordingly, the statute of 1 Edward VI., ch. 14, called the statute of chauntries, speaks in the preamble of \u201c good and godly uses, as in erecting of grammar schools to the education of youth in virtue and godliness, the further augmenting of the universities, and better provision for the poor and needy.\u201d\nThe term \u201c charitable,\u201d as descriptive of a particular class of uses, appears to have had its origin subsequent to the latter act, and was used, in contradistinction to superstitious, to designate such good and worthy uses as were deemed not to be within the purview of the statute of Henry VIII. There is no evidence that this term was applied to such uses to distinguish them legally as a class until after the statute of 1 Edward VI. Indeed, there is strong evidence that it was not; otherwise it would certainly have been resorted to in the preamble to that act, instead of the far less appropriate phrase \u201c good and godly.\u201d This preamble, was clearly the germ of the law of charitable uses, not that such uses did not exist before, but they had never been grouped together as a distinct class, and no peculiar principles had been applied to them. The words \u201c other like uses,\u201d in the statute of 23 Henry VIII, ch. 10 naturally gave rise to this classification. They were suggestive of a class of uses not \u201clike\u201d those intended to be condemned, and the statute of 1 Edward VI. was the first attempt at a description of this class. From the date of this statute, if not before, it was strenuously maintained that the statute of 23 Henry VIII. was aimed solely at superstitious uses and that the uses mentioned in the preamble to the statute of 1 Edward VI. were examples of an extensive class of exceptions. The term \u201c charitable \u201d soon came to be used as descriptive of this class. There appears, however, to be no reported case in which this doctrine was distinctly confirmed by the courts, prior to Porter's case (1 Coke, 16, a). This case deserves careful consideration, as throwing much light upon the law of charitable uses. It will be found to harmonize with and to be strikingly confirmatory of the view I have taken of the origin of such uses as a class.\nThe case was this: Nicholas Gibson, of London, had devised, in the reign of Henry VIII., all his lands and tenements to his wife, upon condition that she should, immediately upon his decease, by the advice of learned counsel, give, grant and assure the same for the maintenance of a free school, and certain alms-men and alms-women forever. The widow, instead of executing the trust, made a lease for forty years, and the defendant, Porter, was in possession under this lease. The heir entered for breach of the condition and then conveyed to the queen, whereupon the attorney-general filed an information in the court of exchequer in behalf of the queen to recover possession. The case was argued by Sir Thomas Egerton, afterwards Lord Ellesmere, and by Sir Edward Coke for the queen. The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted that the condition was void under the statute of 23 Henry VIII, ch. 10, for the follow ing, among other reasons: Because \u201c the statute saith \u2018 such uses, and all other like uses, intents, ijc.,\u2019 shall be void.\u201d To which the counsel for the queen replied, that the case was not within the intent of the act of 23 Henry VIII., \u201cbecause it was not the intention of the said act to extend to such good and charitable uses as the uses in our case are;\u201d and again, after referring to various, other statutes made to suppress certain superstitious uses, they say: \u201c But by none of these 'acts good and charitable (as the uses in our case), are taken away, abolished or made void, but rather by the 'act of 1 Edward VI. they are intended to be maintained, as appearetli by the preamble thereof, viz.,\n\u2018 For the education of youth in virtue and piety at grammar schools, for the further augmentation of the universities and the better provision of the poor and needy,\u2019 which, by the said act of 1 Edward VI., are called good and godly uses; and therefore it shall not be intended that such good and godly uses were made void by the statute of 23 Henry VIII.\u201d The court held \u201c that the statute of 23 Henry VIII. did not extend to take away the good and charitable uses in the case at bar,\u201d and gave judgment for the queen. Lord Coke adds: \u201cAnd the same day judgment was given in the King\u2019s Bench, in the like case upon the said statute of 23 Henry VIII.\u201d This case shows that the term \u201c charitable\u201d was used at this time to designate a class of uses excepted from that statute. It will be seen, too, that the learned counsel for the queen base their argument for the exception, not upon any classification of uses as charitable prior to the statute of Henry VIII, but upon the inference to be drawn from the preamble to the statute of 1 Edward VI, ch. 14; and also that they argue it as an original question, and do. not even allude to any judicial authority for their position.\nIt would be difficult, I think, to maintain, in the face of \u25a0 such an argument from two such men as Egerton and Coke, that the law of charitable uses, as it afterwards existed, had obtained at that time any substantial foothold in the law of England. But this is not all. The reference by Coke, in the conclusion of his report of Porter's case, to a judgment of the court of king\u2019s bench, pronounced on \u201c the same day,\u201d and in \u201c the like case,\u201d is very significant. The case referred to by Coke is that of Martindale v. Martin (Cro. Eliz., 288), more fully reported by Popham under the name of Gibbons v. Maltyard & Martin (Poph. R., 6). There, Sir Richard Fulmerston had devised certain lands to his executors, in trust, to be appropriated to the permanent maintenance of a preacher \u201c to preach the word of God in the church of St. Mary, in Thetford, four times in the year, and to have for his labor ten shillings for every sermon,\u201d and to the establishment of a free school. The executors neglected the trust, and the heir entered for condition broken, whereupon the lessee of the executors brought ejectment. The first point taken by the defendants was, that the use was made void by the statute of 23 Henry VIII., ch. 10. As to this, Popham says: \u201c But it was, after often argument, agreed by all the court that the first exception was to no purpose, for they conceived that this statute was to be taken to extend only to the uses which tend to super stition,\u201d &c. Now the fact that the judgment of the king\u2019s bench in this, and of the exchequer in Porter's case, were rendered on the same day, and that, too, after repeated argument in the king\u2019s bench raises a probability 'that the decision was the result of an interchange of views between the courts; and this probability is increased by the circumstance that Sir John Popham, who was chief justice of the king\u2019s bench at the time the decision was made, was attorney-general when Porter's case was'commenced, and himself filed the information in that case.\nWe have here, then, a combination of the most eminent legal'talent in England, including the justices of the king\u2019s bench, the barons of the exchequer, the attorney and solicitor-general, repeatedly arguing and gravely considering whether there was at that time any such thing as a valid charitable use in England, except those enumerated in the preamble to the statute of 1 Edward VI., ch. 14. It was held that there was, and what was the ground ? Not that charitable uses were known and recognized as a distinct class, prior to the statute of 23 Henry VIII. t but, as stated by Popham, it was that at the time of that statute \u201c they began to have respect to the ruin of the authority of the pope,\u201d &c. This also is the argument used in Porter\u2019s case\u201e The queen\u2019s counsel, speaking of the statute of Henry VIII., then say: \u201c Distinguenda sunt t\u00e9mpora, and the time when this was made is to be considered. * * * Before that time divers superstitions and errors in the Christian religion, which had a pretence and semblance of charity and devotion, were discovered by the light of God\u2019s word; therefore, to take away such superstitious uses, as to pray for souls supposed to be in purgatory, and the like, that statute was made, and not to prohibit the erecting of grammar schools, and relief for poor men.\u201d\nIt is not claimed that these cases prove that there was no such thing as charity in England, previous to the statute of 23 Henry VIII, nor that there were no uses created for charitable purposes, which were upheld and sustained by the courts. But they do prove that such uses had not, prior to that statute, been grouped together as a distinct class, and made the subject of a separate and peculiar jurisdiction. It is clear that this statute gave rise to that grouping, by first rendering it necessary to distinguish between such uses and those which were superstitious. The question to be determined is not, when did charity begin in England, but, what was the origin of that peculiar code administered by the court of chancery under the name of \u201c the law of charitable uses,\u201d and I maintain that the two cases here referred to conclusively show that there were no traces of that code in the law at that time.\nBut we have not yet exhausted the light shed by Porter\u2019s case upon this obscure subject. Lord Loughborough, speak ing of this case in Attorney-General v. Bowyer (3 Ves., 714) says: \u201cPorter\u2019s case was upon a devise before the statute of wills, and consequently before the statute 43 Elizabeth. It does not appear that this court, at that period, had cognizance, upoii information, for the establishment of charities. Prior to the time of Lord Ellesmere, as far as the tradition in times immediately following goes, there were no such informations as this upon which I am now sitting, but they made out the case as well as they could at law.\u201d Porter's case itself affords strong circumstantial evidence of the truth of this remark. That was an instance of a charitable use of the most favored kind, as the law was afterwards understood; and what was the course pursued by the most eminent counsel in England to enforce it? The first step taken was an entry by the heir for condition broken; the next, a conveyance by the heir to the queen; and the third, an information by the attorney-general, not in the court of chancery to establish the use, but in the court of exchequer to recover possession. That all this was done by the advice of Sir John Popham, who was then attorney-general, is evident, because the entry by the heir was on the twenty-fourth of January, the conveyance to the queen on the twenty-fifth, and the filing of the information on the third of February, six days afterwards; and that the object of the whole was to secure the execution of the trust is proved by the subsequent argument in the case. Would Sir John Popham, attorney-general, and one of the ablest lawyers in England, have resorted to this indirect and circuitous mode of establishing the use, if he had supposed it could be done by a direct proceeding in chancery? The information in the exchequer was a proceeding at law in the nature of an ejectment.\nThe course pursued in this case, as well as that upon the will of Sir Richard Fulmerston, go strongly and almost conclusively to show that informations in chancery by the artorney-general in such cases were not then known; and this is still further confirmed by the result of the researches of the record commissioners of England, who, as I understand their report, did not discover a single instance of the filing of such information prior to the time of which we are speaking.\nThere is still another case with which Lord Ellesmere was connected, and which, as it possesses some extraordinary features, is worthy of notice here. It is not found in any volume of reports, but is elaborately reported in the preamble to the statute of 4 James I., ch. 7. Hugh Westwood, of Chedworth, in the county of Gloucester, had devised certain premises, consisting of a rectory, parsonage, advowson, &c., to Lord Charedes and a number of other devisees, in trust, to found and maintain a free grammar school in the town of Northleech, giving the nomination of the schoolmaster to the heirs of the devisor, and the determination of all doubts that might arise upon the will to the justices of assize. The inhabitants of Northleech, pursuant to the will, bought a house and lot for the school and employed a schoolmaster\"; but, the devisees having all died except one, the survivor, Thomas Apparye, conveyed the premises to his sons in fraud of the trust; and the heir of Westwood also entered, claiming that the trust was void. The inhabitants and the schoolmaster then jointly filed a bill in chancery, and the lord chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton, referred the case to the justices of assize, pursuant to the will, who reported that the school should be incorporated, and the premises then conveyed to the schoolmaster and his successors, and an order was made by the chancellor in accordance with this report. Afterwards, a decree to the same eifect was obtained from Sir John Pickering, lord keeper of the great seal, and still later this decree was confirmed by Sir Thomas Egerton who succeeded Sir John as lord keeper. The statute of James incorporates the school by the name of \u2018 The schoolmaster and usher of the free grammar school of Hugh Westvvood, Esq., of the town of Northleech,\u201d and provides that the corporation \u201cshall have, hold and enjoy the premises, the statute of mortmain or any other law or statute to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.\u201d It also provides for the payment to William Westwood, the heir of the devisor, of one hundred and sixty pounds for the surrender of his rights in the premises; and for an annuity of thirty pounds a year for life to Eustace Apparye, \u201cin consideration of his yielding up of his said lease and conveyance of the said parsonage and premises.\u201d\nThere could be no stronger proof that the peculiar law of charitable uses, as afterwards understood, was at that time unknown in England, than is afforded by this case. If that law had prevailed, the remedy would have been simple. An information in chancery, in the name of the attorney-general, ^vould speedily have forced the devisees or their heirs to found the grammar school pursuant to the will. Instead of this, a somewhat incongruous suit is commenced in the joint names of the inhabitants of Northleech and the schoolmaster; and although the lord chancellor made a decree in the case, which for some reason it was found necessary to have confirmed, first by Lord Keeper Sir John Pickering, and afterwards by Sir Thomas Egerton, who became lord keeper in 1596 (39 Elizabeth), yet the powers of all these high officers combined seem not to have been successful in establishing this grammar school until 1606, ten years afterwards; and then only by first compromising with all the claimants, and then procuring an incorporation in the names of the schoolmaster and usher, and vesting the title in them by direct act of parliament. Precisely what the obstacle was which prevented for so long a time the establishment of this use, does not appear. It may have been the want of a proper party to prosecute the suit; that is, to represent the only real beneficiary, the public.\nThese three cases, viz., Porter\u2019s case, that upon the will of Sir Richard Fulmerston, and that of the Free Grammar School of Northleech, all occurring at the same precise period. seem to have roused the attention of the English people, and to have stimulated to a rapid growth the law of charitable uses; the seeds of which, planted in the statute of 23 Henry VIII., had already taken root in that of 1 Edward VI., ch. 14. Informations in the name of the attorney-general, and the statutes of 39 and 43 Elizabeth, were the first indications of this growth.\nPassing over the statute of 39 Elizabeth, which it is unnecessary particularly to notice, I come to that of 43 Elizabeth, which has given rise to so much conflict of opinion both in England and in this country, one class of jurists tracing the law of \u201c charitable uses\u201d mainly to this statute, and the other insisting that it was merely designed to provide a new mode of enforcing such uses, but added nothing to the power of the court over them.\nTo appreciate fully the motives which led to the passage of this act, as well as to the proceeding by information in the name of the attorney-general, it is necessary to notice one or two distinctions not yet particularly adverted to. In the first place, we must distinguish charity in a legal sense from acts of mere liberality or benevolence, To constitute a \u201c charity,\u201d the use must be public in its nature. A trust created for the use of a single individual or of a family is not a charity. In the case of Ommanney v. Butcher (1 Tur. & Russ., 260), the master of the rolls says: \u201cIt is competent to a testator to direct his executors to give to his poor relations; that is not a charity, but it is a trust to give to poor relations.\u201d Again he says: \u201cThere is no case in which private charity has been made the subject of disposal in the crown, or been acted upon by this court. The charities recognized by this court are public in their nature.\u201d\nAnother distinction is, between those cases where the use is for a corporation or some recognized public body capable of bringing a suit, and cases where no beneficiary competent to come into court as a party is designated. There is no doubt that where the beneficiary of the use for which a trust was created for any of the purposes enumerated in the statute of Elizabeth was a corporation, as a college, an incorporated hospital, school, or the like, the court of chancery had jurisdiction, prior to either of the statutes of Elizabeth, to enforce the use upon an original bill in the name of the corporation; and as such trusts were afterwards recognized as \u201c charities,\u201d to this extent it may be justly said that the court of chancery had an inherent jurisdiction over charitable uses prior to and independent of that act.\nIt is equally plain that, where no beneficiary competent to sue was named, as where the trust was created in general terms, as to establish or found a public school, an asylum for the poor, or the like, without designating any particular persons or body of persons to be benefited, there was no legal means whatever, prior to the statutes of Elizabeth and to the use of informations in the name of the attorney-general, of enforcing the execution of the use. Although such uses were held good by the courts in proceedings in behalf of the crown, under the statute of 1 Edward VI., ch. 14., for a forfeiture of the property (Adams & Lambert\u2019s case, 4 Coke, 1046), so that the right of the trustee to the property was recognized; yet there was no legal mode in which such trustee could be compelled to perform the trust, because no party would exist competent to bring a suit for that purpose. Even in cases where the particular locality \u2022or town to be benefited by the use was named, although suits had been sometimes brought and sustained in the name of \u201cthe inhabitants\u201d of such town, or in the name of several individuals in behalf of themselves and all others interested in the use, yet the history of the case of the Free Grammar School of Northleech suggests a doubt whether this practice was not attended with serious difficulty. We see, therefore, the imperious necessity which existed for some new mode of proceeding, by which public uses of this general nature could be enforced, as well as the reasons for the peculiar kind of tribunal created by the statutes of 39 and 43 Elizabeth. The proceedings before the commissioners were not m the form of a suit inter partes; but the commissioners were to inquire \u201c as well by the oaths of \"twelve men or more of the county, as by all other good and lawful ways and means.\u201d They could proceed, therefore, upon such information as they could obtain, and were not governed by any technical rules. One principal object of the statute manifestly was to avoid this difficulty as to parties.\nInformations in the name of the attorney-general were another device to meet the same difficulty. The uses to be enforced being public in their nature, these informations brought the real beneficiary, the king in his character of parens patriae, before the court, through his legal representative the attorney-general. This remedy was entirely independent of the statute of Elizabeth, being based solely upon the ordinary judicial power of the court combined with the prerogative of the crown, and was so apt and appropriate that it is a matter of surprise that it had not been sooner resorted to.\nBut the providing of a remedy for a class of uses which\u00bb could not\" be enforced by any existing form of proceeding, although the principal was nevertheless not the sole motive for the enactment of the statute of 43 Elizabeth. It had two other objects. One was to specify the uses excepted out of the statute of 23 Henry VIII., ch. 10, being the uses called \u201c good and godly \u201d in the preamble to the statute of 1 Edward VI, but afterwards more appropriately termed \u201c charitable.\u201d The other was to relieve this favored class of trusts from the operation of some of the stringent rules of the common law. To prove the first of these objects, more can hardly be needed than to glance at the statute of Henry VIII., with its sweeping condemnation of uses in general; then at the preamble to the statute of 1 Edward VI., with its imperfect specification of charitable uses, and finally at the embarrassment which\" must have been created by the want of such a specification. It was evidently, in part, to meet the difficulty of determining what uses were to be deemed charitable, as distinguished from superstitious, that the statute of Elizabeth was passed.\nBut I have said that another object was to exempt charities from some of the more rigid of the common law rules applicable to trusts. This is, I think, plainly to be inferred: First. From the language of the statute itself. Its phraseology is . peculiar : \u201c Whereas, lands, tenements, rents, annuities, profits, hereditaments, goods, chattels, money, &c., have been heretofore given, limited, appointed and assigned,\u201d &c. Why were these words \u201climited, appointed,\u201d &c., used instead of the ordinary words, granted, devised, bequeathed, &c. ? This could not have been accidental, because the statute was drawn by Sir Francis Moore, to whom the duty was specially asssigned by parliament. (Duke on Uses, by Bridgman, 122, note.) Now, an eminent lawyer, like Sir Francis, would never have departed so widely from the ordinary legal language without an object; and the only conceivable object is, to uphold certain uses which, by the established rules applicable to grants, devises, bequests, &c., would be void. But: Second. That this was one of its objects, if not apparent upon the face of the statute, is most abundantly shown by the construction put upon it by the courts, and by the uniform practice under it. The first case to which I will refer to show the force given to the words \u201climited and appointed \u201d is that of Jesus College or Flood's case (Hob., 136; Duke, 78). In 25 Elizabeth, one Griffith Flood had devised certain lands first to his wife for life, then to his daughter for life, and afterwards to the principal, fellows and scholars of Jesus College, in Oxford. The estates for life being ended, the heir of Griffith Flood entered. A case was then made, which was referred to Chief Baron Tanfield and Lord Hobart; and the latter reports their decision as follows: \u201c We agreed that the devise was void in law, because the statute of wills did not allow devises to corporations in mortmain; but yet we hold it clearly within the relief of the statute of charitable uses, 43 Elizabeth, under the words \u2018 limited and anointed.\u2019 \u201d This case was decided only fifteen years after the statute of Elizabeth was passed. Two years later, Collison\u2019s case, called, in Duke, Roll\u2019s cas\u00e9, arose before Lord Keeper Bacon. (Hob., 136; Duke, 73.) Collison, in the 15th Henry VIII., had devised a house to his wife for life, and then to feoffees, in trust, to keep it in repair, and \u201cto bestow the rest of the profits upon the reparation of certain highways.\u201d The case was between the parishioners and Bolt, who claimed as heir, and was referred, like the last case, to Lord Hobart and the chief baron. Hobart reports their decision thus: \u201c And we resolved clearly that it was within the relief of the statute of 43 Elizabeth. For though the devise were utterly void, yet it was within the words \u2018 limited and appointed to charitable uses.\u2019 \u201d The objection to the devise is not stated in Hobart, but Duke shows that it was that the devise was made before the statute of wills. In 1622, five years after Collison\u2019s case, Stoddard\u2019s case was decided in chancery. Stoddard had bequeathed by parol a yearly rent of ^10, out of his house called the Swan, with one hundred marks, in the Old Jewry, London, for the maintenance of two scholars in Oxford and Cambridge; and directed one Hugh, a scrivener, to reduce it to writing, which was done. The will was held good. Duke says : \u201c For, although by law a rent cannot be created without deed or will in writing, yet this nuncupative will was good to create the rent to a charitable use, by the words of the statute, \u2018 a limitation or. appointment;\u2019 for, although it be not a good gift, yet it is a good limitation or appointment.\u201d (Duke, 81.) A few years later the case of Platt v. St. John\u2019s College came before Lord Keeper Coventry. (Cas. in Ch., 267; Duke, 77.) The ancestor of Platt bad devised his lands to the college by a wrong name, \u201c but the lord keeper decreed it a good appointment for a charitable use within the statute of 43 Elizabeth, although before the statute no such decree could have been made.\u201d\nThese four cases, decided upon the heel of the statute of Elizabeth, conclusively prove that whatever may have been the object of the statute, its effect, as construed by the courts, was to cure all defects in gifts to charitable uses, whether such defects depended upon the rules of the common law, or upon positive statutory provisions.\nBut there are several cases which expressly declare that such was its object and intent. In the case of Christ's Hospital. v Hawes, which arose in 1620 (Duke, 84), a tenant in socage had devised all his lands to a hospital, although by the statutes of 32 and 34 Henry VIII. he was authorized to devise only two-thirds. It was insisted that this was good for the w'hole land as a limitation and appointment under the 43d Elizabeth, on the ground that the object of that statute was to supply all defects in assurances for \u2022charitable uses ; and, according to Duke, the lords commissioners, keepers of the great seal, would have so held, but the parties agreed. Again, in Attorney-General v. Rye, before Lord Keeper Wright, in 1703 (2 Vern., 453), a tenant in tail had devised lands for the support of a schoolmaster, and other charitable uses. The question was whether such a devise was good without fine or recovery; and the lord keeper held that \u201cthe intent of the statute of Elizabeth being to make the disposition of the party as free as his mind, and not 'to oblige him to the observance of any legal forms, the devise was good.\u201d\nIt is plain from these cases, as well as from the whole series of subsequent -cases on the subject, that the law of charitable uses, as afterwards administered, derived much of that peculiar force by which it was made to supersede most of the technical rules of the common law applicable to trusts, as well as many positive statutes, from the construction thus given to the words \u201climited and appointed\u201d in the statute of Elizabeth. ' This, however, was not the only source of the peculiar features of that law. As we have seen, the same causes which produced the statute of Elizabeth led also to the practice of filing informations in chancery in the name of the attorney-general, and with these informations was introduced into the administration of charities some portion of the royal prerogative, which contributed, in combination with the broad construction given to the statute, to produce the charitable code of England. It seems to me clear that all that is distinctive and peculiar in the law of charities is to be traced to one or the other of these sources.\nAlthough, as before remarked, there was. a class of charitable uses of which the court of chancery took cognizance upon original bill, prior to the statute, that is, uses created for the benefit of corporations, or of recognized public bodies, such as towns, yet the jurisdiction exercised in such cases, so far as we have any authentic evidence on the subject, was simply the ordinary jurisdiction of the court \u00bfver trusts. It does not appear from any record of those cases, which has come down to us, that the court ever assumed, prior to the statute of Elizabeth, any of those extraordinary powers in respect to charities which it so liberally exercised afterwards; and when to this negative proof is added the fact that in all the early cases the judges uniformly referred to the words \u201climited and appointed,\u201d in the statute, as the authority for their decisions, little doubt, as it seems to me, can remain -that we are to look to the statute as the principal source of this peculiar jurisdiction. This conclusion is still further strengthened by the fact that, since the statute of Elizabeth, no uses have been regarded as \u201c charitable,\u201d in a legal sense, except those which were within the letter or spirit of the statute. Judge Story says : \u201c It is very certain also, that since the statute of Elizabeth no bequests are deemed within the authority of chancery, and capable of being established and regulated thereby as iharities, except bequests for the purposes which that statute enumerates as charitable, or which by analogy are deemed within its spirit and intendment.\u201d (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 1155.) I shall cite but a single case .to show the truth of this remark, as the point admits of no dispute. In Monroe v. Bishop of Durham (9 Ves., 399), the master of the rolls, Sir William Grant, says: \u201cIs this a trust for charity? Do purposes of liberality and benevolence mean the same as 6 objects of'charity ?\u2019 That word, in its widest sense, denotes all the good affections men ought to bear to each other; in its most restricted and common sense, relief of the poor. In neither of these senses is it employed in this court. Here its signification is derived chiefly from the statute of Elizabeth. Those purposes are considered charitable which that statute enumerates, or which, .by analogy, are deemed within its spirit and intendment.\u201d In the same case, which afterwards came before the chancellor upon appeal (10 Ves., 522), Lord Eldon says: \u201cLooking back to the history of the law upon this subject, I say, with the master of the rolls, that a case has not yet been decided in which the court has executed a charitable purpose, unless the will contains that which the laio acknowledges to be a charitable purpose.\u201d It is plain that by the word \u201c law,\u201d as here used, the chancellor meant the statute of Elizabeth. Again he says, speaking of that statute: \u201c I believe the expression 1 charitable purposes,\u2019 as used in this court, has been applied to many acts described in that statute and analogous to those, not because they can with \u2022 propriety be called charitable, but as that denomination is, Tby the statute, given to all the purposes described.\u201d\nNow, there were many other uses for benevolent purposes, which, independently of the statute, would have commended themselves to the favor of the court as strongly as those enumerated in it. If, then, the peculiar law of charities existed at common law, prior to the statute, how did it happen that it was confined in its application to the particular uses there specified? This restriction is perfectly in accordance with the supposition that the law was founded upon the statute, but somewhat difficult of explanation upon any other theory.\nIn my reference to authorities I have confined myself mainly to those which were either cotemporary with the statute of Elizabeth, or immediately prior or subsequent thereto, because I hold it to be clear that Lord Ellesmere, Sir Edward Coke, Sir John Popham and other eminent lawyers of that period must have better understood the state of the law in their own times, and the effect and object of a statute just then passed, than any lawyers, however distinguished, who lived a century and a half afterwards. The language of Lord Hardwicke, in Corporation of Buford v. Lenthall (2 Atk., 550), shows how liable we are to be misled by the modern cases. He says: \u201c The courts have mixed the jurisdiction of bringing information in the name of the attorney-general with the jurisdiction given them under the statute, and proceed either way according to their discretion.\u201d It is entirely hopeless, therefore, to attempt to ascertain the extent of the original jurisdiction of the court, unless attention is principally confined to a period anterior to this commingling of jurisdictions. For similar reasons I have omitted to refer to the American cases, which are in conflict\u201dwith each other. To ascertain the nature of charitable uses we must look to the records, in which alone the origin and history of those uses are to be found.\nIt follows from this reasoning that, in determining the extent of the jurisdiction of .the courts of this state over charitable trusts, we are to look to the jurisdiction exercised by the court of chancery in England over trusts in general. It having been held by this court, in the case of Williams v. Williams (4 Seld., 525), that trusts for religious and charitable purposes are not within our statute of uses and trusts, or that concerning the creation of perpetuities, we are without any restrictions upon this class \u25a0 of trusts, except those which are derived from the rules and principles of the common law. We are to look, therefore, to those principles to determine the validity of this devise. As charitable uses, like all other uses, comprise a trust as well as a use, it is obvious that they are liable at common law to two classes of defects, one affecting the trust and the other the use. To constitute a valid use, there must be, in all cases, first, a trustee legally competent to take and hold the property; and secondly, a use for some purpose: clearly defined.\nNow, if it be admitted that the court of chancery in England, in its anxiety to support uses deemed specially meritorious, had, independently of the statute of Elizabeth, somewhat relaxed the rigid rules of the common law in regard to the certainty required in the specification of the use, there is still no evidence that it ever assumed to dispense with that rule which required that there should in all cases be a competent trustee of the fund.\nIt is true that where trustees capable of taking the legal estate were originally appointed, so that a valid use was in the first instance raised, and t.he case was thus brought within the jurisdiction of the court of chancery, that court would not afterwards suffer the use to fail, but wmuld supply any defect which might arise in consequence of the death or disability of the trustees by appointing new trustees in their place; but when no competent trustees were in the first instance appointed, so that no legal estate ever vested, of course no use was raised, and the court of chancery acquired no jurisdiction of the case. ,\nThe want of a competent trustee is precisely that which distinguishes this case from that of Williams v. Williams {supra), decided by this court. In that case, the disputed legacies were given to the trustees of an incorporated society, and to three individuals by name. This circumstance is referred to and relied upon by the court. Denio, J., says: \u201c There is here a good trustee to take the funds in the first instance; and a succession of trustees may be provided by the. court, by new appointment, as often as circumstances may require. The trust is for the education of the children of the poor, at a particular institution of learning, which I .presume to be an incorporated academy, and a rule of ready application is given for selecting the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty.\u201d No inference can be drawn from the decision in that case that the court would have supported the legacy if given to a voluntary unincorporated society.\nWe have one direct authority, occurring just about the time when the statute of Elizabeth was passed, showing that a charitable devise to persons unincorporated could not then be sustained. I refer to the case of The Mayor, &c., of Reading v. Lane (Duke, 81). There a devise was made to \u201cthe poor people maintained in the hospital of St. Lawrence, in Reading, for ever.\u201d No designation of any unincorporated body could be more definite than this; and yet it was conceded that they could not take. The devise, however, was sustained as a good devise to the mayor and burgesses, who were a corporation, and authorized to take lands in mortmain.\nThere is little in the history of charitable uses in England to encourage .the courts of this country in violating the ordinary rules of law in their efforts to sustain a particular class of trusts. All partial legislation and strained judicial construction in favor of particular interests tend to disturb that social equality which general and uniform laws, operating in connection with the natural impulses of men, are calculated to produce. Thus, the law of charitable uses in England found its appropriate finale in the statute of 9 George II., ch. 36, which cut off all such uses, if charged in any way upon lands, unless created by deed twelve months before the death of the donor. The preamble to that statute is as follows: \u201cWhereas, gifts or alienations of lands, tenements or hereditaments, in mortmain, are prohibited or restrained by magna chana and divers other wholesome laws as prejudicial to and against the common utility, nevertheless this public mischief has of late greatly increased, by means of large and improvident alienations or dispositions, made by languishing or dying persons, or by other persons, to uses called charitable uses, to take place after their deaths, to the disherison of their lawful heirs: for remedy whereof be it enacted,\u201d &c.\nWe may look for legislation of the same stringent character here, if our courts follow the example of the English chancellors in applying a peculiar and partial system of rules to the support of charitable gifts. My convictions are decidedly against both the policy and legality of such a course; and I am constrained, therefore, to hold that a devise to an unincorporated missionary society is void.\nTo avoid misapprehension, it may be proper to add that nothing which has been said is intended to deny the power \u25a0of courts of equity in this state to enforce the execution of trusts created for public and charitable purposes, in cases where the fund is given to a trustee competent to take, and where the charitable use is so far defined as to be-capable of being specifically executed by the authority of the court, even although no certain beneficiary other than the public at large may be designated. For example, devises or bequests to trustees for the purpose of founding a public library, a school, a hospital, or the like, create legal and valid trusts. This is precisely the class of trusts, as already shown, which gave rise both to informations in chancery, in the name of the attorney-general, and to the statute of 43 Elizabeth. The remedy afforded by the statute has no application in \u2022this state; but the remedy by information, so far as it was a common law remedy, is as available here as in England, although it must undoubtedly be modified so as to conform to our different modes of proceeding. Informations have been said to be a prerogative remedy, and it is true that the jurisdiction exercised upon them was in some degree strengthened and extended by a resort to the royal prerogative; but it is nevertheless plain that such informations were the natural result of the application of common law principles and forms of proceeding to those particular cases, and that they could be and were sustained independently of prerogative. Here this remedy must assume the form of -an ordinary suit in the name ot the attorney-general, or perhaps of the people of the state, and would be limited in its scope by the principles of the common law. I see no reason why, to this extent, it may not be administered by our courts.\nThe judgment of the supreme court in this case should be affirmed.\nDenio, C. J.\nAssuming that tlie unincorporated society, which existed at the time of the execution of the will in question, and which was subsequently incorporated, is sufficiently pointed out by the description in the will to enable us to say that it is the body intended by the testator, it becomes necessary to inquire whether the trust is one which can be executed by the court as a charitable use. The testator is presumed to have intended to appropriate the fund for the advancement of the objects which the society was formed to promote. It is shown that the corporation, which is the appellant in this case, is identical in its purposes with the voluntary association which was absorbed by the act of incorporation. These purposes, as expressed in the act of incorporation, are, \u201c to diffuse more generally the blessings of education, civilization and Christianity throughout the United States and elsewhere.\u201d Trusts in favor of education and religion have always been considered charitable uses. They are expressly mentioned in the statute of 43 Elizabeth, which, in regard to the definition of charities, was declaratory of the common law. But the advancement iff civilization generally is not classed among charities in the statute, and I have not been able to find an adjudged case in which it has been held to fall within the legal notion of charity. The term undoubtedly includes instruction in learning and the arts, but it embraces much more. It includes all those improvements in individual, social and political life which tend to meliorate the condition of men. A more general term could scarcely be chosen. In cases where there is a trust annexed to a bequest, but it is not such a trust as the court can execute as a charitable gift, the beneficial interest belongs to the next of kin. (Fowler v. Garlike, 1 Russ. & Mylne, 232.) In Browne v. Teale (referred to in, 7 Ves., 50, note), personal estate was given by will to trustees to be from time to time forever applied \u201c to the purchasing of such books as by a proper disposition of them, under the following directions, might have a tendency to promote the interests of virtue and religion and the happiness of mankind; the same to be disposed of in Great Britain or in any other part of the British dominions; this charitable design to be executed by and under the direction and superintendency of such persons, and under such rules and regulations, as under any decree or order of the high court of chancery shall from time to time be directed in that behalf.\u201d Lord Thurlow held that it was not a trust which the court could execute, and that the next of kin were entitled to the fund. In Morice v. The Bishop of Durham (9 Ves., 399; 10 id., 521), a testator had bequeathed all his personal estate to the Bishop of Durham, upon trust, after the payment of debts and legacies to dispose of the residue to such objects of benevolence and liberality as the bishop in his own discretion should most approve of. The master of the rolls (Sir William Grant) was of opinion that the trust could be completely executed without bestowing any part of the residue upon purposes strictly charitable, and that .it could not therefore be said that the fund was given to charitable purposes; and as the trust was too indefinite to be disposed of for any other purpose, it was held that the fund should be disposed of among the next of kin tif cbe testatrix. This decree was affirmed by Lord Eldon. In the course of the opinion the lord chancellor remarked that it was not contended, and that it was not necessary to support the decree to contend, that the trustee might not consistently with the intention have devoted every shilling to uses in that sense charitable. But the true question, he said, was whether he might not equally, according to the intention, have devoted the whole to purposes benevolent and liberal, and yet not within the meaning of charitable purposes as understood by the court. If he could do so, and it was his opinion that he might, he could not be called to account for maladministration. He therefore held that the court could not decree the execution of the trust. In the case before the court the legatees might expend the fund for purposes pro-motive of universal civilization, which still would not be charitable objects in the understanding of the law.\nThis being, - therefore, clearly a case in which the law of charitable uses does not aid the bequest, and does not in truth in any way apply, we are not called upon, or in my j udgment at liberty to review the cases which have been determined upon that branch of the law. The case is submitted to us without argument, upon written points, which assume that the case of Williams v. Williams, lately decided in this court, lays down the law as held in this court in regard to charitable trusts. (4 Seld., 524.) It has long been a subject of dispute in the courts of this country whether the peculiar jurisdiction of equity in respect to charities originated in the statute of charitable uses. If it did it was abrogated when that statute was repealed. If it was a portion of the jurisdiction of the English court of chancery, independently of that statute, it is in force in this state, according to the constitution, and to be enforced by the courts until repealed or modified by the legislature. So far as this court is concerned, the question has been settled in favor of the jurisdiction in the case just referred to. It is, no doubt, competent for us to reexamine that judgment, though for obvious reasons we ought to be reluctant to disturb a decision deliberately made here; and we should not do it except in rare and exceptional cases. Our judgments arc precedents for the courts of original jurisdiction, and they are, moreover, evidence of the law upon which the citizens of the state are accustomed to act, and upon which they ought to be allowed to act safely. A question upon which so much may be said upon both sides, and upon which so much argument has been expended, should be considered as at rest when it has been determined in this court. It is the more necessary to adhere to this principle when we take into consideration the constitution of the court. A change of one-half, or of a greater number of the judges takes place annually, and if the rule be established that every judgment which we give is open to reinvestigation upon any change of the members of the court, the legal rules upon which the community are to act will be subject to continual fluctuations, and nothing can be considered as settled; and whenever it is proper to review one of our own decisions, it should be done in a case where the same question again arises, and has been presented, at least, if not argued by counsel.\nI am in favor of affirmance, for the reasons which I have stated.\nA. S. Johnson, T. A. Johnson, Hubbard and Wright, Js., concurred in the opinion delivered by Selden, J., and were in favor of aifirming the judgment of the supreme court, for the reasons therein stated.\n\u2022They, the four judges above named, - with Denio, C. J., and Comstock, J., were of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground that the object of the charity was not sufficiently defined by the terms of the will. Selden, J., expressed no opinion as to this last proposition; and Comstock, J., none as to the questions discussed in the opinion of Judge Selden.\nMitchell, J., dissented, and was of the opinion that the \u25a0 judgment of the supreme court should be reversed, and the decree made by the surrogate affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed"},{"case_name":"Miller v. Chittenden et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2271634\/","date":"1856-01-01","court":"Iowa Supreme Court","content":"Stockton, J.\nThe objection taken by Marshall, to the claim set up by the trustees to the land conveyed to them by McKean, is, \u201c that at the time the deed was ex ecuted, there was no Congregational Church at Keokuk, in an organized or unorganized form; nor was there any associated body of persons to which the grantor referred or intended to refer.\u201d The conveyance from McKean to Chittenden, passed a naked title; and, in terms, excluded the possibility of their having an interest or use. The use was separated from the legal title. The cestui que trust indicated in the deed, was not in existence, so that it was impossible for it to vest. It must return to the vendor Ve state the position assumed by Marshall, in the words of his counsel. It may be stated by them in different form and language, but it always comes to the same thing \u2014 there was no church in existence to take the beneficial interest in the property conveyed ; the trustees had no power to bring the church into existence; and the conveyance to Marshall, by the heirs of McKean, was a revocation of the grant.\nIn the first place, we have to say, that it was not contemplated by McKean, that the church was organized at the date of the deed, and the gift was not one in present\u00ed, to take effect immediately upon its execution. It is for the use, benefit and support of the First Orthodox Congregational Church which shall be organized at Keokuk, that he gives the land. He directs the trustees what they shall do with the land, until such church is organized. He knew there was no such church then in existence, and it was to aid in its organization and support, that the donation was made. If, then, McKean\u2019s heirs were entitled to the land, the deed was void ah initio. It conveyed no interest to the trustees, and it is immaterial whether they took possession of the land or not. It is immaterial how many Congregationalists there were in Keokuk at the time of its execution. It is immaterial whether the church has since been organized or not. There was no beneficiary in existence at the time, to take the trust estate, and therefore no interest passed. Such is the position and argument for' Marshall. It will not, perhaps, be controverted, that by an executory devise, a freehold may be made to commence in futuro, and no particular estate is necessary to support it. The future estate is to arise upon some specific contingency, and the- fee simple is left to descend to the heir at law, until such contingency happens. 2 Blackf. 175. The number of contingencies is not material, if they are to happen within the limits allowed by law. The only question is, whether they are to happen within a reasonable time. 3 Peters, 115. In Inglis v. Trustees Sailors' Snug Harbor, the devise was to an association unincorporated, on its becoming incorporated. It was sustained by the court, on the ground that it did not purport to be a present devise to a corporation not in being, but a devise to take effect in futuro, upon the corporation being created; and the contingency was held not to be too remote. Eor the purpose of carrying into effect the intention of the testa-tor, courts will sanction any mode pointed out by him, consistent with the rules of law. They will not set aside the intent, because it cannot take effect as fully as the testator intended, but let it work as far as it can. 4 Yesey, 325; 12 Mass. 543; 3 Binney, 162. It has been held, that if the corporation for whose use the property is intended, is not in esse, and cannot come into existence, but by some future act of the crown, the gift is valid, and the court will execute it. White v. White, 1 Bro. Ch. 12. In such instances, the distinction must be observed between a devise to take effect in present\u00ed, and the same devise to take effect in futuro. In the Baptist Association v. Hart's Exrs., 4 Wheaton, 1, the court considered the bequest gone for uncertainty as to the devisees, and because the society, not being incorporated, was incapable of taking the trust. But if the testator in that case, had bequeathed the property to the Baptist Association, on its becoming, thereafter, and in a reasonable time, incorporated, there could not have been a doubt but that the subsequent incorporation would, even in the opinion of the court deciding that case, have conferred on the association the capacity of taking and managing the fund. -3 Peters, 114. The court would have felt itself bound to carry out' the intention of the testator. It is the general rule, says Johnson, J., in Inglis v. Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 144, that where there is a present immediate devise, there must exist a competent devisee, and a present capacity to take. But it is equally true, that if there exists the least circumstance from which to collect the testator\u2019s contemplation or intention of anything else than an immediate devise, to take effect in present\u00ed, then, if confined within legal limits, it is good as an executory devise. In McIntyre Poor School v. Zanesville Canal and Manufacturing Company, 9 Ohio, 203, it was held, that a bequest to charitable uses, may take effect as an executory devise to a corporation subsequently acquiring a capacity to take; and in the following cases it has been held, that a devise to a future incorporation is good: Porter's Case, 1 Coke Rep. 22; Coggeshall v. Pelton, 7 Johnson Ch. 292; Mylne v. Mylne 17 Louisiana Ch. 46.\nThe questions discussed in the case before us, arise under the deed by McKean to the trustees, and not under a devise by will. Eor Marshall, it is claimed, that this conveyance passed no estate, for the purposes of charity, because there was, at the time, no Congregational Church organized and in existence, to take the beneficial interest. In respect to conveyances between individuals, it is well settled, that every deed must have sufficient certainty as to the grantee who is to take under it. If it cannot be known who is to take, the grant is void, for the uncertainty. So, where the cestui que trust is incapable of taking the gift, the intervention of trustees does not remove the difficulty. And in general, it may be stated, that there is the same necessity for a cestui que trust, capable of taking the beneficial interest, that there is for a properly defined grantee in a deed. In this case, there must either be a cestui que trust capable of taking the use, or some overruling reason, why it should not be governed by the well settled rules of law; otherwise, the estate descended to the heirs of McKean at his death. Was the use bad to which McKean conveyed the land? The question is not whether the gift was void, because the church was not in existence. McKean knew the church was not organized. It was not a mistake on his part, in conveying to the use of a church, which was afterwards discovered to have no existence as a church organization. It was not a conveyance to take effect in present\u00ed. The grant is to the trustees, to appropriate the land, and all moneys arising from the sale, lease or rent thereof, to the use, benefit and support of the First Congregational Church which shall be organized at Keokuk. And until such church shall be organized, the trustees are to invest all moneys arising from the sale, lease or rent of said land, and allow them to accumulate, for the benefit of the church, until it is organized. The question then is, was the gift by McKean to the church, in contemplation of its organization, valid ? Was the use good?\n^Mfh conveyances have been held good in Maine, in the case of Shapleigh v. Pillsbury, 1 Greenleaf, 271; in Massachusetts, in the case of Rice v. Osgood, 9 Mass. 38; in New York, in the case of Reformed Dutch Church v. Veeder, 4 Wendell, 494; and in the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of the Town of Powlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 292, (3 Curtis, 358.) In these cases, it has been held, that if the lands are granted for pious uses, to a person or corporation not in esse, the right to the custody and possession of the lands remains in the grantor, until the person or corporation intended, shall come into existence, but the donor cannot resume the grant. If, on the other hand, the grant is made to individuals for the use of the church, which at the time of the grant is not incorporated as such, the persons to whom the grant is made, stand seized to the use, and when the church receives legal capacity to take and hold the real estate, the statute executes the possession to the use, and the estate vests. 4 Wend. 497. In Powlet v. Clark, Story, J., says: \u201cA donation by the crown to the use of a non-existing parish church, may well take effect by the common law, as a dedication to pious uses. After such a donation, it would not be competent for the crown to resume it at its own will, or alien the property, without the same consent which is necessary for the alienation of other church property.\u201d \u201c Before such church were duly erected and consecrated, the fee of the glebe would remain in abeyance, or at least, be beyond the power of the crown to alien, without the ordinary\u2019s consent.\u201d 9 Curtis, 332. As to the object to which McKean was desirous of dedicating a portion of his estate, there can be no mistake. He prefaces his donation, by declaring himself \u201c desirous to promote the cause of true religion in the said town \u201d of Keokuk. He sought to provide for the organization and support of an Orthodox Congregational Church at that place, and for the\" promotion of \u201c the cause of true Religion\u201d there, by means of the preaching of the gospel to its people by ministers of .that order. But, can it for a moment'be supposed, that the beneficial results sought to be accomplished, were intended by him to be limited to the communicants, or members of the organized church ? That would be \u00e1 very narrow view of the benefits to be conferred by the donor\u2019s bounty, which would restrict it to the Congregational Church\", whose organization was contemplated in the deed to the trustees. The 'beneficiaries were to be confined to no such narrow 'limits. The fund was, indeed, to be retained'until the particular church was organized. It w\u00e1s to be' administered, if you please, and \u201cthe caus\u00e9 of 'true religion promoted,\u201d by means of denominational teachers, holding the peculiar views and opinions 'in religious doctrine and church government understood to b\u00e9 entertained by Orthodox Congreg\u00e1tionalists. . But we think we can clearly see that it was within \"the contemplation of the donor,\u2019that \u00e9very inhabitant of Keokuk, of whatever order, faith, or'persuasion, was to 'receive \"the benefits of his bounty, and share in its 'effects:' They were all the beneficiaries, and the gift was \u00e1 charity in its largest and most comprehensive sense, as understood either in morals or in law, and a trust-'in the narrow and \"more restricted sense, as applied to conveyances between individuals,, which courts of equity have always recognized and enforced, \u201c It is'now too late,\u201d says Stout, J.,' 3 Peters, 482, \u201cto contend that a disposition to favor chaiity, \"can Be construed according to the rules which are applicable to individuals.\u201d Mc-Kean desired\u2019 this church to be\u2019 organized\u2019\"and supported 'in K\u00e9\u00f3'kuk,' not alone that\u2019it might be the means of furnishing r\u00e9lfgib\u00fcs privileges and' instruction to those who,' from' time'\"'\" to time, might become its members, but as the best means presented to him, of conferring a benefit upon the whole community in which it should be established.\nThis disposition to favor charity, was manifested by setting apart a portion of his estate for the support of the gospel, through the means and instrumentality of .the Congregational Church. There was no pecuniary consideration for the conveyance to the trustees. That was not necessary. Other considerations, quite as effectual and sufficient, moved him. The support of the gospel in a Christian country, is a sufficient consideration. 4 Wendell, 496. The objection that there was no beneficiary to take the use, is not sustained, either in law or fact. By direction of the grantor, and according to his intention, the estate vested in the trustees, until the beneficiaries for whom the charity was intended, were in a condition to call for the application of the fund in the hands of the trustees. Such appropriations have been held valid, upon principles other than those which ordinarily apply.between grantor and grantee, and are supported as dedications, to public and pious uses. 2 Cranch, 583.\nIs the use bad, because the trustees named in the deed of McKean, had no power to organize the church, or bring it into existence ? Although the trustees ha\u2018d no power to organize the church, in the sense in which they might, under a power conferred by deed or will, establish a school for indigent scholars,\u201d (1 Hawkins, 97,) or a college for the education of orphan children, (2 Howard, 127,) or an asylum for disabled seamen, (3 Peters, 99;) yet there was a duty devolved upon the trustees by the grantor, which shows that it was contemplated by him, that the fee should remain in them, subject to the capacity to be acquired by the persons of the Congregational faith in Keokuk as an organization, to require the appropriation and application of the fund. They were to sell, lease and rent the land, and invest the moneys arising therefrom, and-allow them to accumulate, until the church was organized. Although the church may not have been at this time in existence, there was still something to be done by the trustees, before the use was to vest. In what respect does the principle on which such a grant may be sustained, differ from that established in Shapleigh v. Pillsbury, The Reformed Dutch Church v. Veeder, and Powlet v. Clark ? Wherein does it differ from from that which Judge Story says was established by Porter\u2019s Case, 1 Coke Rep. 22, \u201c that if a feoffment is made to a general legal use, not superstitious, though indefinite,though no person is in esse who could be the cestui que use, yet the feoffment is good ?\u201d 3 Peters, 487. Courts are acting judicially, as long as they effectuate the intention of the donor. 4 Dana, 366.\nIn sustaining the grant to the trustees in the present case, we will not be supposed desirous of exercising any other than judicial powers in carrying out the intention of Mc-Kean, as manifested both in his deed and his will. In one class of cases, it has been held, that the doctrine of cy pres, as administered in England, is a judicial doctrine, in which cases a court of equity may substitute or sanction any other mode that may be lawful or suitable, and which will effectuate the declared intention of the donor. Moore's Heirs v. Moore\u2019s Devisees, 4 Dana, 355; Attorney-General v. Wallace's Devisees, 7 B. Monroe, 611. There is no necessity, however, in this case, for a resort to any such doctrine. No inadequate, illegal or inappropriate mode has been prescribed by McKean for making his charity available. The mode, prescribed by him has not failed. The trustees are ready and willing to carry it out on his own scheme, and the objects to be effected are identified and ascertainable. There is, therefore, no occasion for the exercise of a power, in England deemed a part of the prerogative of the sovereign, as parens patriae.\nIt is claimed for Marshall, that he purchased the interest-of McKean\u2019s heirs, for a valuable consideration; that the right to resume the grant was in McKean at his death, and descended to his heirs; and that by their conveyance, Marshall became possessed of a complete legal title to the land, which no subsequent organization of the church could divest. We admit that if Marshall\u2019s title was ever good, it is- good still. But it will readily be perceived that his title may be adjudged good and sufficient on one statement of facts made to the court, when it would not be so deemed when the whole or additional facts were made to appear. It might well be deemed sufficient, on demurrer to the bill in Chancery filed by him, to set aside the deed to the trustees, when it would be considered wholly insufficient when tested by all the facts shown in tbe record now before us. What right had the heirs of McKean to this land ? and what right had they to convey it to Marshall? McKean himself had manifested no disposition to resume the grant, up to the time of his death. By his will, made a short time before his decease, so far from intimating any such desire or intention, he confirms the grant, rather, and so far, such confirmation may be inferred from its express recognition. If the donation had been, and the land conveyed, for the benefit of a Congregational Church, which the donor erroneously supposed was in existence at Keokuk; if, at the time of McKean\u2019s death, and for a reasonable time thereafter, there had been no persons of the Congregational persuasion in Keokuk; if no attempt had been made to organize and establish a Congregational Church there; if the trustees had not accepted the trust, and taken possession of the land; and if there had been no recognition and confirmation of the grant by the testament and last will of the donor, the case might have presented such a state of facts, and there might have been such a failure of the cestui que trust, as that the heirs of McKean would have been entitled to resume the grant. But there is an entire lack of every essential element towards making out the: state of case on the part of Marshall, the claimant under the heirs. In the first place, the gift to the church was not to take. effect in present\u00ed, but only at such future and reasonable time as the church should be organized \u2014 the fee, in the meantime, remaining in the trustees, with power to sell, lease and rent the land, and accumulate the proceeds until the period of such organiza-' tion. In the second place, it is shown, that at the time of McKean\u2019s death, and since, there were persons of the Con-' gregational faith and persuasion residing at Keokuk, who being few in numbers, did not deem it advisable to establish a church in that place, until the funds arising from the charity of McKean, should be sufficient to furnish the means of supporting it, without too heavy a pecuniary burden upon themselves. Many of these persons were united temporarily with the Presbyterian Church of Keokuk, which, being identical in doctrine, so modified its discipline and church government as to render it substantially a Congregational Church. In the third place, it is shown, that at no time had the intention been abandoned of organizing such a church, so soon as the number and means of its friends became sufficient to sustain it; and that in the year 1854, an Orthodox Congregational Church was organized in Keokuk, for which the trustees, under the deed of McKean, are- now claiming the land in controversy, as dedicated by him, to its use. In the fourth place, it is shown, that immediately after the death of McKean, the trustees took possession of the land, leased a portion of the same, and that their possession has continued ever since; that this litigation respecting the title, commenced in 1849, shortly after the purchase by Marshall from the heirs; that the church would long since have been organized, and the benevolent intention of McKean carried into complete effect, but for the obstacles thrown in the way of such a consummation, by the.-very litigation which the claimants under the heirs have caused; and but for the cloud they have thereby- cast upon the title of the land, whereby, for all practical and useful purposes, it has been rendered unavailable; and finally, it is shown, that by the will of John McKean, executed in February, 1847, he recognized the conveyance made by him to the trustees, and the purposes for which it was made, and provided that other lands, by him devised to certain of his heirs, upon condition, should, on the failure of such condition, be vested in the same trustees appointed by his deed, for the same use and purposes therein mentioned.\nWe have to say, in conclusion, as an apology, if any should be deemed necessary, for this second opinion in this cause, after the full and able opinion of the chief justice, delivered at the June term, that after that opinion was delivered, a petition for a rehearing was filed by Marshall, the claimant under the heirs of McKean, and the cause was, in effect, re-argued by the counsel on both sides. The court have reconsidered the cause, both with reference to the new authorities cited, and others which have come under their notice. We have not been disposed to deny to the party, against whom, we have felt obliged to give our decision, the fullest opportunity of being heard, consistent with our other duties. This was due alike to the magnitude of the questions adjudicated, and to the ability and earnestness with which views, the opposite of our own, have been urged by the counsel. It is necessary, however, that the discussion should cease at some time, and the litigation be brought to an end. Having seen no good reason to change the views heretofore announced, the petition for a rehearing is overruled.\n[1]\n'Woodward, J., dissenting."},{"case_name":"Brooke & als. v. Shacklett; Carter & als. v. Wolfe","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4437734\/","date":"1856-04-01","court":"Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia","content":"DANIEE, J.,\ndelivered his opinion in the case of Brooke v. Shacklett, but it applies equally to both cases :\nIn the case of Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors v. Attorney General, 3 Eeigh 450, decided by this court in 1832, it was held that the courts of chancery in this state had no jurisdiction to enforce devises and bequests to religious societies or congregations. The court said, that as the statute of charitable uses, 43 Elia, under which alone such vague bequests could be established, if ever in force in Virginia, had been repealed in 1792, in the general repeal of English statutes, charitable bequests were to be treated as standing on the same footing with other bequests. If definite, they were to be treated as trusts which courts of equity would execute by virtue of their ordinary jurisdiction; but if indefinite, they were no longer recognized by law, and could not be enforced: And a devise or bequest of property to or for the uses of a religious congregation was, it was said, of the character last mentioned. It was too uncertain as to the beneficiaries.\nThe reasoning of the court, it is obvious, applies *with equal force to a conveyance of property to a religious congregation by deed.\nI do not deem it at all necessary to en-quire how far the decision in the case just cited may conform to the views of courts elsewhere in respect to this branch of the law, inasmuch as I am not aware that the authority of the case as a true exposition of the law in this state, has been ever seriously questioned. If, therefore, the law now stood as it did prior to the passage of certain acts whose provisions will be presently noticed, I should find no difficulty in holding that the bill of the appellee ought to have been dismissed as stating no case for .the jurisdiction of a court of equity. For though there can be no reverter of the property in question to the grantor or his heirs, inasmuch as the deed purports to be founded on a valuable consideration, and contains a warranty warranting to the trustees and their successors, the property, against the claim of the grantors, their heirs, and all persons claiming by or under them ; Yet the same indefiniteness as to the beneficiaries which defeated the bequest to the Roman Catholic congregation in Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors v. Attorney General, is to be found in the deed here, and would present an insuperable difficulty in the way of the court\u2019s undertaking to control the trustees in the performance of their duties, at the instance of a beneficiary in th\u00e9 deed, whether he claimed a use in the property as a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, or as a member of the congregation of that church, worshiping at Salem church-house. It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine the acts of assembly just mentioned, and to enquire whether the trusts of the deed can be brought within the scope of their provisions.\nThe first of the acts to which I refer, is the act entitled an act concerning conveyances or devises of places of public worship, passed February 3d, 1842. *This act in substance declares, that where any lot or parcel of land has been heretofore, or shall be hereafter, conveyed to one or more trustees for the use and benefit of any religious congregation as and for a place of public worship, the same and all improvements thereupon shall be held by such trustee or trustees, and their successors, for the purposes of the trust, and not otherwise; that where such conveyance or devise has been heretofore made to trustees, or where such conveyance or devise shall hereafter be made, whether by the intervention of trustees or not, the Circuit superior court of law and chancery for the county or corporation where the property is situate, shall, on application of the attorney for the commonwealth on behalf of the authorized authorities of any such religious congregation, have power and authority to appoint trustees originally where there were none, or to substitute others from time to time, in cases of death, removal from the county or corporation, or other inability to execute the trust beneficially and conveniently; and the legal title shall thereupon become exclusively vested in the whole number of the then trustees, and their successors. The act, after further providing that a majority' of the acting trustees of any such congregation may sue and be sued in relation to the title, possession or enjoyment of such property, concludes with a proviso, that such trustees, for the use of a religious congregation, shall not hereafter take or hold at any one time any tract of land in the country, exceeding in quantity thirty acres, or in any incorporated town, exceeding two acres; and that such real property shall not be held byr them for any other use than as a place of public worship, religious or other instruction, burial ground and residence of their minister. The next in order is the act of 1846-7, which gives to any one or more of the members of any religious congregation the right, in his or their \u2018names, on behalf of such congregation, to commence and prosecute a suit in equity against the trustees, to compel them to apply the property for the use or benefit of the congregation, as their duty shall require. In 1849 these acts were substantially re-enacted and are embodied in the Code, in the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth sections of chapter 77. The only material changes made by these sections of the Code in the provisions of the acts of 1842 and 1846-7, are those to be found in the eighth and tenth sections; by the former of which, validity is given not only to every conve3Tance and devise, but also to every dedication of property for the uses aforesaid; and by the latter of which it is declared that when books or furniture shall be given or acquired for the benefit of such congregation, to be used on the said land in the ceremonies of public worship, or at the residence of their minister, the same shall stand vested in the trustees having the legal title to the land, to be held by them as the land is held, for the benefit of the congregation.\nThere is, I think, nothing in the language of these laws to show that the legislature designed to confer peculiar benefits on any particular religious sect or sects. And the manifestation of any such design would not only have been utterly at war with the whole spirit of our institutions, but in direct conflict with the letter of the constitution declaring that the legislature \u201cshall not confer any peculiar privileges or advantages on any one sect or denomination. \u2019 \u2019 The terms of the acts are broad enough to embrace not only such congregations as may be independent of others, choosing their own pastors, and making the laws for their own government, but also such as may be united with other congregations under a common government, from which they may respectively receive the pastors that are to instruct them or the laws that *are to regulate them, without having any voice either in the selection or appointment of the former, or in the framing or enactment of the latter. And such is, I think, the obvious design of the legislature. The benefits which these acts confer are intended for any and every religious congregation, without regard to the peculiarities of religious faith or the forms of church government. It is, however, equally obvious that the conveyances, devises and dedications to which the acts mean to give validity, are conveyances, devises and dedications of property for the use of the \u201creligious congregations\u201d therein mentioned, in the limited and local sense of the term, viz: for the members (of these religious congregations) as such, who, from their residence at or near the place of public worship, may' be'expected to use it for such purpose. This interpretation is to be drawn from the general tenor of the acts, but more especially from the language of those portions of them that stand in the Code as the eighth and tenth sections of the chapter before referred to. The dedications of real estate must be made for the use of the 1 \u2018religious congregation, as a place for public worship, or as a burial place, or a residence for a minister;\u201d and that of the \u201cbooks and furniture,\u201d \u201cfor the benefit of such congregation, to be used on the said land in the ceremonies of public worship, or at the residence of their minister;\u201d uses, which it is plain, from their very nature and the connection in which they are mentioned, must belong peculiarly to the local society, \u201cthe religious congregation\u201d at or near the locality of the property conveyed. No dedication of property to religious uses, which does not respect these rights of the local society or religious congregation, no deed which does riot design such enjoyment of the uses of the property conveyed, by the local religious society or congregation, can be placed within the influence and protection, of the statutes.\n*The deed under consideration, in its first clause or declaration of trusts, provides that the trustees are to hold the property conveyed to them, and their successors forever, in trust that they shall build or cause to be built thereon a house or place of worship for the use of the members of the Methodist Episcopal church in the United States of America, according to the rules and discipline which from time to time may be agreed upon and adopted by the ministers and preachers of the said church, at their general conferences in the United States of America; and in further trust and confidence that they shall at all times forever hereafter permit such ministers and preachers belonging to said church, as shall from time to time be duly authorized by the general conferences of the ministers and preachers of the said Methodist Episcopal church, or by the annual conferences authorized by the said general conference, to preach and expound God\u2019s holy word therein.\nI am free to admit, that the first impression which this clause of the deed is calculated to make is that of a declaration of trust, not for the benefit of a local society, or congregation of Methodists worshiping or expected to worship at a particular place, but for the benefit of the \u201cMethodist Episcopal church in the United States as an aggregate body or sect,\u201d to the exclusion of any peculiar rights of property in the land conveyed, in such local society .or congregation. And if such is the true interpretation to be given the deed, it would plainly stand, for reasons already mentioned, out of the influence and operation of the statutes. Upon a fuller and more rigid examination of the deed, however, in which I have been much aided by the clear and forcible views presented by Chief Justice Marshall of Kentucky, in announcing the interpretation placed by . the Supreme court of that state, on a deed identical in its features with the deed under Consideration, (see Gibson v. Armstrong, 7 B. Monr. R. 481,) I have come to the conclusion that the deed is entitled to be regarded as substantially a conveyance of the property therein mentioned, to the uses of the local society. And that said property is thus placed within the pale of the statutes.\nIt is to be observed, as alread3r stated, that the house or place of worship to be erected is to be for the use of the members of the Methodist Episcopal church, &c. ; and as the members of the locdl society are necessarily members of the Methodist Episcopal church, in the sense in which the term is used in the deed, it follows that the land is conveyed for the benefit, to some extent at least, of the local society or congregation. It is to be noted further also, that except upon the happening of a certain contingency, the deed contemplates the perpetual use of the property as a place of worship. And it is obvious, from the nature of things, that the usual occupancy of the property, in attending upon the preaching and exhorations of their minister and in meeting for the observance of the various religious duties and exercises enjoined upon its members by the rules of the church, is one that can be enjoyed only by the local society; and that anj' use or occupancy of the house by other members of the church must be necessarily casual and infrequent; so much as not to interfere with the full use and enjoyment of it as a place of worship by the local members. -Hence it is fairly inferrible that the former use and not the latter was mainly if not exclusively within the contemplation of the parties to the deed. This view is made still more apparent in the subsequent declaration of the trusts. The deed proceeds to provide further, that in case one or more of the trustees die or cease to be a member or members of the said church, the stationed minister or preacher who shall have the pastoral charge of the ^members of the said church, (meaning plainly the society,) is to call a meeting of the remaining trustees, who, upon his nomination, are to appoint one or more. persons, who shall have been one year a member or members of said church, to fill such vacancy: showing that the minister provided for in the deed is to have charge of the members of the local society; who, consequently, are expected to attend upon and receive his religious instructions and ministrations ; and who are thus necessarily the members that are, peculiarly, to enjoy the occupancy of the house as a place of worship. And in the next and last clause, in which, upon a certain contingency, provision is made for the sale of the propert3r for the discharge of debts incurred by the trustees on account of the premises, the surplus arising from the sale, after paying the debts, is directed to be placed in the hands of the steward of the society attending divine service on the premises, and is to be disposed of b3' the next yearly conference, according to the best of their judgment, for the use of said society.\nDoes .not this provision strongly persuade to the conclusion of a design that, in the event no sale of the property is ever required, or until it is required, the immediate control and peculiar use of the property is to be and remain with the local society, by the contribution of whose members, in the main, (as is stated in the bill and not denied in the answer,) the church-house was erected, and to whose use the surplus proceeds of the property, in the event of a sale, are to be appropriated?\n\u201cThe primary object of the whole transaction, (in the language of Chief Justice Marshall in the case before cited,) must necessarily have been to provide and secure a place of worship according to the Methodist Episcopal discipline for the local society of that denomination, by and for which contributions *were made, and which was expected to attend worship on the premises. The members of the Methodist Episcopal church at large, not belonging to the local society, can, in a general view, have no other use of the local premises but through the instrumentality of the local society, and by means of the subordination of the local use to the laws and authority of the church at large.\u201d\nThe provision that the trustees are at all times to permit the ministers and preachers belonging to the Methodist Episcopal church, who shall be duly authorized by the conferences of the church,.to preach in the house to be erected, it is obvious, cannot in any degree detract from the character and effect of the deed as a dedication of property to the use and benefit of a religious congregation, in conformity with the statute. Eor ' the religious congregations, whose worship is not conducted under the lead and instruction of a minister, are comparatively few in number, and it is expressly provided in the statutes, as we have seen, that one of the uses to which the property dedicated may be applied, is, as \u201ca residence for a minister.\u201d The only ground, therefore, on which it can be argued that this feature of the deed places it without the pale of the statute, is, that it sanctions the appointment of the ministers, and authorizes them to use the house for preaching, without any reference to the vote or wish of the congregation. It is true, that under the deed, and according to the rules and discipline therein referred to, the local societies have no voice in the selection of their ministers. But it does not follow that the deed therefore fails to fulfill any requirement of the statute, or is in any regard in conflict with its spirit. It could not have been unknown to the legislature that a large number of the religious congregations in the state are in such predicament ; receiving their ministers from bodies who are bound by no rule *of church government to consult the preferences of the local societies or congregations in appointing the pastors who are to have charge of them. To declare the deed objectionable and invalid because of the feature in question, would therefore be to impute to the legislature the design of making a most unjust and invidious discrimination against all the congregations just mentioned, and in favor of those who have the selection of their own pastors. Such an idea is wholly inadmissible. Upon the whole, therefore, though some of the provisions of the deed, upon a first inspection, did seem to me to look another way, I am satisfied that it does import a substantial dedication of the property therein mentioned to the uses of the local society, and that we cannot reject it, without adopting in respect to it, rules of construction favorable to the defeat rather than the upholding of such instruments: And I cannot see that we have the warrant of any sufficient reason for such a course.\nThe dangers to be apprehended from church establishments, and the evils lilcelj' to flow from allowing them to.acquire property under such broad powers as were at one time claimed and exercised by the chancellor in England as representing the superintendency of the crown, as parens patriae, over charities, might be very properly looked to and considered by a court engaged, as this court was, in the case of Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors v. Attorney General, in enquiring whether it had been left free to exercise a jurisdiction, which when once admitted it had no power to limit by any well \u2018defined boundaries. The subject is however presented to our consideration under circumstances wholly different. The transfer and acquisition of property for religious purposes has been made the subject of a legislation in which the extent and the uses to which dedications of this character may be made, are precisely fixed and ascertained. The legislature has declared *that permanency may be legally assured to the houses of worship, the pastoral residences, and the burial places of the various religious congregations of the country. They have given the form and sanction of law to the opinion that the good to the community likely to result from placing the title to such property on a firm and certain footing, and thus putting an end, as far as the law can, to the unseemly disorder that might otherwise arise from leaving it to the uncertain tenure by which it has been hitherto held, is of such character and weight as to overbalance any vague apprehension that the object may not be attained without furnishing occasion for ecclesiastical encroachments dangerous to the institutions of the state. This course of the legislature has been approved by the convention of 1850-51, and in the 32d section of the 4th article of our new constitution it is declared, that the general assembly may secure the title to church property to an extent to be limited by law; whilst an additional guard against the dangers adverted to is thrown around the subject by a provision that there shall not be any grants of charters of incorporation to any church or religious denomination.\nIn passing now, therefore, on such a deed as the one under consideration, no jealousy of the extension of ecclesiastical power can be properly allowed to exert an influence in the selection of the rules of interpretation to be applied. On the contrary, we should rather favor that interpretation of the instrument which, consistently with the rules of construction, will place it within the operation of the changed policy of our legislation.\nThe deed being valid, as we must, I think, hold it to be, all doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court is ended; and we have decided which of the two parties litigant are entitled to the use of the property which the deed conveys. There is no dispute between *the parties about any matter of religious faith. The doctrines of the two parties are identical. Neither party denies that the ministers of the other are, in the doctrinal sense of the word, members of the Methodist Episcopal church. But it is most obvious that \u201csimply holding the same faith, without submitting to the government and discipline of a church, cannot make or keep a man a member of that church. To constitute a member of any church, two points at least are essential, without meaning to say that others are not so, a profession of its faith and a submission to its government. \u2019 \u2019 Den v. Bolton, 7 Halst. R. 215.\nThe local society of which both of the parties litigant claim to be members, is not a separate and independent society or congregation making its own laws, but is one of a large number of local societies belonging (prior to a division of the church which will be presently noticed) to the Methodist Episcopal church in the United States. According to the plan of church government,. annual conferences were composed of the traveling' preachers within certain boundaries fixed by the general conference. The preachers were received into the church by the annual conferences, and distributed or assigned to their several charges by the bishops. The general conference was composed of one for every twenty-one members of each annual conference appointed either by seniority or choice at the discretion of each annual conference; Yet so that such representatives should have traveled at least a certain number of years. The general conference elected the bishops, and had \u201cfull powers to make rules and. regulations for the church under certain specified limitations and restrictions.\u2019\u2019 The members of the local societies had no right to be represented by delegates either in the annual conferences or in the general conference. They had no voice in making the rules for the government of the church; none in the appointment or selection *of the preacher to whose charge they might be committed. If at any time before the division of the church a controversy had arisen among the members of the society at Salem church-house, in respect to the occupancy of the house \u2014 each party under the lead of a preacher claiming its exclusive use for purposes of worship \u2014 the dispute must have been determined by enquiring, not which of the two parties constituted a majority, or represented the wishes of a majority, of the members of the society, but which of the two preachers had been appointed and assigned to the society in accordance to the laws of the church; which of the two parties was acting in conformity with the discipline of the church, and submitting to its lawful government.\nThese views conduct us necessarily to the enquiry as to what effect the division of the church is to have on the control of the uses of the houses of worship by the local societies.\nI do not deem it necessary to go into,any statement of the causes which led to this division, which was effected under certain resolutions adopted by the general conference in 1844. The resolutions are preceded by a preamble setting forth that a declaration had been presented with the signatures of fifty-one delegates of the body from thirteen annual conferences in the slaveholding states, representing that for various reasons enumerated, the objects and purposes of the Christian ministry and church organization could not be successfully accomplished by them under the jurisdiction of the general conference as then constituted ; and that in the event of a separation, a contingency to which the declaration asked attention as not improbable, the conference esteemed it a duty to meet the emergency with Christian kindness and the strictest equity.\nThe first resolution declares^ that should the delegates *from the annual conferences in the slaveholding states find it necessary to unite in a distinct ecclesiastical connection, the following rule shall be observed with regard to the northern boundary of such connection: All the societies, stations and conferences adhering to the church in the south by a vote of a majority of the members of said societies, stations and conferences, shall remain under the unmolested pastoral care of the southern church (and the ministers of the Methodist Episcopal church shall in no case attempt to organize churches or societies within the limits of the church south; nor shall they attempt to exercise any pastoral oversight therein, it being understood that the ministry of the south reciprocally observe the same rule in relation to stations, societies and conferences adhering by vote of a majority to the Methodist Episcopal church) ; provided also that this rule shall apply only to societies, stations and conferences bordering on the line of division, and not to interior charges, which shall in all cases be left to the care of that church within whose territory they are situated.\nBy the second resolution it is declared that ministers, local and traveling, of ever3r grade and office in the Methodist Episcopal church may, as they prefer, remain in that church, or, without blame, attach themselves to the church south.\nAnd by the ninth it is declared that all the property of the Methodist Episcopal church, in meeting-houses, parsonages, colleges, schools, conference funds, cemeteries, and of every kind, within the limits of the southern organization, shall be forever free from any claim set up on the part of the Methodist Episcopal church, so far as this resolution can be of force in the premises.\nIn Ma3r of the following 3rear (.1845) delegates, regularly appointed by the several annual conferences of *the Methodist Episcopal church in the slaveholding states, met in Eouisville, Kentucky, in a general convention, and adopted b3' a vote (of ninety-four to three) a resolution by which they declare the jttrisdiction hitherto exercised over said annual conference by the general conference of the Methodist Episcopal church entirely dissolved; and that said annual conferences shall be and they hereby are constituted a separate ecclesiastical connection under the provisional plan of separation aforesaid, and based upon the discipline of the Methodist Episcopal church, comprehending the doctrines and entire moral, ecclesiastical and economical rules and regulations of said discipline, except only in so far as verbal alterations may be necessary to a distinct organization, and to be known by the style and title of the Methodist Episcopal church south.\nIf this division of the Church was lawful, it is obvious, I think, that the members of the local societies in the southern organization of the church stand in the same relation to the general conference, the annual conferences, the bishops, pastors, rules and discipline of the Methodist Episcopal church south, that they occupied before the division, in respect to those of the Methodist Episcopal church. There has been no change of faith, no change of doctrine, no change of discipline, no change in the mode of administering it: All remain as before. By the express terms of the plan of separation, no blame is to be attached to the pastors in the south for adhering to the church south; and the members of the local societies are to remain under the unmolested care of the southern church, as they were before under that of the Methodist Episcopal church. And the southern church is to occupy the same relation to the church property in the south that the Methodist Episcopal church before occupied in respect to it. If the division has been lawfully effected, why may not a controvers3r among the local *members of a society in respect to the use of the church property be settled by a resort to the same mode of enquiry, (merely changing the name of the church,) that would have determined it before? Upon the- hypothesis that the plan of separation is constitutional, the questions upon which such a controversy would now turn, would be, Which of the two parties is in regular connection with the Methodist Episcopal church south, recognizing its discipline, submitting to its government, and receiving its pastors? Those who can identify themselves with the party indicated in the enquiry, are entitled to the use of the property.\nWe have still to enquire, Whether the general conference of 1844 had the power to adopt the resolutions authorizing the division? If I had the largest freedom of time and space, I should not desire to pursue any very extended course of statement or of argument in considering this question. And I do not think that there is any necessity for my doing so. The question is one which has been deemed for some years past of such public concernment, of such vast importance in its bearing on the rights, interest and feeling of a large portion of the community, as to have been made the subject of the fullest examination. The zeal, ability and research of the most eminent men of the bar and of the church have been enlisted in its discussion. No fact or argument that could elucidate the subject remains to be stated or urged. Not only so, but the question has been decided by the Supreme court of Kentucky and by the Supreme court of the United States, upon such mature deliberation and with such unanimity, in each case, as to leave but little room for hesitating as- to the propriety of regarding the question as settled. In each case the validity of the plan of separation was sustained. Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. U. S. R. 288; Gibson v. Armstrong, 7 B. Monr. R. 481.\n*I deem it necessary to say but little more than that I concur in these decisions. I have not been able to perceive on what ground it is to be maintained that the general conference of 1844 was not invested with as full powers over the subject as any general conference that preceded it. The six restrictive articles adopted by the conference of 1808 and by succeeding conferences manifestly contain no limitation of power that can bear on the question. The ministers and preachers in whom resided the supreme power, had, when they assembled in 1784 to frame a government for the church, full power to place it under one or two or a still greater number of general organizations, if they had believed that the interests of the church woul'd be thereby promoted. And I do not see how it can be said that the general conferences of 1792, 1796, 1800, 1804 and 1808, composed as they were of the body of the ministers and preachers, did not each have the same power. And when they determined . at the last mentioned conference (1808) to meet no longer en masse, but thereafter, by a delegation from their own body, the provision, which they adopted, that the general conference should have full powers to make rules and regulations for the church, under the limitations and restrictions contained in the six restrictive articles just mentioned, amounted in substance to an authority to the delegates in conference thereafter to exercise all the powers (except those prohibited in said restrictive articles) that could at any time have been exercised by a full conference of all the ministers and preachers. No further limitation on the powers of the general conference having been subsequently made, it seems to me that the conference of 1844 was clothed with the power which it claimed and exercised.\nThe Baltimore conference sent no delegates to the Ivouisville convention, and in 1846 adopted resolutions ^declaring that they still regarded themselves a constituent part, of the Methodist Episcopal church in the United States. By virtue of this action of said conference, the society at Salem church being within 'the limits of that conference, would have been left to \u25a0stand in connection with the northern division of the church, as they stood before the division of the church; and the appellants, under the influence of the principles which I have endeavored to establish, would thus have been entitled, though a minority, to prevail in this controversy were it not for \"the provision in the first resolution of the plan of separation, by which the border societies have a right, by vote of a majoritj1- of its members, to choose to which jurisdictional division of the church they will belong. The members of Salem church, at a meeting which seems to have been fairly conducted, have determined, by a majority vote, to adhere to the church south.\nA still further question, however, remains to be settled, viz: Whether this is a border society? The boundaries of the annual conferences have been from time to time fixed by the general conference, but no boundaries have been fixed for the societies, stations and circuits. In this state of things, it is obvious that in some cases it may be extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to carry out the plan of separation. It is next to impossible to lajr down any general rule by which to define a border societj'. In some cases, however, as in the case of the Maysville Church, in 7 B. Monr. R. 481, and in the case of Clift Church, (which was argued with this,) the proximity of the houses of wqrship to a common boundary of two conferences was so close that no question seems to have arisen as to the claim of the societies to be regarded as border societies, in the meaning of the resolutions.\nOne of the witnesses expresses the belief that Salem society is not a border society, and that a portion of *Warrenton circuit is interposed between it and the Rappahannock river, which is the common boundary of the Virginia and Baltimore conferences. But some five or six other witnesses express the belief that Salem is a border society, and that no portion of the country between the church and the river is attached to the Warrenton circuit. The weight of this testimony is in favor of the proposition that it is a border society; and upon a question of the kind the conduct of the parties interested, as showing how they have regarded the matter, is entitled to much weight. The minority, by-going into a vote on the question, have treated it as one on which a vote might be properly taken; which would not be the case on any other hypothesis than that of the society\u2019s being a border society. And it seems to me, therefore, that this conduct of the parties, taken in connection with the other proofs in the cause, justifies us in treating this as a border society.\nBy the vote of a majority, the society has been placed, in the manner contemplated and allowed by the plan of separation, in jurisdictional connection with the ecclesiastical government of the Methodist Episcopal church south; which, by virtue of its organization under said plan, is now the lawful successor of the Methodist Episcopal church in respect to the disciplinary control and protection of the members of the church adhering to the southern division. And such members have now the same right to enjoy the church property which was held by their societies before the division, in exclusion of those who repudiate the authority of the Methodist Episcopal church south, and refuse to receive the pastors appointed by it, that they had, before the division and whilst in connection with the Methodist Episcopal church, to enjoy said property in exclusion of any who might have refused *to submit to the discipline and to receive the preachers of said last mentioned church.\nSuch being the views which I have taken of the case, it seems to me that the decree of the Circuit court is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, and that the bill should be dismissed.\nLEE and SAMUELS, Js., concurred in the results of the opinion of Daniel, J., but not in the views or reasoning.\nALLEN, P., and MONCURE, J., concurred in the opinion.\nDecree reversed."},{"case_name":"Miller v. Chittenden et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2268318\/","date":"1856-06-01","court":"Iowa Supreme Court","content":"Wright, C. J.\nIt is first objected, that the deed from McKean to the trustees, did not impart notice of its contents, because the certificate of acknowledgment was not in due form of law. If this was true, it could not, under the testimony, aid those who purchased from the heirs. The possession of this land by the trustees, and those claiming under them, as well as the known existence of this deed, as shown by the evidence, gave actual notice of an outstanding adverse title, and the sufficiency of this acknowledgment is, therefore, an immaterial question. If they had actual notice of this deed, they are affected by it, though there was no certificate of acknowledgment indorsed thereon. Blain v. Stewart, post. . It is next urged, that this being an action for partition, the equitable rights of the parties to this land, cannot now be adjudicated, but the case must be determined alone upon the legal title; or, in other words, that in such actions, the court will alone determine who has the legal title, and that if any person claims an equity, which he insists should draw to it the legal right, he must first, in an independent action, establish that equity, and that then a court of law will take cognizance of his claim. On this point, however, we have no difficulty. The plaintiff in his petition, expressly makes these trustees parties; sets forth what he says is their pretended claim to this land; and avers that while it is invalid, it is a cloud upon his title, and asks that it may be removed. The trustees in their answer, set up their title, and call upon the plaintiff, as well as the other defendants, to answer to their claim, as to a cross bill. This they afterwards do, not objecting in any way to \u2019the form of the answer made by the trustees, or to their right to have this title thus adjudicated; and then, as if to remove all possibility of difficulty, the parties, by an agreement in writing, expressly agree that the case shall \u201c be treated to all intents and purposes as a proceeding in chancery.\u201d Without inquiring whether there is technically a cross bill on file \u2014 whether the title under which the trustees claim is equitable, and mot legal \u2014 whether this court will, in an action to partition lands, act alone upon the legal estate \u2014 it is sufficient to say, that this objection comes too late. By all their acts and agreements, those that now object, have recog nized. the right of those claiming under the McKean deed, to have their title adjudicated in this case, yhatever its character, and we shall therefore so determine it.\nIt is next objected, that the property conveyed is more in amount and value, than could be held by any religious society under the statute in force when the deed was made. .In support of this position, we are referred to chapter 128, laws of 1843, 538. This, as well as the succeeding chapter, were repealed, however, by the act of February 7th, 184-1 (Laws of 1844, 4), and by the latter act must this question be judged. It provides: \u201cThat any religious society in this territory, by complying with the provisions of this act, may have perpetual succession by such name as shall be designated by such society, and by such name shall be legally capable of prosecuting and defending suits in any courts of law and equity in this territory; and shall have power and authority to contract, receive, acquire, hold, enjoy, bargain, and sell, lease, mortgage, convey, and dispose of any building or buildings, erected for public worship, with the land necessary therefor, a burying-ground and parsonage for such society, and such other property as shall be applied to the support of public worship in said society, and to such means of education and charity as may be therewith connected.\u201d This section, most clearly, does not limit the quantity or value of the property to be held, but alone restricts the purposes for which it is to be acquired and applied. It recognizes the objects or purposes therein specified, as worthy and well deserving legislative protection and sanction, and for these purposes, the power is given to these societies to acquire and hold property, which may be either real or personal. By this deed, this land and its proceeds, were to be held for the use and benefit of \u201c the first Congregational Church,\u201d without designating the particular purpose or purposes to which it was to be applied. It might, therefore, be held for and devoted to all or any of the objects designated by the statute. It, of course, could not be devoted to any other purpose.\nIf the church or trustees, should misapply the trust property, a different question would arise. As it stands, however, we see nothing to sustain this objection. As to the' power of ecclesiastical bodies, and other corporations, to hold lands for charitable or other purposes, see Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1187; 2 Black. Comm. 268 to 274; 4 \"Wheat. Appendix, note 1; Griffin v. Graham et al., 1 Hawk. 97. And that-the objection to the grant, because of its creating a perpetuity, or tending to lock up the land, does not apply, the trustees having the power to alienate and invest the proceeds, see last case above cited. Also, Moore's Heirs v. Moore's Devisees, 4 Dana, 354; Hillyard v. Miller, 10 Barr, 326; State v. Girard, 2 Iredell Ch. 210.\nThe only remaining question relates to the validity of the deed, dependent upon the existence of a beneficiary, capable of enjoying and holding the property conveyed. This question has been argued with zeal and ability. Counsel have manifested a commendable, and even unusual care in its preparation \u2014 a care fully commensurate with the importance of the case, and the intricate questions involved. And while many topics, bearing on the principal question, have been discussed in the argument, we shall confine ourselves alone, to such, as in our judgment, are proper for the final adjudication of this controversy. And in doing this, it is proper that we first ascertain and settle from this deed, its character, object, and purpose. Tbe evident intention of the donor was, to create a fund for the use and benefit of a church, which he desired to have organized, and built up in the city of Keokuk. The management of this fund he intrusted to five trustees by name, who at that time accepted the trust, and undertook to execute the same. The very words of the grant show, that there was no such church at that time organized in Keokuk, as could then take the land, and this is abundantly showi}, by the testimony, and not denied by the counsel for the trustees. Neither by the terms of the grant, had the trustees any power to bring the beneficiaiy or church into existence; nor is there any method therein designated, by which it may be created. The power of the trustees only extended to the holding, leasing, and selling of the land, and the investment of the money arising from stich sales and leases, for the use and benefit of such contemplated church organization, and the appropriation thereof to such purposes, when the church .should be so organized.\n\u25a0 From the testimony, outside 'of the deed itself, it appears that the trustees named, as also other persons in the city of Keokuk, were members of this particular denomination, but had no organized existence. In February, 1854, these persons, with others, first organized, or became incorporated, as a church of the character and name designated in the deed, which organization appears to have been contemplated for a number of years previous, and at no time to have been abandoned. Under these circumstances, the question presented for our determination, is this : Can a grant to trustees, for the use and benefit of a church to be afterwards organized\u2014 with no power in them to create the beneficiary, or to appropriate the land or funds arising therefrom, for any purpose, until such organization \u2014 be upheld, so as to pass the title, if such church shall afterwards (say in seven years, as in this case) be so created or brought into existence, as to acquire and hold property, or be the recipient of a charity ? This statement of the question, we think, is quite as strong, in view of the claims of the church, as can well be justified from all the facts. It is, however, as near in form and substance, that made by the counsel opposed to the church title, as we have been able to state it; and for. that reason, we shall so treat it, preferring as we always do, as far as possible to decide the very question presented. As already stated, this question has been most fully, and we may add, very fairly argued. Counsel have in their written and oral arguments, brought to our attention, all of the leading authorities in this country, and many of those in England, on the subject of grants and devises to charitable purposes. We have endeavored to give to the question, that attention its importance and intricacy demands, and the more so from the fact, 'that it is claimed that this same question has been ddter mined by'the former judges of the court, as to this same title, \u25a0which decision we are asked to overrule. And while we have concluded to sustain the title of the church to this property, yet it is with a hesitation, we would not have felt, but for the decision referred to, and the very great confidence manifested by counsel opposed to its validity. We may add, however, that we have less hesitation in so holding, from the fact that counsel who claim the benefit of the former decision as authority, admit that it does not consider the real question involved as fully, if as attentively, as its character demands. In considering this decision, we first remark upon the stage of the case upon which it was made, and the ability of the church to take this property, then and now. That was a bill in chancery, filed by Marshall, one of the present defendants, against the trustees, setting forth this deed \u2014 averring that they held the land as a mere naked trust; that at the time of the execution of the deed, there was \u201c no Congregational church in Keokuk, nor any association or corporation known by such designation, nor has there been since Such conveyance, nor is there at this time, any such church, or any body or association, claiming to be such churchthat he 'had purchased the interest of certain of the heirs of McKean ; that said conveyance by McKean to the trustees, was without any consideration ; and that as there was no church or association in existence, upon which the estate could be cast, the said trustees held the same in trust for him. To this bill, there was a general demurrer, which was sustained in the District Court, but overruled in this court \u2014 and the case remanded, where it is now pending. A leading element in that case, as distinguished from this, is that by the demurrer, it was admitted that up to the time of filing the bill, there was no society or organization capable of taking the property. Nor was there anything to show that the trustees had taken possession of the land, or that the grantor had recognized, if not confirmed, the conveyance by his will. Now, the church has been organized; it is shown that the trustees did take possession of and rent the land; and that the grantor did recognize the existence and validity of the deed by his last will and testament.' The absence of all these things, evidently had much influence in the determination of the former case. Eor it is said, that \u201c had the contingency happened ; had the church been organized under the restrictions of the deed, and taken to itself the use and possession of the land during the lifetime of McKean, much weight should be given to the arguments of counsel for appellees; In such a case, although the deed in itself would be legally void, as having had no grantee, and void as creating an estate in futuro, still the doctrine of cy pres might be applied, for the purpose of carrying out the intention of the grantor, under circumstances which gave notice to the heirs, or subsequent purchasers, that such intention was manifest, not only before, but after, the contingency happened. But in this case at bar, the contingency did not happen; there was no subsequent circumstance, showing a continued intention on the part of the grantor, that his heirs should be divested of their rights, upon any contingency subsequent to his death.\u201d And while we would not say, that the absence of these circumstances, controlled the determination in that case, yet we feel justified in concluding that it had much influence, as is evident from the above, as-well as other parts of the opinion. Now, we think, and hope to be able to show, that' these circumstances have a material bearing upon the question involved; as also, that this grant can, and must be upheld, without any reference to the doctrine of cy pres. If the first part of this proposition is true, then the conclusion arrived at in this cas\u00e9, does not necessarily overrule the other.\nBut before coming to this view of the case, let us examine some other positions taken in that opinion, and upon which it appears to have been mainly based. \u201c It is obvious (says G-reen, J., in delivering that opinion), that the trustees were not vested with a freehold estate. The grantor intended to convey a legal title to them, upon certain contingencies. As trustees, the deed vested in them a contingent, naked legal title. But the use, under our statute, could only take effect upon the contingency that the cestui \u25a0que use should be organized or incorporated into existence.\u201d And again: \u201c It seems obvious that no estate was created by virtue of the deed, but a kind of remainder in futuro, to pass upon the remote possible contingency, that the trustees should continue a valid existence, and the cestui que use should be created, be properly christened and located, and endued with an orthodox spirit;\u201d and again, \u201c this cannot be regarded even as a valid remainder, for it js not supported by any vested estate of freehold. An estate vesting upon a remote contingency, is voidand finally : \u201c We conclude, then, that the conveyance cannot be sustained, even as a charitable use, because the intention of the grantor cannot be carried out consistently with the deed itself, nor with the established principles of common law. Nor can it be good as a contingent use, or a contingent remainder.\u201d Now, with all due respect, we must be allowed to say, that we are unable to see what much of the matter contained in the above; quotations, has to do with this case, or the question substantially involved. It is not denied by counsel, that this deed is sufficient, so far as the mere words of the grant are concerned, to vest in the trustees a fee simple title, nor indeed! could it well be. It is also admitted, and properly so, that, the trustees could and did take the property, if there had! been certain beneficiaries in existence capable of taking the use. How, then, can it be said that \u201c a kind of remainder was in futuro, to pass upon the remote possible contingency &c.\u201d or why the dictum, that the grant could not \u201cbe regarded* even as a valid remainder, for it is not supported by any vested estate of freehold ?\u201d What has the doctrine of contingent remainders, to do with this question ? We must confess that we are unable to see any, the remotest connection. Here the legal estate was. a unity \u2014 there was no division \u2014 - no particular'estate, for life or years, to one, and an estate to' be enjoyed in fee simple after its termination, by some other. What particular estate preceded the remainder in this case ? Or wbat remainder was there ? Take the common case of a grant to A. for life, and then to the brothers and sisters of A. This- latter estate, is called the estate in remainder.. Was there any grant to the trustees in this case, and then to the church ? Did the trustees have a particular estate carved out, with the remainder to the church ? So, also, if the trustees, by the words of the grant, took an estate in fee simple, as is admitted, how would any person claim or pretend that anything could remain ? If all was granted, hoAV could there be anything left ? Sir Wm. Blaekstone, in speaking of this estate, says that both of these interests (the particular estate, and estate in remainder), are but one estate. The present term for years, and the remainder after, when added together, being equal to one estate in fee.' They are different parts, constituting one whole, being carved out of one, and the same inheritance. They are both created, and may both subsist, at the same time, the one in possession, and the other in expectancy. 2 Bl. Com. 164. But without pursuing this inquiry further, we think we are fully justified in saying, that the church does not claim this property as the remainderman claims his estate; nor are the learning or doctrines applicable to that branch of the law, in any way connected with this case. And without other comment on specific portions of the opinion, we must sajr, that it appears to have strangely misconceived, or not to have carefully considered, the prominent and material questions involved in the case. We understand that McKean not. only intended to, but did, convey a legal title to these trustees. By the terms of the grant, however, they held the legal title in trust for the church. And the real and only question in the case is, whether under the circumstances developed, there was such a want of beneficiaries, as that upon the death of McKean, these trustees held this estate for his; heirs. And so far as. the opinion in the case, of Marshall v. Chittenden et al. (above quoted from), can be considered as, maintaining the affirmative of this proposition, we feel constrained to overrule it, \"In doing so, we are not unmindful of our duty to adhere to former decisions, and especially those made by this court, and more particularly such as may be regarded as settling and establishing rules for the alienation and, acquiring of property. Strong reasons, im deed, should be presented, before we should depart from decisions carefully considered and deliberately made. Certainty in the law is fully as much to be desired, as mere abstract perfection. In this instance, the questions involved arise for the first time in this state. The former judges of this court made a decision, and remanded the case to the court below. That case is still pending. It is not one of those cases where, for a series of years, a particular rule of property has been settled in the state, and which should not be disturbed, except for the most cogent and controlling reasons. The question is a novel one in this state. It is of the utmost importance that, at this early stage of our judicial history, we should determine it properly, if possible; and not permit a rule, hastily settled, to grow up and receive the sanction of our courts \u2014 a rule, we think, that does violence to that principle, which induces courts of chancery to give all proper encouragement and favor to charitable grants and bequests.\nWe come, then, to consider the question as though it was undecided in this state. And if this was a grant to an individual, we do not think it could be sustained. By the common law, all grants between individuals must be made to a grantee in existence, or capable of taking, otherwise there could be no such thing as livery of seizin. This rule does not apply, however, to grants or devises to charitable or benevolent purposes, and especially when the legal estate is vested in trustees, to hold for the use of the contemplated charity. In such cases, if the intent of the donor can be ascertained, and it be legal, courts of equity will carry it out. Kniskern v. Lutheran Church of St. John and St. Peters, 1 Sandf. Ch. 439; Outows v. Eslava, 9 Porter, 527; Winslow v. Cummings, 3 Cush. 358; Dickson v. Montgomery, 1 Swan, 348; Town of Pawlet v. Clark et al., 9 Cranch, 292; Burbank et al. v. Whitney, 24 Pick. 146; Zimmerman v.

Cagill, 15 Maine, 414.\nThe exercise of jurisdiction in such cases is not dependent upon the statute of 43 Elizabeth, commonly known as the statute of charitable uses. A different opinion at one time \u25a0obtained in this country, but since the decision in the celebrated case of Vidal et al. v. The Executors of Girard, 2 How. 127, it is generally conceded, that the statute of Elizabeth did not create a new law, but only regulated the jurisdiction \u2014 a jurisdiction that was before that time inherent in the court over such subjects. This question was very critically examined in that case, all the leading authorities being discussed, and the common law jurisdiction our charitable trusts \u25a0antecedent to this statute, fully recognized \u2014 the unanimous opinion of the court, being delivered by Stoky, J., who at one time entertained a contrary view. Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 1154. Numerous authorities might be adduced in support of this proposition, but the above are regarded as sufficient, especially as it is at this time, seldom if ever seriously controverted. In this country, also, this jurisdiction must be exercised judicially, and not as a prerogative power. If the intention of the donor can be legally executed, whether the gift is to a general charity, or specific object, it will be done; but if this cannot be accomplished, the claim of the heir will not be defeated, by appropriating the property to another and different object.\nThe chancellor will see that the intention of the grantor is carried out, but he will not give a different direction to the property. Though the deed may clearly manifest a benevolent or charitable disposition, it will only be executed or upheld, for the benefit of the object designed, and will not be, in favor of some other similar object. Courts in this country, in such cases, will execute the will of the benevolent donor, but cannot create an object or person, or class of persons, on whom to confer the gift. We need not add, therefore, that the doctrine of cy pres, at least in its original form, as administered in the English courts,, has no applica tion here. Carter et al. v. Balfour's Admr., 19 Ala. 821; Moore's Heirs v. Moore's Devisees, 4 Dana, 354; 4 Wheat. Appendix, note 1; Curling's Administrators v. Curling's Heirs, 8 Dana, 38. But, say counsel, this grant must be sustained on the doctrine cy pres, or must fail. We do not think that doctrine has anything to do with this case, and are clear that the property descended to the heir, if the deed is to be upheld' by that doctrine. In the first place, this is not one of those cases, which have frequently arisen, where courts have had difficulty in administering the trust or charity, because of uncertainty as to the object or beneficiary, or for want of trustees to take and hold the property. The deed is specific as to the name and location of the church \u2014 the trustees are named \u2014 they accept the trust, and undertake its execution \u2014 an'd a mode is concisely pointed out, in which the succession is to be kept up, in case of death or vacancy from any cause in said board. In this latter respect, the case is clearly different from that of Stone v. Fuller's Exe., 3 Vermt. 400. Since the organization, therefore, of the church, there can be no difficulty in carrying out the intention of the grantor, so far as any objection on the ground of uncertainty in object, is concerned. Neither are we asked, to devote the grant to an object other or different from that designed by the donor, and clearly stated in the deed thereof. We therefore run no hazard in violating his will, if the property can be given to this object. But in carrying out this will, the integrity of the law must be preserved, whatever the consequences. While courts of equity favor such grants, and will not permit the same to fail for the want of trustees, but will supply their jjlaces, and guard the execution of the trust, yet legal principles must be preserved, and the rights of parties protected. Shall the will of the donor then, be executed or carried out ? If not, why? The answer is, because no beneficiary was in esse, at the time of the grant, capable of taking. We have already shown, by reference to a number of authorities (which might be multiplied), that this is not necessary in grants of this character. But it is said, that in all these cases, as well as other similar ones, the trustees had the power to create the beneficiary\u2014 to proceed with the execution of the trust; or that if the beneficiary did not exist in an incorporated form, so as to have power as such, to acquire and hold the grant, there was at least an association or class of persons, who had- an existence ;\u2022 and further, that no case can be found similar to this, where the grant was upheld.\nIn view of these objections, let us examine some of the cases, to ascertain how far the courts of this country have gone in upholding such donations, where these and similar objections have been urged. In the case of the Town of Shapleigh v. Pillsbury, 1 Greenl. 271, the view taken of this question, will be sufficiently indicated by the following extract from the opinion by Mellen, C. J.: \u201c On these facts, it is contended by the counsel for the demandants, in the first place, that the grant by the proprietors in 1780, of the demanded premises, is void, because there was at that time, no person or persons, or corporation, capable in law of taking the estate grantedand he then proceeds to say: \u201cWe are not aware that such grants or donations were ever considered void and inoperative, either before or since the revolution, on the principle, that no person or corporation capable of taking, existed at the time of the grant.- Should such a principle be considered sufficient to defeat such grants, it would, in numberless instances, frustrate the benevolent intentions of the legislature, or of generous individuals, in the bestowment of their bounty.\u201d In Rice v. Osgood et al., 9 Mass. 38, the part material to this question, will be found in the following extracts from the opinion by Sewall, J., commencing on page 43: \u201c When the patentee, according to the condition of the grant to him, makes a grant or assignment, the estate vests, where the appropriation is to a person or corporation in esse, and is accepted by him, or them; and where contingent, and to a person or corporation not in-esse, the estate remains in the patentee, until the contingency happens, and then vests, if accepted.\u201d In this case, the grant is to trustees, who accepted at the time, and the beneficiary is now'claiming the benefit of that acceptance\nIn Curling's Administrator v. Curling's Heirs, 8 Dana, 38, the will of James Curling contained the following provision: \u201cAnd at the decease of my wife, it is my will and desire, that my negro boy Harvey shall cease from slavery, and be emancipated and set free; and that the remaining part of my estate shall be left for the use, privilege, and benefit of a public seminary; that said property shall not be sold, but rented and hired for the purpose aforesaid.\u201d The trustees of\u2019 the Trigg county seminary (where part of the testator\u2019s estate was situated), established and organized after the date of the will, were made defendants to the original bill, filed by the heirs, to have this clause in the will declared void. The devise was upheld, and this seminary, so organized, was declared to be the recipient of the testator\u2019s bounty. The-case of McGirr v. Aaron, 1 Penr. & Watts, 49, was of this character: The Bev. T. Bowers, by his will, gave certain real estate to a Boman Catholic priest, who shall succeed me in this said place, to be entailed to him and his successors, in trust, and so left by him to his successors, and so on in trust, for the use therein mentioned, in succession forever. In the course of the opinion, by Gibson, C. J., it is said, that a devise to an officiating priest and his successors, not being a corporation sole, is against the policy of the law and void, as tending to perpetuity; and' that, therefore, if this devise was to be interpreted strictly, according to the meaning of the words, it would be impossible to carry it into effect. The devise was upheld, however, and not allowed to fail for want of trustees, by holding that the devise was for the maintenance of the priest, but in care of the congregation, and consequently for its benefit alone. \u201cNow (says the court), although the congregation was not incorporated at the death of Mr. Bowers, yet, by the decisions of the court, a gift to a charity shall not fail for want of a trustee; but vest as soon as the charity acquired a capacity to take.\u201d The Town of Powlet v. D. Clark et al., 9 Cranch, 292, very fully and ably reviews the doctrine of charitable trusts, as also the rights of corporated and unincorporated ecclesiastical bodies. We can do nothing more than give a mere abstract of so much of tbe case as bears upon tbe question now before us. The case involved the construction of, and the rights of parties under, the royal charter of 1761, granted to the township of Pawlet, which gave certain lands, \u201c one share for a glebe for the church of England, as by law established; one share for the first settled minister of the gospel.\u201d There was not any church consecrated and established in Pawlet, at the time of the charter, and the inquiry arose, whether, at common law, a grant so made, was wholly void, for want of a corporation having capacity to take. Stoky, J., in delivering the opinion, says: \u201c That the land must have passed out of the donors, if at all, without a grantee, by way of public appropriation or dedication to pious uses. In this respect it would form an exception to the generality of the rule, that to make a grant valid, there must be a person in esse capable of taking it;\u201d and he concludes that, under such circumstances, until a parson could be inducted into such new church, the fee of its lands would remain in abeyance, or be like the hereditas pacens of the Eoman Colie, in expectation of an heir. This would conform exactly to the doctrine of the civil law, which as to pious donations, Bracton has not scrupled to affirm, to be the law of England. \u201c Nor (says the learned judge), is this a novel doctrine of the common law.\u201d The case of Beatty & Richie v. Kurtz et al., 2 Pet. 556, was briefly this. In 1769, Beatty and Hawkins laid out an addition to the town of Georgetown. On the recorded plan of the town, one lot was marked out, and inscribed with these words, \u201cfor the Lutheran Church.\u201d Shortly after the appropriation, the Lutherans of Georgetown proceeded to erect on this lot a log house, which was used by them as a place for public worship, and in various other ways exercised ownership over the said lot. They, however, were never incorporated as a religious society, but consisted of a mere voluntary association or society, without any formal records of their proceedings. The question arose, whether the plaintiffs, a committee chosen by this voluntary association, could, for the church, maintain its title to the lot, upon this dedication, as one made to pious uses. In reference to this question, it is said, that there was no doubt that the proprietor of the town intended that this lot should be appropriated for the use of a \u201cLutheran Church,\u201d in the town laid off by him. \u201c But as there was not, at that time, any church, either corporated or unincorporated of that denomination, in that town, there was no grantee capable of taking the same by the grant. If, therefore, it were necessary that there should be a grantee legally capable of taking, in order to support the donation in this case, it would be utterly void at law, and the land might be resumed at pleasure. If the appropriation, therefore, is to be deemed valid at all, it must be upon other principles than those which ordinarily apply between grantor and grantee; and we think, it may be supported as a dedication of a lot to a public and pious use.\u201d In Ohio, it is the settled and received law, that a dedication for public, pious, or charitable uses, requires no donee to give it effect (6 Ohio, 308; 7 Ib. 221); and to be equally well settled, that a trust shall never fail for want of a trustee, but that the necessary appointment may be made by the court. Thornhill and others v. McCandliss, 6-7 Ohio, 472.\nThe case of Winslow v. Cummings et al., 3 Cushing, 358, we think, goes further than we are called upon to go in this case. Among the legacies contained in the will of T. S. Winslow, was the following, and expressed in the following words: \u201c To the Marine Bible Society, I give one thousand dollars.\u201d There was no society of that name in existence, but at, or shortly before the time of making the will, there was a voluntary association known by the name of \u201cThe Boston Young Men\u2019s Marine Bible Society,\u201d but which, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, had been dissolved, or become extinct. The members of this society having afterwards held meetings, and claimed the legacy, their right thereto was the .question which arose for adjudication. It was held, that this society was the one intended by the testator, and that as such, it could take the legacy. \u25a0 It was objected that no such society existed at the time of making the will. \u201c As to the want of capacity to take the legacy (says the court), by reason of having no legal existence as a corporation, that can be readily supplied by the appointment of a trustee, if the object of the legacy, and the particular use to which the testator appropriated it, can-be ascertained. It seems to us that these may be ascertained, and that although this society had ceased to continue its regular organization, yet its previous existence, its well-defined objects of charity,'and mode of distribution of its funds, may be resorted to, in order to determine the purpose of this legacy, and what disposition of it will effectuate the intention of the testator.\u201d 6 Peters, 431. In The City of Cincinnati v. White, it is said, that \u201cdedications of land for public purposes, have frequently come under the consideration of this court, and the objections which have been raised against their validity, have been the want of a grantee competent to take the title, applying to them the same rule which prevails in private grants, that there must be a grkntee as well as a grantor. But that is not the light in which this court has considered such dedications for public use. The law applies to them rules adapted to the nature and circumstances of the case, and to carry into execution the intention and object of the grantor, and to secure to the public the benefit held out and expected to be derived from, and enjoyed by, the dedication;\u201d and again, that \u201cin this class of cases, there may be instances where, contrary to the general rule, a fee may remain in abeyance, until there is a grantee capabl\u00e9 of taking, when the object and purpose of the appropriation look to a future grantee, in which the fee is to vest.\u201d This case also affirms, that there is no well-founded distinction, so far as this question is concerned,- between dedications for charitable and religious uses, and those of land for the use of a city; but that all alike, form exceptions to the rule applicable to private grants, and grow out of the necessity of the case.\nIn 2 Kent\u2019s Com. (7 ed.) p. 329, in the note, we have a reference to tbe case of Milne v. Milne, 17 Louis. Ch. R. 46, where, according to the note, it was decided under the will of Alexander Milne, in which legacies were left to two pub- lie charitable asylums, to be, after the death of the testator, incorporated and established at Milneburgh, that the courts were bound to aid in carrying out the intention of the wilh See also, Executors of Burr v. Smith, 7 Vermont, 241; Ingliss v. Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 99. This last case is very much in point, but the length of this opinion forbids that we should refer to it, as its importance would otherwise demand. American Bible Society v. Wetmore, 17 Conn. 181; Zimmerman v. Anders, 6 Watts & S. 218. In note 2, to section 1190, Story\u2019s Eq. Juris., it is said that, \u201c if the object of the gift be certain, but not at present in existence, yet if its existence may be expected hereafter, the court will neither consider the gift lapsed, nor apply it to a different use,\u201d citing Aylet v. Dodd, 2 Atk. 283; Attorney-General v. Oglander, 3 Bro. Ch. 166.\nWithout referring to further cases in detail, we direct attention to the following, as throwing light upon this question : Andrew v. New York Bible Society, 4 Sandf. 178; The Zanesville Canal and Man. Co. v. McIntyre's Ex., 9 Ohio, 203; The Reformed Dutch Church v. Mott, 7 Paige, 77; Zanesville Canal and Man. Co. v. City of Zanesville, 20 Ohio, 483; Dickson v. Montgomery, 1 Swan, 348; Burbank v. Whitney, 24 Pick. 146; Porter's Case, 1 Coke, 22; Moggridge v. Thackwell, 7 Vesey, 36; Bacon\u2019s Abrig. title Charitable Uses, E; Willard\u2019s Eq. ch. 7, \u00a7 15. We1 think these cases fully sustain and uphold the following, among other propositions: That a court of equity will not permit a trust to fail for want of a trustee. That grants, devises, or dedications to public, pious, or religious uses, from the necessity of the case, form exceptions to the rule, applicable to private grants, requiring a grantee as well as a grantor. That it is not necessary, in such cases, that the beneficiary should, at the time of the grant, be clothed with the power or capacity of taking the benefit of the donor\u2019s bounty; but the intention of the donor will be executed, if this capacity arises within a reasonable time thereafter. That, in the meantime, where the property is in the hands of a trustee, and the object and purpose of the grant, look to a future grantee, it will be held in abey anee. That it is not necessary that the trustee \u00e1hall have the power to create the beneficiary, or proceed with the execution of the trust, before such creation, in order to sustain and uphold such a grant or devise; and upon .these principles, this grant may most clearly be upheld, and the intention of the grantor carried out.\nA brief reference to some other points, made by counsel, and we close this opinion. We are asked, if this grant is sustained, how this court could have ordered.its execution, if the church was not now organized? We answer, that in such a case, the grant would not have been upheld. In other words, we could not have given it to a beneficiary, that at the time of the decree, had no capacity to take. But there is a uniform current of authorities, to which there is, perhaps, but little, if any, exception, that if the church, asylum, school, or other object of the charity, shall exist'at the time of the grant in an unorganized or unincorporated form, having no capacity as such, to take or hold the property granted, yet the subsequent incorporation will prevent the legacy or grant from lapsing, and enable the court to execute the same; and yet, in such cases, there would be no more power in the court to provide for the execution of the donor\u2019s intention, before incorporating, than though the church or school did not previously exist in an unincorporated form.\nAgain, and finally, was this church endowed with the capacity to take, within such reasonable time, as to enable it to claim the benefit of McKean\u2019s bounty ? The answer to this inquiry, must always depend upon the circumstances of each case. In this instance, it is a part of the history of the times, that when the deed was made, Keokuk was, like many, if not most, of the towns of this state, just struggling into active existence. It had few inhabitants, and those belonging to the different religious denominations, were in the same proportion, few. As such, their want of ability, immediately to organize, build up, and sustain a separate church, cannot well be doubted. This grant expressly contemplates such want of means, and is designed to assist this known and appreciated poverty. It is true, the church might possibly have sooner organized, but this would have given it no greater- means, aside from the more immediate use of this grant, to have built a house of worship, or sustained a minister. The testimony shows, that there was, 'at that time, and for some years thereafter, but few members of this denomination. They attached themselves temporarily with the Presbyterians, and so continued, until having members and strength sufficient, they organized in the manner required by law, and under the peculiar government known to their own church. Under such circumstances, we should be unwilling to treat the delay as unreasonable. To so hold, would be to defeat the intentions of many benevolent individuals, designed to aid in the building up of poor and weak churches and schools, at a time in the history of all new countries, when their aid would be most needed, and accomplish the-most good. We conclude, therefore, that this case must be reversed. From the intricacy of the questions involved, we may have misapprehended the law, to the prejudice of the parties, who justly feel so great an interest in this litigation. We have endeavored to view the case in its legal aspect, influenced by- a stern sense of duty. If we h'ave erred, we have at least the reflection, that in holding as we have, we have carried out the intention of the deceased, as expressed in his deed, and re-affirmed in his will.\nDecree reversed."},{"case_name":"McManus v. Carmichael","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2270127\/","date":"1856-06-01","court":"Iowa Supreme Court","content":"Woodward, J.\nThis is the first case which has arisen in the territory, or state, of Iowa, raising the question of riparian rights on the Mississippi river; and the question whether that river is a navigable stream, in the broad sense, or only in a limited one; and whether its shores or bed, or both, belong to individuals, or to the public ? The cause might be disposed of briefly, but it calls for a somewhat free and full examination, on account of its interest and importance ; on account of the fullness with which it has been presented by counsel, arraying tbe autborities from all the states upon all sides of the questions involved; and on account of the state of the authorities; in which much has been erroneously taken for granted \u2014 a bearing given to pre viously decided cases, which they would not warrant \u2014 and unsupported inferences drawn from fair decisions.\nWe are of the opinion that the plaintiff cannot maintain his action. And in expressing our views, we will consider the following three propositions: First. Although the ebb and flow of the tide was, at common law, the most usual test of navigability, yet it was not necessarily the only one. Second. However the truth may be upon the above proposition, that test is not applicable to the Mississippi river. Third. The common law consequences of navigability, attach to the legal navigability of the Mississippi.\nFirst. Although the ebb and flow of the tide was, at com- I mon law, the most usual test of navigability, yet it was not j necessarily the only one. The term navigable embraces' within itself, not merely the idea that the waters could be navigated in fact, but also the idea of publicity, so that saying waters were public, was equivalent, in legal sense, to saying they were navigable. Yet the navigability in fact, , was the leading idea, and was the ground of their publicity. ! But on the other hand, there are in England and in this country, many arms of the sea, which, though not navigable in fact, are so legally. It is worthy of attention, that the ^ ebb and flow of the tide does not, in reality, make the wa- ; ters navigable, nor has it, in the essence of the thing, anything to do with it. The fact that certain rivers were accessible, and could be navigated by vessels of considerable bur-., den, always constituted the substance of the thing. But, as j in England, the tide waters, particularly the seas, were by fax the most important; and as all of .the rivers of that coun-' try, navigable in fact, were, affected to a greater or less ex-, tent, by the tide; and as the high and important admiralty \u2022 jurisdiction was always governed by this criterion, the ebb , and flow of the tide became the usual test. The nature of the admiralty, relating as it did, to the high seas, where the; king\u2019s authority had sole sway, and to the arms of the sea*; gave prominence to the tidal ebb and flow, in legal thought., But there is nothing in nature, or reason, to constitute this: \u25a0 the only criterion. Blanchard v. Porter, 11 O. 143; 12 How. 454.\n! In the treatise on the law of waters, by Woolrych, 40 (margin), he divides rivers into public and private. He \u00a1 says: \u201c A public navigable river frequently owes its title to : be considered as such, from time immemorial; by reason of its having been an ancient stream ; but very many acts of Parliament have been passed, to constitute those navigable rivers, which were not so before. Waters flowing inland, where the public have been used, to exercise a free right of passage, from time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary, or by virtue of legislative enactments, are public navigable rivers. This is the most unfailing test to apply, in order to ascertain a common right; others have been attempted, and frequently without success.\u201d Thus he negatives the idea that none are navigable but where the tide flows. And then he proceeds to show, that all waters are not navigable (in the legal sense) where the tide does flow; and he cites the case of The Mayor of Lynn v. Turner, Cowp. 86, in which it was contended, that a river which flows and reflows, and is an arm of the sea, is, prima facie, common to all; and therefore \u201c it, was urged that an action on the case could not be sustained against the corporation of Lynn, for the non-repair of a certain creek, because the tide of the sea had been accustomed to flow and reflow therein; consequently, it was said, this non-feasance was punishable by indictment only, because the water must be deemed public. But this argument was treated by the court as a fallacy; for they denied that the flowing or reflowing of the tide constituted a navigable stream; there being many places where the tide flows, which are not navigable; and the place in' question might be a creek in the private estate of the corporation.\u201d The language of Lord Mansfield, in that case, is emphatic: \u201cHow does it appear that this is a navigable river ? The flowing and reflowing of the tide-does not make it so,.\u201d\nIn Miles v. Rose, 5 Taunt. 706, Gibbs, C. J., says that the . flpwing of the tide, though not absolutely inconsistent with a right of private property in a creek, is strong primet facie i evidence of its being a public navigable river; and Heath, J., expresses the same opinion. And in Rex v. Montague, 4 B. & C., 598, in 1825, Bayley, J., says: \u201c The strength of this prima facie evidence must depend upon the situation and nature of the channel. If it is a broad and deep chan-i nel, calculated for the purposes of commerce, it would be; natural to conclude that it has been a public navigation \u2022- but if it is a petty stream, navigable only at certain periods \u25a0 of the tide, and then only for a very short time, and by very small boats, it is difficult to suppose that it ever has been a public navigable channel.\u201d And Holroyd and Little-dale, Justices, concur: 10 E. C. L. 414. And 'Woolrych,j again, makes the following conclusion: \u201c The circumstance,; therefore, of the flow and reflow of the tide, is one of the' strongest in support of a public right; but so far from being; conclusive, we have mentioned a case in which such a tesf has been found to be fallible. Public user, for the purposes of commerce, is, consequently, the most convincing evidenced of the existence of a navigable river,\u201d &c. It seems clear,' then, that even taking the doctrine of the English books,! whilst the flow of the tide became, and was spoken of as the usual test, yet it was not this which constituted a stream navigable, nor was it the only test; and that sometimes even this failed. See Hale\u2019s De Jure Maris, in 6 Cow. 539.\nThe soil under navigable streams belonged to the king, as parens patriae, for the same reason that the waters did; that is, as a trust for the public use and benefit, although he might.grant private rights in either the soil or the waters. This right, however, has not existed since Magna Charta. Woolrych, chap. 1 and 2: Angell on Tide Waters, 19, 67; Hale, De Jure Maris, in 6 Cowen, 539; Chapman v. Kimball 9 Conn. 38, citing Harg. Law Tracts, 12, 13, 17, 32; Constable\u2019s Cases, 5 Rep. 107; Hall v. Herbert, 3 T. R. 253; Com. Dig. tit. Navigation A. B.; The King v. Smith, Doug. 441. These authorities are cited by the court in 9 Conn, to support the proposition, that riparian proprietors, bounded on a navigable river, own the soil respectively to high-water mark, and no further. The plaintiff does not controvert this proposition. He does not claim that the common law rule applies to this river. On the contrary, he claims it does not. And it is ne\u00f3essary for him to thus hold, for if that rule is applied, it carries the riparian proprietor, Cook, usque filum aquce; and this would take the plaintiff\u2019s whole island from him. The question of the applicability of that rule, however, lies in our path, and must be determined. It is the main question in the case. But we cannot take the law upon the plaintiff\u2019s admission, and therefore must examine it.\nSecond. However the truth may be upon the first proposition, the flow and reflow of the tide is not applicable to the Mississippi, as a test of its navigability. And third: The common law consequences of navigability, attach to the legal navigability of the Mississippi river. The arguments and authorities upon these two propositions, being in a great measure identical, they must be considered together.\n| The thought has been before suggested, that as a real and jvirtual test, the tide is a merely arbitrary one, and is not 'supported by reason; since many waters where the tide t flows are not in fact navigable, and many where it does not flow, are so. It is navigability in fact, which forms the foundation for navigability in law; and from the fact follows the appropriation to public use, and hence its publicity and legal navigability. It is true, that this legality attaches to some waters which do not possess the requisite quality in fact, but this arises from their relation to1 the high seas, and to admiralty, and from the difficulty of making an hundred exceptions. It is impossible to bring the mind to an approval, when we attempt to apply to the rivers of this country, stretching up to three thousand miles of extent \u2014 flowing through or between numerous independent states \u2014 and bearing a commerce which competes with that of the oceans \u00ab \u2014 a test which might be applicable to an island not so large as some two of our states; and to streams whose utmost length was less than three hundred miles, and whose outlet and fountain, at the same time, could be within the same state jurisdiction. In England, or in Great Britain, the chief rivers are the Severn, Thames, Kent, Humber, and Mersey; the latter of which is about fifty, and the first: about three hundred miles in length, and of this (the Sev-' ern) about one hundred miles consists of the Bristol channel. The world renowned Thames, has the diminutive proportions, of two hundred miles. And of even these lengths, not the] whole is navigable. Thus, it will be seen, that these chief; rivers of good old England, range in extent with our Con- j necticut, Merrimac, Hudson, Allegany, Monongahela, Cedar,' Iowa, and Des-Moines, and bear a proportion of one to twenty, when compared with the greater rivers of this con-\u00a1 tinent. '\nOne of the counsel says he called in vain, in another cause, to learn whether the common law prevails here, and how it came. \"We will not discuss this question; but it is presumed that some system of law has place here, outside of the statutes, for they assume it. There are but two civilized systems, the civil and the common law. If the civil rules, then are these streams navigable and public, without further discussion. And if we, like the people of these states, generally, have brought the common law with us; then, too, we, like them, have brought such parts of it as are adapted to our institutions and circumstances; and we ask with confidence, whether the rules and tests which are applicable enough to the rivulets of England, shall be taken to measure those waters, whose flow is through the climates and zones of the earth ?\nThe real test of navigability here, is ascertained by use, or t by public act or declaration. We will inquire what these have been in the case of the Mississippi river. By the Spanish treaty of 1795, this river was to remain free to the subjects and citizens of the two powers, and not to others, without special cohvention. 8 U. S. St. at Large, 140. The act to enable the people of the territory of Orleans, to form a constitution and state government, 20th February, 1811, \u00a7 3, provides, that the river Mississippi, and navigable rivers and waters loading into the same, or into the gulf of Mexico, shall be common highways, and forever free, &c. 2 lb. 642. Tbe same is again declared in tbe act admitting tbe state of Louisiana into the Union, April 8, 1812 (2 lb. 703); in tbe act constituting tbe state of Mississippi, March 1, 1807 (2 lb. 349); in tbe act establishing tbe Missouri territory (2 lb. 747); and in tbe act authorizing a convention to constitute tbe state of Missouri, March 6, 1820 (2 lb. 546). We then come to tbe ordinance for tbe government of tbe northwest territory (Code of Iowa, 494), and to tbe acts relating to tbe survey and sale of tbe lands (act of May 18, 1796, 1 U. S. St. at Large, 466, 468) \u2014 the latter of which declares, that tbe navigable rivers of tbe territory shall be and remain public highways; and.- we arrive at tbe ordinances establishing tbe territories, and admitting tbe states of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. These are tbe declarations of tbe government of tbe United States. And these several laws, ordinances, and constitutions do, not only with tbe authority of law, but also with tbe force of compacts between- tbe United States and tbe several states, declare and constitute tbe Mississippi river a public highway, in tbe highest and broadest intendment possible.\nTbe acts of the United. States consist in tbe laws and practice relating to tbe survey and sale of tbe public lands. See tbe above act of May 18, 1796, &c.; also tbe laws establishing tbe general land office, and tbe regulations of that office. By these, it is well known* that tbe whole bed of navigable rivers is excepted from tbe surveys; tbe rivers are meandered, tbe lines are run, and monuments set upon the margin of the bank. Tbe amount thus made, is computed, and tbe land sold as of such quantity, and with reference to tbe plats and field notes of tbe surveys thus made. By tbe uniform practice, tbe islands in tbe rivers do not pass by grants upon tbe mainland, but are oftentimes surveyed and sold separately, and subsequently. This was tbe case with regard to tbe islands no,w in question before us.\nTbe plaintiff doef not contest tbe idea that this river is navigable in som^jpense, but bolds that it is not so in tbe common law sense) or.tbat it is not accompanied by tbe common law consequences. He claims that tbe riparian pro prietor owns to low water, and that the bed of the river below that, is in the public. The defendant, on the other hand, holds that .the proprietor owns to high-water mark only; or, in other words, to the margin of the bank, which is the same thing, in such cases. We shall hereafter have occasion to ask, by what authority or reason, we can, upon rule, throw away both the old lines \u2014 the high-water and the medium filum \u2014 and take the low-water. Some criticism has passed upon the application of the terms \u201chigh-water mark and low-water mark,\u201d to rivers above the tide. Its perfect correctness is not claimed; but it is sufficiently true, and is more expressive, than any known substitute.\nIn approaching the cases, it is to be observed, that those states which have no navigable waters other than those where the tide flows, or whose rivers are but small, and their effectual navigability is limited, or nearly so, to the tidal waters, have held more nearly to the usual common law test, and have applied the consequences as inferred at common law; whilst those states which have less relation to the salt waters, or whose rivers are larger, and depend less upon the tide waters for their navigability in fact, have been inclined to depart from the old rule.' And those cases which hold tide water to be the criterion, also treat the soil of rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, as private, notwithstanding it is considered subject to the public right of navigation, when the stream is navigable in fact.\nThe courts in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Ohio, Illinois and. Mississippi, have adopted the common law rule, with more or less directness and fullness. The cases are very fully collected by the counsel, and we have seen and examined nearly all of them. In the most of those from the northeastern states, the subject is discussed very little; but they simply assume the common law rule as the one to decide by, and look no farther. It is conceived that there is no case in the New England states, which requires comment. In New York, the subject has received a good deal of attention in the cases of Varick v. Smith, 5 Paige, 137; Same v. Same, 9 Ib. 547; Ex parte Jennings, 6 Cowen, 537, in a note to which is published a part of L. Hale\u2019s Treat. De Jure Maris ; Canal Com, v. The People, 5 Wend. 447; People v. Canal Com., 13 Ib. 358; Canal Appr's v. The People, 17 Ib. 571; Hewlett v. Pearsall, 20 Ib. 111; Pearsall v. Post, 22 Ib. 425; Canal Com. v. Kempshall, 26 Ib. 404; Gould v. Hudson R. R. R. Co., 2 Seld. 522.\nThe cases in Pennsylvania, have been cited in the books,, on both sides\u00bb of this question; but it is conceived that there has been a misapprehension of them, in citing them in favor of the old rule. Thus, the American editors of Smith\u2019s Leading -Cases, in their note to 2d vol. 193, say, that \u201c so far as the tide ebbs and flows, the ownership of the soil to low-water mark, is in the proprietor of the adjoining bank,\u201d and cite several Pennsylvania cases, among which ar\u00e9 Hart v. Hill, 1 Whart. 124; and Ball v. Slack, 2 Ib. 508. In that state, the courts have recognized the right of several fisheries, as arising from ancient custom and from statute; but they have held no doctrine of a right to low water, any farther than as rdlating to and connected with, such fishing. Thus Hart v. Hill was for a direct interruption of the right of a several fishery, and the court say, \u201c and first, a fishery is in the river, and is not the space between high and low water, though the use of that space may be necessarjr in the use of it, and may be included in the term fishery.\u201d It is true that they use general language, which implies more than this, but it is to be taken in reference to the case before them.\nIn Ball v. Slack, 2 Whart. 508, the reporter\u2019s abstract says: \u201c It seems that the owners on the Delaware and Schuylkill, have a right to the land between high and low water, subject,\u201d &c. It may be doubted whether even this, is warranted by the opinion, but admitting that it is, the law there is distinctly settled to the contrary, in Carson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475, and in Shunk v. Schuyl. Nav. Co., 14 S. & R. 71. Many inaccurate expressions have been used in the cases in that state, relating to fisheries, which have led to confusion, but the subject is much cleared in the two cases above cited. And both Pennsylvania and Connecticut recognize a right, either from statutes or local common law, to build wharves, &c., for commercial purposes. The case of Chapman v. Kimball, 9 Conn. 38, announces the rule to be, that owners on navigable rivers own to high-water mark. They say: \u201c The usage of the owners of land to high-water mark, to wharf out against their own land, has never been disputed. This is our common law.\u201d Time will not permit the examination of the remainder of the cases cited in the above note, but it is conceived, with deference, that they do not show such a rule to be established \u2014 at least outside of their own state.\nThe case of Mullanphy v. Daggett, 4 Mo. 343, is not to be cited in this class, for it stands upon the express ground, that the Spanish government granted to the water. And Browne v. Kennedy, 5 Har. & John. 195, is hardly to be ranked here, for the basis of it is the king\u2019s grant to the lord-proprietor; which the court considered as carrying the right to the shore, and which the proprietor .afterward granted away. In.the above cases, from the most of the foregoing states, the consideration arising from the common law rule, and those connected with it, to which we have before alluded, seem to have carried the minds of. the courts, as of course, for there was nothing in their circumstances to awaken the question of the applicability of the old rule. And, besides, the earlier of them set the rule down, before the development of the western country had shown the vast public importance of our greater rivers, as amounting to inland seas. It is also worthy of attention, that these same cases hold, that the rule does not extend to larger bodies of fresh and standing waters, namely, the lakes which are within the limits of New Hampshire. They carry the adjacent owner\u2019s right to the water, but not ad medium. See The State v. Gilmanton, 9 N. H. 463; Canal Comrs. v. The People, 5 Wend. 447 ; and Hale\u2019s Treat, in 6 Cow. 545, is cited.\nBut when we approach those states which, while they border upon the great western rivers, have still been held more or less by tbe common law rule, we are compelled to give very considerate attention. Tbis has been tbe case with Obio. Tbe case of Blanchard v. Collins et al., 11 Ohio, 138 (old series), in 1841, if regarded as one of tbe first settling tbis question, is certainly not a fully considered one. Tbe common law rule is at once recognized. There is not a word'in relation to tbe character of tbat river, the Ohio \u2014 \u25a0 nothing in relation to tbe ordinance of 1787, and its meaning and effect \u2014 and nothing concerning tbe laws and practice in respect to tbe survey and sale of tbe public lands. It stands chiefly on tbe two cases in New York. The People v. Platt, 17 Johns. 195, and Hooker v. Cummings, 20 Ib. 90; and its own case, Gavitt v. Chambers, 1-4, Ohio, 643. It also relies, partly, upon tbe cases of Cooper v. Smith, 9 S. & R. 26, and Shunk v. Schuylkill Nav. Co., 14 Ib. 74, which it claims to teach, tbat the riparian proprietor owns to tbe water, but not ad medium ftlum; and thus neither following tbe common law, nor wholly abrogating it, We conceive tbat tbe court gave these two cases a meaning which they do not inculcate. They will be examined hereafter.\nAll tbe cases in Obio may be influenced by tbe consideration, tbat by tbe cession of Virginia to tbe United States, by tbe compact of 1792, between tbat state and Kentucky, tbe latter owns tbe river to tbe water\u2019s edge on tbe Ohio side, and Obio owns tbe soil down to tbe water, but no part of tbe water, although slie bas a concurrent civil jurisdiction with Kentucky. Handley's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374. In tbis case \u2014 Blanchard v. Porter \u2014 tbe court considers tbe Ohio a navigable river, but not in tbe technical sense; and say, tbat \u201c grants of land bounded on rivers, or upon tbe margins of the-same, above tide water, carry tbe exclusive right of tbe grantee to low-water mark; or as some of tbe authorities say, to the centre of tbe stream. None of our rivers in tbe western country, are navigable in tbe technical acceptation of tbe term. They fall within tbe second class. Tbe distinction was originally made, in order to define tbe jurisdiction of tbe admiralty courts.\u201d Here we find it recognized, that the admiralty had much to do with the creation of the old rule; and what is the inference, when we learn that our admiralty jurisdiction extends over these very rivers. Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, 454.\nThe case of Walker & Fulton v. Board of Public. Works, 16 Ohio, 540 (old series), in 1847, is one of mandamus, under a statute, to inquire into the right to damages of proprietors on rivers, in which the state had authorized improvements. It related to the Great Miami, which had been declared navigable by statute. The court held justly, that such statutory declaration, could not take away the prior rights of riparian owners. They touch very briefly these rights \u201c in the streams within our borders, which are in fact navigable,\u201d and say, that the question is not new in that state, having been repeatedly before that court, and that the rule is, that the riparian proprietor owns to the eentre, or the \u201c entire river,\u201d if he owns land on both banks. This manifestly is restricted to the streams strictly within their borders. Otherwise, it contradicts the other decisions. And this leaves out the Ohio and the Wabash. Stinson v. Butler, 4 Black. 285, considers the English rule as to high-water mark, as applicable to waters which ebb and flow, and curtly holds, that grants by the United States of lands on the Indiana side of the Ohio, extend to low water, and seems to infer it from the fact that the state boundary goes there; and this is the only reason intimated. If the state boundary had gone to the centre, would the grant have reached it? If this is the argument, it conflicts with almost all on the same side of the general question.\nThe case of Middleton v. Pritchard, 3 Scam. 510, goes further,, and is one of the strongest of the western cases. It was trespass for cutting trees. The plaintiff bought of the United States the fractional southeast quarter of S. 13, T. 5, N. R. 10, W,, of 3 P. M., in Illinois, containing 32.74 acres. In front of it, in the river, within his lines if extended, is an island, probably containing nearly the same quantity, separated from the main land by a slough or bayou, which was covered by water only a smaller part of tbe year, and tbe remainder of the time is uncovered, and grass grows there. There is a distinct bank and shore on the margin of this fractional section, and the survey was along the bank, the island not having been surveyed. The court held, that the plaintiff, by his purchase, took the island, but it is not clear whether they considered him as going to low water only, or to the middle of the river. The dissenting opinion of Wilson, C. J., rather indicates the latter, and there is no reasoning which negatives it, whilst the reasoning upon the common law rule, if carried out, would take the plaintiff to the. centre. There are two points, upon which the court departs from the mass of cases; first, it applies to the grant of' the government, the rule of private grantors, namely, that the grant is to be taken most strongly against the grantor; and then assuming that it is a grant, bounded by the river, they apply the other rule, that it extends to the centre, unless expressly negatived. Second: it rejects the surveys, field notes, &c., as constituting any part of the description or limitation, and say these are only for computation, and to arrive at the price. Now, we conceive, that the rule of -a grant being construed most strongly against the grantor, does not apply to public grants; but that the government, being but a trustee for the public, its grants are to be construed strictly. Varick v. Smith, 9 Paige, 547; Canal Comm'rs v. People, 5 Wend. 444, 460, 464; Same v. Same, 17 Wend. 574, note, 612; La Plaisance Bay v. Monroe., Watkins\u2019 Ch. 155; Charles R. Bridge v. Warren, 11 Pet. 544; Stonebridge Canal v. Wheeley, 2 Barn. & Add. 792. And we had supposed that the grants of land by the United States, in their patents, had relation to the surveys, plats, and field notes. Jackson v. Freer, 17 Johns. 28; La Plaisance Bay v. Monroe, Walk. Ch. 155; Chinoweth v. Les. of Haskell, 3 Pet, 96; McIver v. Walker, 4 Wheat. 447; Pearsall v. Post, 20 Wend. 116; Rowan's Ex'rs v. Portland, 8 B. Mon. 232; 17 M. 207; 9 Watts, 117; 2 Cart. 278; 7 Johns. 222.\nBut the chie ustice, Wilson, differed from the conclu\u00ed \u25a0\u25a0sion of the majority of the court in. the above case. He dissented from the application of the above rule to public grants; and we think his opinion more harmonious in its course of thought, with the train of legal reasoning generally. It would be gratifying to quote a larger portion of his remarks, but a few brief passages must suffice. He objects a want of authority in the agents of the government to sell, thus: \u201c The land authorized to be sold,\u201d he says, \u201c and the mode of selling it, are prescribed by law, and all sales in violation of that are void.\u201d \u201c These surveys and plats are the guides of the land officers in making their sales; they have no authority to sell a single acre that has not been surveyed. Every tract of land liable to sale, is specifically described,\u201d &c. \u201cItfollows, therefore, as a necessary consequence, that islands, as well as other lands, that have not been surveyed and platted-as the law requires, cannot be sold. It has no description known to the law.\u201d And he argues that neither the government nor purchasers, understand or intend that-islands pass by a sale of lands on the nearest shore. '\nMorgan & Harrisson v. Reading, 3 Sm. &-M. 366-395, in 1844. This case was very completely argued, and we cannot say but that it was deliberately considered. It takes the English rule as the test, and applies it in the legitimate, logical consequences, and gives the riparian proprietor ad medium jilum aguce of the Mississippi river.\nIf we were called upon to illustrate the impropriety of applying the English rule to this and other great rivers, we would cite the above case from Mississippi, and that of Mullanphy v. Daggett, 4 Mo. 343.\nIt is impossible to define beforehand, all the fair uses to which the navigators of these publie rivers may have occasion to appropriate their shores. But let us take these two cases as examples. The above case from Mississippi shows, that the plaintiff was the owner of a certain' lot in the city of Yicksburg, which lot the court held to extend to the middle of the river. The defendants were \u201c citizens of Ohio, and regular flat boat traders.\u201d They landed their boat op posite the city, at the shore, and opposite the plaintiff\u2019s lot, and used the shore to tie the boat to, and land their goods upon, They remained there some time, and plaintiff charged them a rent of one dollar a day, which they refused to pay. The court held them liable. Now, is not this repulsive to all our ideas of the objects, uses, and appropriations of this great river? If it is said that they remained a long time (four months), let it be remembered that this is not the point of the case, and that it does not change the argument. If there is any weight in that fact, the answer is, that the landing should be placed under the authority of the city, and let that regulate such matters, and then the matter would fall under a different train of reasoning. The case of Mullanphy v. Daggett, 4 Mo. 343, w.as decided upon the Spanish lawg and,the king\u2019s special grant. But let us look at it in the light of that of Morgan et al v. Beading. The defendants hauled up their steamboat, for repairs, on the shore of the river. They remained there some six weeks, and erected a temporary blacksmith\u2019s shop, for the purposes of their work. What can be conceived of, as a more legitimate use of the shore of a great navigable river ? It is said that they might go to some town or city, which has docks or ways, or other facilities for such purposes. Suppose the accident to occur far from, such a place, and the operation to be impracticable, and then how many such places are there on our waters t The very question is, are they compelled to do go? Such arguments assume the practicableness of such a course; they take for granted the practical convenience \u2014 a matter which is generally desirable in such cases, for convenience and interest commonly lead to that course, when practicable. Are these rivers public and free to run your boat or vessel, and not public and free to stop when you are disabled? A restricted construction of the rights of navigation in these waters, reducing them to a petty sufferance, is greatly to be deprecated.\nBefore coming to the case where the common law rule'is get aside directly, it seems desirable to look a little more closely at two or three of those in which the old rule is adhered to, for in them we can readily perceive, that the adoption of the former rule was for a time doubtful; that it is to a limited extent only, that it is followed; and that the same courts would have probably decided differently, had they been adjudicating upon our rivers.\nIt is important -to remember, that in very few of the cases in the northeastern states, has the question been opened up at all considerably; but in nearly all of the older ones, the wheels run into the old ruts, as a matter of course, rather than from a deliberate choice of ways, in the same manner that they generally do, unless something arises to start the attention anew. They first drew a line of distinction between streams and standing water, and refused the application to lakes or other large bodies of like waters, thus making a criterion about as important, in view of the real nature of the case, as the ebb and flow of the tide, or the saltness of the water. Thus, in New Hampshire and New York, the rule was withheld from the small lakes in their interiors, as well as from the larger ones on their borders. But, how-ever it may have begun, the rule having been settled, and rights of property having grown up under it, and there being in this case, no strong reaspn for a change, it still and very properly remains. In The Canal Commissioners v. The People, 5 Wend. 423, Chancellor Walworth says: \u201cThe principle itself does not appear to be sufficiently broad to embrace our large fresh water, lakes or inland seas, which are wholly unprovided for by the common law of England.\u2019'\u2019 \u201cIt is not necessary to express an opinion,\u201d he says, \u201c whether this principle can be properly applied to spine part of those streams which are navigable from the sea, by large ships and vessels, far above the influence of the tides, as that question can never arise in this state, We have no such rivers.\u201d Surely, such an .expression leaves u$, who have such rivers, free to discuss the -question anew, and. without feeling constrained by those decisions. Again, hp says: \u201cThe rivers in England aboye tide, in point of fact, are not navigable, except for small craft; reasons, therefore, east in that island, for the common law rule, which have no existence in this country. It is contrary to fact, to assert that our immense fresh water rivers are not navigable; and it is matter of just exultation, as well as benefit, to the country, that in the United States we have rivers which above tide, are navigable to a greater extent than would be the circumnavigation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It is therefore preposterous to contend, that the limited doctrines of the common law are applicable to the Mississippi, Ohio, Susquehanna, Niagara, and St. Lawrence. If applicable, the owners of land on these streams have a right to go to the centre of the rivers, and Grand Island, in the Niagara, with 18,000 acres, would belong to the owners of the shore.\u201d\nThe same case -was again before the Court of Errors, under the name of The Canal Appraisers v. The People, 17 Wend. 571. In an abstract of the conclusions to which the senators delivering opinions arrived, Chancellor Walworth\u2019s sixth proposition, is, that it is conceded that the common law rule does not apply to large navigable lakes, nor to rivers constituting the boundaries between that and other states. The third proposition of Senator Beardsley, is that the common law rule, which authorizes the owners of the shores of rivers in which the tide does not ebb and flow, to hold ad filurn aquae, is not applicable to the condition of that state (New York), in respect to its large navigable rivers, in which no tide ebbs or flows; that from the acts of the government of New York, as well before as since the Revolution, in asserting the title of the public to islands and the beds of rivers, after granting the lands upon the shores of navigable rivers in which the tide does not ebb or flow, a strong presumption is raised that the common law, in this respect, has never been adopted there. The first proposition of Senator Tracy (president of the Senate), is, that the great fresh water streams of this country are not subject to the principle of individual appropriation, allowed by the common law of England; and his third is, that the reason of the rule, assigning the proprietorship of the bed of a river to the owners of the adjacent shores, wholly fails in refer ence to the large navigable rivers of this country. And fourth, that the long continued practice of granting islands in rivers, subsequent to patents covering the adjacent shores, contradicts the assumed application of the common law rule of riparian ownership, as applied to the great rivers of that state. The chancellor, who is in favor of applying the common law rule as far as practicable, says, in his opinion: \u201c Considered in this light, is there any possible objection to the common law rul\u00e9, even in regard to our largest rivers, which are wholly within this state, and above tide water? A different rule must probably prevail as to our large navigable lakes,'* which are mere inland seas, although there is neither ebb nor reflux of the tide; and also as to those lakes and streams which form the natural boundaries between us and a foreign nation.\u201d In this case, the surveyor-general of the state gave testimony, and in reference to it, and in allusion to the description in the grant, the chancellor makes a remark pertinent to the present surveys -and sales. He says, the patent itself contains. only the number of the lot, but that the survey and field notes in his office, contain a particular description of the boundaries; that where such lots are situated on the banks of navigable rivers, they are bounded on the banks of such rivers or streams, and run thence along the bank of such stream. This is a clear indication of the intention of the grantors, that the patent should not include any part of the alveus (or bed) of the stream, or of the islands therein. It is therefore a limited grant, and it cannot be extended to the thread of the stream, nor include any island therein, even on common law principles, especially when we take into consideration, that by a law of the state, the patentee was entitled to only a certain number of acres.\u201d Senator' Beardsley also, in his opinion, comments on the practice of the state in granting the islands separately 'from the main land, although the grants were in the terms bounded on the bank, and thence down along said river,\u201d which at common law would have extended the grants to the thread of the stream; and considers this as an evidence that the common law rule of. fresh water rivers, had not been regarded as applying to the Mohawk, the river under consideration. On page 616, he says: \u201cHere allow me to inquire, what good reason can be urged in favor of applying these principles to our large American rivers, and thus keeping up a distinction in name, where in reason and good sense, none should exist. Why, for instance, should proprietors of land on the Mississippi, where the tide ebbs and flows, be restricted to the bank of the river, and that part only be called navigable; and those proprietors of lands immediately above the flow of the tide, be suffered to go to the eentre of the stream, when the river in point of fact, is actually navigable for thousands of miles above tidewater. Yet such are the absurdities of the common law, when applied to our large rivers. In England, this rule is very proper in reference to small rivers, and is calculated to prevent litigation, &c. But in respect to our large rivers, there does not appear to be any propriety in the rule; and if in England and in this country, it is essential to the public interest, to declare that arms of the sea, bays and rivers where the tide flows, belong to the state or nation, it is equally important that the same rule should prevail in respect to our large rivers, where the tide does not flow.\u201d In the same case, Canal Appraisers v. People, 19 NEend. 621, President Tracy says: \u201cIt is impossible for me to believe it reasonable or right, that the great fresh water streams of this country ever were or should be subject to those narrow principles of individual appropriation, which might fitly enough apply to the comparatively insignificant water courses which are found in England; and even in that part of the European continent where the civil law originated.\u201d \u201c It is utterly incredible that when they (the colonists) surveyed the magnificent rivers, which a bountiful providence has provided, they could imagine that gifts, which from their very nature and extent were capable, not only of being enjoyed by all,' but of supplying the wants of all, should by a misapplication of a principle utterly unsuited to the subject to which it was applied, be made the exclusive property of a few; in short, that because the common law had assigned the ownership of a petty streamlet in England to its riparian proprietors, therefore, unlooked for by themselves, the first settlers on the banks of the magnificent rivers of this country, had acquired an exclusive right to the broad channels through which those rivers flowed.\" He then adverts to the practice of the state in granting islands separately from, and subsequently to, the grant of the main land, as negativing the idea that the bed is private, and concludes thus: \u201c Ought we, then, in the face of this long continued practice, and unconstrained by any direct authority, either legislative or judicial, to close our eyes to the condition of things which surround us \u2014 the expanse of this continent \u2014 the copiousness of its waters \u2014 -the improvements, intelligence and wants of this age? On such a subject as this, even admitting the facts to be obscure or equivocal, and the law to be unsettled, is it' wise for us to disregard the dictates of enlightened reason,, the suggestions of public policy, and the irresistible progres-, sion of liberal principles, resulting from the physical and intellectual advancement of mankind; and turning backward, to resort to the circumscribed views of a less enlightened; age, for a narrow, insular, and inadequate rule, by which to* measure the flow of our jurisprudence?\u201d\nHad these jurists been hearing the cause at bar, they could not have expressed sentiments more pertinent.\u201d Their thoughts we adopt, and make them our own, and we quote them freely, rather than merely express the views as of ourselves, that it may be seen that other judges, in other parts, and of more learning and ability, have entertained them, and therefore they are not novelties; and also that it may appear that the old common law rule has but a weak hold on the country, and is by no means dominant, but that $11 things combine for the rejection of its confining influence.\nIn accordance with this general and strong tendency, several states have refused to apply the narrow rule to their large waters. As earjy\u2019as 1810, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Carson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475; took the lead. The case came up upon exceptions taken to a charge to a jury by Chief Justice Tilghman, concerning a right of fishing. He said: \u201c The several acts of assembly declaring these rivers to be highways, and regulating the fisheries in them, are incompatible with the common law right. But the common law principle concerning rivers, even if extended to America, would not apply to such a river as the Susquehannah, which is a mile wide, and runs several hundred miles, through a rich country, and which is navigable, and is actually navigated by large boats. If such a river had existed in England, no such law would have ever been applied to it. Their streams, in which the tide does not ebb and flow, are small.\u201d It appears from the opinion of Brackenbedge, J., that the grants sometimes extended to the water, and called for it, and even where they did so, they were held not to go to the middle of the stream; nor did they go to the water, unless the grant was explicit.\nThis case was followed by Skunk v. Schuylkill Nav. Co., 14 S. & R. 71, in 1826; Bird v. Smith, 8 Watts, 484; Union Canal Co. v. Landis, 9 Watts, 228, in 1840; all of which recognize the same doctrine. There does not seem to have been advanced in Pennsylvania, a claim to the centre of these large rivers, nor even to the shore. Two of the above cases, arise on claims to the exclusive right to fish with seines in the pools made or kept in order by individuals, founded upon a supposed ancient usage. But the claim of such a right was rejected.\nNorth Carolina, also, in 1828, set aside the common law . rule, as inapplicable. And the only thing which gives the riparian owner, in that state, a right down to the water, is the express declaration of their ancient acts of 1715 (or 1765) and 1777, relating to surveys and sales; and their otherwise total exemption from the common law private rights, stands upon the ground that they are declared to be highways, as the acts and laws of the United States have declared other rivers. Tennessee follows the decision in North Carolina, as subject to the same acts of assembly.\nIn the case of Cates v. Wadlington, 1 McCord, 583 (356 top), in 1822, the Supreme Court of South Carolina, by Nott, J., says, \u201c But that rule (the common law) will not do in this state, where onr rivers are navigable several hundred miles above the flowing of the tide.\" And they say this in close connection with the assertion, that there is no legislative act declaring which, or whether any, of their rivers are to be considered as public or navigable, so that the subject was free from any kind of constraint, except the common law rule.\nThe subject received more- elaborate attention in The Mayor, &c., of Mobile v. Eslava, 9 Porter, 578, in 1840, than in nearly any of the other causes; and it is here viewed with more reference to the ordinances and laws of the United States, which are scarcely alluded to in any one of the foregoing cases, but without which, we conceive it impossible to reach the merits of the question. The common law rule alone seems to have absorbed the attention, in the consideration of the cases, whilst the treaties, ordinances and laws of the United States, have been overlooked or passed by in silence.\nThe United States provided that the navigable waters within the state of Alabama, should forever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said state and of the United States, &c., in like manner as in the ordinances relating to all the other new states. The court, in the above' cause, arrive at the following conclusions:\n1. The navigable waters within the state have been dedicated to the use of the citizens of the United States, so that it is not competent for Congress to grant a right of property in the same.\n2. The navigable -waters extend not only to low water, but embrace all the soil that is within the limits of high-water mark.\n8. By the acts of Congress regulating the survey and disposal of the public lands, the federal government has renounced the title to the navigable waters and the soil covered by them.\n4. That, as the original states are entitled to the right of property in the navigable waters within their territory, so Alabama, being admitted into the Union on an equal foot ing with the original states, is, of. consequence, entitled to the s|me property in her navigable waters, and the soil under them.\n5. By the admission of Alabama info the Union, without \u00e1 reservation of the right of property in the navigable waters, the state succeeded to all the right of the United States, except so far as it was reserved by the federal constitution, in some of its grants, or its retention was necessary to enable the federal government to exercise its delegate powers.\nIn the opinion of the court, they hold the following language : \u201c The several acts of Congress regulating the survey of the public lands, all provide for the surveys which border on navigable streams, to be'so made.as not to include within their lines any part of the shore. 1st Yol. Land Laws (ed. 1838) 50, 96,104,191.\u201d And again; \u201cWe find it'is also enacted, in the territorial ordinance, and the laws regulating the survey and sale of lands in Mississippi and Alabama, that the navigable waters shall be and remain public highways. Here were express avowals by Congress, that they should not be surveyed and sold, but should be withdrawn from commerce.\u201d \u201cIt is then considered clear, that the navigable waters of this state have been dedicated to the common \u00fase of the people of the United States; but perhaps it may be considered as questionable, what extent of soil is embraced by the dedication. We .think it must be so much ground as is covered with the water, not only at low, but at high tide. The government surveys extend thus far, and the shore is regarded rather as a part of the water, than as land. It is believed that there is no instance in which the United States, after having sold the land to high water, has afterwards asserted a right to dispose of the space between that and low-water mark.\u201d The land in question in the above cause, is adjacent to the city of Mobile, in the Mobile river. That the tide flows there, we infer, but this fact is barely alluded to incidentally. It does not form the ground for any of the reasoning of the court, nor the turning point for any of its conclusions. The whole case, with all the views of the court, is as appropriate to the Mississippi river, along the borders of Iowa, as to tbe Mobile in Alabama. Here alone, and for tbe first time, bas tbe proper force been given to tbe repeated dedications of navigable waters to tbe public of tbe United-States. And it seems utterly inconsistent with these acts of dedication, and with tbe laws, to give' tbe public only a qualified, partial, restricted use \u2014 a mere easement over tbe waters. See 16 Pet. 235-247; Polland's Lessee v. Files, 2 How. 592.\nTbe case of La Plaisance Bay Harbor Co. v. City of Monroe, in Michigan, Walker\u2019s Cb. 155-168, in 1843, bolds tbe same doctrine. Tbe language of tbe court is: \u201c The complainants do not own either tbe bed or tbe banks of tbe river below tbe point of obstruction. Tbe bed of tbe stream is public property, and belongs to tbe state. Tbis is tbe case with all meandered streams, no part of them being included in tbe original survey; and tbe common law doctrine of usque ad filum aquae, is not applicable to them. Tbe public owns tbe bed of tbis class of rivers, and is not limited in its right Jp an easement, or right of way only. So with regard to our 'large lakes, or such parts of them, \u00e1s lie within tbe limits of tbe state.\u201d\nProbably all of tbe cases from tbe state courts upon tbis subject, have been referred to by tbe counsel, whose industry bas opened tbe cause-to a free examination; and all of a leading character, so far as we have been able to obtain them, have been examined. It is now necessary to see bow far tbe matter bas been discussed or settled by tbe federal courts.\nTyler v. Wilkinson, 4 Mason, 397\u2014400, related to tbe Pawtucket river, a small river flowing in part of its course between Massachusetts and Rhode Island; but tbe controversy was between individuals. Judge Story, without any discussion, assumes tbe application of the common law rule to that part of it which was above the tide water.\n.Bowman's Devisees and Burnly v. Wathen et cd., 2 McLean, 376, is cited on both sides of the question, but we think it a strong authority against tbe application of tbe common law rule. Judge McLean says: \u201cWe apprehend that tbe common law doctrine as to the navigableness of streams, can have no application in this country; and that the fact of navigableness does in no respect depend upon the ebb or flow of the tide. On navigable streams, the riparian right, we suppose, cannot generally extend beyond high-water mark.\u201d The doubt as to the application of this case, as an authority, arises on the next passage, in which he says, \u201c But in the present case, this inquiry is not important. It is enough to know that the riparian right on the Ohio river extends to the water,\u201d and that \u201c the proprietor has the right of fishing, of ferry, and every other right which is properly appurtenant to the soil.\u201d The doubt is, whether the learned judge means this latter as a projrosition holding true of the Ohio generally, or of grants standing, as the one before him did. He may have intended it of'the Ohio generally, upon the strength of the cases before cited from that state; but strong against this construction, is the assertion that the proprietor has the right of fishing! Now, no one has ever gone so far as to claim a several fishery in that, or any other of the great western rivers; and the Ohio cases, as well as Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374, negative such a right; for they hold that as the state of Ohio extends to low-water mark only, of consequence no grant by, or in, the state, can extend farther; and the right of a several fishery implies, ex necessitate, a title or right usque filum aquce, There is a view which'renders Judge McLean\u2019s remarks entirely harmonious; that is, considering his last remark as made in reference to the right or title before him. Eor, directly,-in connection with the foregoing thought, he proceeds thus: \u201c In coming to this conclusion, we have deemed it unnecessary to look particularly into the laws of Yirginia, under which the title in question was derived,\u201d &c. \u201c The title of Isaac Bowman (one of the complainants) was derived from the state of Yirginia, not only before Indiana was known as a territory, -but before the organization of the Northwestern Territory. His rights, whatever they were, can have been in no respect affected by the direct act of the territorial government, or of the state government which succeeded it.\u201d On page 377, in the statement of facts, is the following, which forms the basis of the case. The complainants claim under Isaac Bowman. \u201c Bowman was attached to the regiment commanded by George Rogers Clark, and to whom the state of Yirginia granted 150,000 acres of land, lying northwest of the river Ohio. In the cession of lands to the United States, north of the Ohio river, by the state of Yirginia, this tract was reserved.\u201d Now it is difficult to apply Justice McLean\u2019s remarks to aught but this title and this state of things; and so viewing it, the case remains as one against the application of the common law rule even to the Ohio river. And if it is not to be so regarded, the case is still one against such application to any other of the great streams. The case of Handly\u2019s Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 376, teaches nothing on the question before us. It was ejectment in the federal court in Kentucky, for land claimed by the plaintiff under a grant from the state of Kentucky, and which the defendant claimed under a grant from the United States, as being a part of Indiana. It was a piece of land near or on the Indiana shore, which was an island when>the water was at a full or middling flow, but was left connected with the Indiana shore at low water. Chief Justice Marshall said: \u201c The title depends upon the question whether the lands lie in the state of Kentucky, or in the state of Indiana,\u201d and the court held, that the state of Kentucky extended to low-water mark only, on the western or northwestern side of the Ohio. This was by virtue of the cession from Yirginia to the United States.\nThe cases of The City of Cincinnati v. White, 6 Pet. 432 ; Barclay v. Howell\u2019s Lessee, 6 Pet. 499; The City of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662, which have been cited) afford us no specific assistance. But time will not permit us to examine them.\nThe case of Pollard\u2019s Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 213, however, does contribute to our views, in that it holds that, \u201cthe shores of navigable waters, and the soils under them, were not granted by the constitution of the United States, but were reserved to the states respectively; and the new states have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction over this subject, as the original states.\u201d And McKinley, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, page 229: \u201c Then to Alabama belong the navigable waters and the soils under them, in controversy in this case, subject to the rights surrendered by the constitution to the United States.\u201d And again, page 280: \u201c To give to the United States the right to transfer to a citizen, the title to the shores and the soils under the navigable waters, would be placing in their hands a weapon, which might be \u00abwielded greatly to the injury of state sovereignty, and deprive the state of the power to exercise a numerous and important class of police powers.\u201d The above cause is re-examined and affirmed in Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 How. 471, where it is again held, that the title to the soil below high-water mark, in navigable waters, is in the state.\nThe case of Howard, v. Ingersoll et al., 18 How. 381, does not bear upon the present question. The plaintiff\u2019s land had \u201c for its eastern boundary the state of Georgia,\u201d as the bill of exceptions reads, And Wayne, J., in the opinion, says, \u201c The point for decision is one of boundary between the states of .Georgia and Alabama.\u201d It related to the river Chattahoochee, which is believed not to be navigable in any sense in that part. At least, the question of its navigability-does not enter into the case at all.\n,We desire to add a passage from the opinion of Chief Justice, Taney, in the case of the Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 448, in 1851, in which case was considered the question of the extension of the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States to navigable waters, other'than the tide waters. \u201cNow there is nothing,\u201d he.says, \u201cin the ebb and flow of the tide, that makes the waters peculiarly suitable for admiralty jurisdiction, nor anything in the absence of a tide, that renders it unfit. If it is a public navigable water, on which commerce is carried on between different states or nations, the. reason for the jurisdiction is precisely the same; and if a distinction is made on that account, it is merely arbitrary, without any foundation in rea son; and, indeed, would seem to be inconsistent with it. In England, the writers and courts always speak of the jurisdiction as confined to tide water. And this definition, in England, was a- sound and reasonable one, because there was no navigable stream in the country, beyond the ebb and flow of the tide, nor any place where a port could be established to carry on trade with a foreign nation, and.where vessels could enter or depart with cargoes. In England, therefore, tide water and navigable water, are synonymous terms, and tide water, with a few small and unimportant exceptions, meant nothing more than public rivers, as contra-distinguished from private ones; and they took the ebb and flow of the tide as the test, because it was a convenient one, and more 'easily determined the character of the river. At the time of the adoption' of our constitution, the English definition was equally proper here. In the old thirteen states, the far greater part of the navigable waters are tide waters, &c. * * * * The courts of the United States,, therefore, naturally adopted the English mode of defining a public river, and consequently the boundary of admiralty jurisdiction. They measured it by tide water. And that definition, having found its way into our courts, became, after a time, a familiar mode of describing a public river, and was. repeated as cases occurred, without particularly examining \u25a0whether it was as universally applicable in this country as in England. If there were no waters in the United States which are public, as contradistinguished from private, except where there is tide, then unquestionably, here as well as in England, tide water must be the \u2018limit of admiralty power. And as the English definition was adopted in our courts, and constantly used in judicial proceedings, and forms of pleading, borrowed from England, the public character of the river was in process of time lost sight of, and the jurisdiction of the admiralty treated as if it were limited by the tide. The description of a public navigable river, was substituted in place of the thing intended to be described. And under the natural influence of precedents and established forms, a definition, originally correct, was adhered to and acted on, after it had ceased, from a change of circumstances, to be the true description of public waters.\u201d\nThis large portion of attention has been given to the subject, from a conviction that the common' law rule is not applicable to the Mississippi river; and because the subject has not been discussed as it should be; the courts assuming the old rule, in many cases, sub silentio. By thus reviewing it, we trust that it has been made manifest that less weight is to be given to the old rule, than the mind would, at first, suppose, and that the way has been opening for its entire rejection from the noble waters of the west. It cannot be doubted, that by the common law, the riparian proprietor on navigable waters owned to highwater mark only. 2 \u2019Woolrych on W., 40-44; Angell on T. W., 22-24; Chapman v. Kimball, 9 Conn. 40, and authorities cited on 38.\nWhat, now, is to carry us down to low water ? The plaintiff himself holds, that the common law rule is not applicable in its whole extent. And well he does so, for it would take away his island. But why shall we go to low water ? Is this common law ? and if it is not, what law is it ? It is apprehended that there is no such rule or principle, and that the instances where such a rule was adopted, were dependent on certain local circumstances. Chapman v. Kimball, 9 Conn. 38, stands upon a local common law or usage. The court announces the rule to be, that owners on navigable rivers own to high water, and no further; and that their local common law gave a right to build wharves, &c. In North Carolina and Tennessee, the statute makes this the line. Blanchard v. Collins, 11 O. 138, as well as the case in Indiana, was probably influenced by the fact, that that line was the bound of the state, as one of the cases intimates; and beyond question, Howard v. Ingersoll, 13 How. 381, was influenced by a similar fact; that is, by the line between Georgia and Alabama, which places the party\u2019s bound on the top of the bank of the Chattahoochee.\nOne or two cases must be noticed, in order to show that they have not been overlooked. Emans v. Turnbull, 2 Johns. 313, is probably substantially answered by the doc trine in Gould v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 2 Seld. 522, which, holds that the riparian owner on the Hudson river, has no property in the shore between high and low water, entitling him to compensation when the state authorized the company to construct a road along the shore. And though the answer should not be deemed complete, still the former case could not be permitted to control the conclusion in the present one.\nThe case of Blundell v. Catterall, 5 B. & Ald. 268 (7 E. C. L. R. 91), cannot be passed in silence. It is a strange case, and much more, it is conceived, has been made of it than it warrants. All that was decided upon the question of the common law right, was clearly extra-judicial, and it sets up a doctrine which probably would not be listened to in this country; that is, that there is no common law right to bathe in the sea! The case is doubted and dissented from in many others, and an English writer, Hall, in his treatise on the rights of the crown, &c., finds much fault with it. The case finds that the lord of the manor, was the owner of the shore down to low water, and therefore it was, that the defendant had not the right to go over the shore with horses and carriages, and bathing machines, to the shore, for the purpose of bathing; and the judges in their several opinions, say that this is the only question, yet they go on to decide a much broader one, which was not involved. In its fullest extent, it does not help us to a conclusion on the present question. It would be extremely ungrateful to be obliged to determine a question of so much consequence as the one before us, upon the unreasoned, imperfect, and merely local views of some of the eastern cases, and upon what are no more than obita dicta. The only two cases relating to our large rivers, which seem to stand upon the common law rule, are Middleton v. Pritchard, 3 Scam. 510, and Morgan v. Reading, 3 S. & M. 366, which have the merit of carrying out the common law rule consistently, and not breaking it to pieces, and making a new one.\nAlthough it should be that we have erred in the views taken of the foregoing cases, still we feel constrained to think, that in all that has been done in relation to this great river, it was intended to set it free from all trammels and technicalities, and to. make it a highway, and public, in a sense correspondent with the magnitude of the stream, and of the public interests therein. And all the reasoning which drives back the private owner from the middle of the stream, and demands an absolutely public water and. bed to low water, demands the same, precisely, up to high water. It is difficult in the extreme, to find the reasoning, if such there be, which departs from the common law rule as to the thread of the stream, and then stops at low water. The common law knows but two lines, the filum aquce, and high water. If the stream be navigable, the owner\u2019s bound is the one; if not navigable, his bound is the other; and although there is some naked authority in favor of dividing betweeti them, there is none based upon legal rule or reasoning. By this review, it is perceived, that force and effect is to be given to various facts, circumstances, and considerations, which are scarcely alluded to in some of the cases, and which have no place at all in the older and eastern cases; such are the treaties, compacts, ordinances, and constitutions; the laws relative to the survey and sale o the public lands; the declaration that these rivers shall forever remain highways, free to all citizens, &c. Aud we find that the fact of the government selling islands separate from, and independent of\u00a1 the mainland, had its weight at an early stage of the argument, in Pennsylvania, and even in New York. The fact, also, that the Mississippi river is the boundary between numerous, independent states, is of great importance, as we have found the oases recognizing.the idea, that where a river is the boundary between nations and states, the common law rule does not apply. All these, and such Considerations, formed absolutely no part of the older cases, and enter much less into some of the later ones, than they should. But, under these views, and with a thought of how the terms \u201cpublic highway\u201d and \u201cnavigable,\u201d are a hundred times used in relation to these rivers, how is it poa sible to clothe them with the narrow, straightening garments\" of a technical-reasoning?\n\"When the Mississippi river was declared a public highway, in the solemn instruments before referred to, it was not in any technical sense, but in a high, broad, and free understanding ; and it was placed upon the same ground with a river navigable at common law. And as we cannot take the medium filum as our line, we think we are obeying the settled rules of law, in considering the stream as declared a navigable river in the legal sense, and as subject to the consequences which attach to such waters at common law. The conclusion, therefore, is that plaintiff has not a title to the land between high and low water, so as to enable him to maintain this action for taking the sand. This opinion need not preclude the idea, that the adjacent owner may have some rights between high and low water, which are even peculiar to himself, and not common. Nor does it ne'cessarily determine the question of the right to make wharves or structures for the convenience of navigation and commerce, and other questions of a similar nature. Nor are municipal powers affected; nor does it imply an unbounded license, on the other side, for every one to do what he pleases, even to the detriment of the owner; nor for an unlimited occupation of the shore.\nThe maxim, sic wtere iuo ut alienum non lcedas, still holds; \u2022 and the powers of an action on the case, of indictment, and injunction, still remain.\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed, and a writ o\u00ed procedendo will issue accordingly.\n(1)\nStockton, X, not having heard the argument, took no part in. the decision, of this cause."},{"case_name":"Lepage, et al. v. McNamara","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/337740\/","date":"1857-09-09","court":"Iowa Supreme Court","content":"Stockton, J.\n\u00a5e first inquire whether the defendant acquired any title to the property in dispute, by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s deed to Simplot, and the subsequent conveyances from Simplot to Biron, and from Biron to defendant. At the death of Lepage, his administrators succeeded to his personal estate, and his real estate, undisposed of by will, descended to his heirs at law. The sale of the real estate, made by the sheriff, under an execution issued on a judgment against the administrators, passed no title to the, purchaser, for the sufficient reason, that the administrators had no title or interest in the real estate of the decedent subject to sale. The statute in force at the time, provided that befpre the real estate of any testator or intestate should be subject to execution upon any judgment against tbe executor or administrator, tbe heirs and devisees, if any, of the decedent, should first be made parties to the judgment. TJpon application and proper showing to the District Court, that judgment has been obtained' against any executor or administrator, to be levied of the goods and chattels of the deceased, and that execution issued thereon, remains unsatisfied, for want of personal estate, and that there is real estate of the deceased liable to the payment of the judgment, upon due notice to the heirs and devisees, unless good cause to the contrary be shown, execution may be awarded against such real estate, under which the interest and title of the heirs and devisees maybe sold and conveyed by the sheriff to the purchaser. Act of 1839, 202, section 16; Act of 1843, 637, section 25; Code, 273, section 1918. The judgment, execution and sheriff\u2019s return, and sheriff\u2019s deed under which the defendant claims title in the premises, were given in evidence by him on the trial, and are made part of the record. The, judgment was against the administrators of Eaptiste Lepage. The execution gave no power to the sheriff to sell real estate, the title to which was in the heirs of Lepage, and not in his administrators. It did not run against the heirs, and it in no manner appears that they were made parties to the judgment, or that execution was awarded against them.\nIt is urged by the counsel for the defendant, that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show that no award of execution was made by the district court against the heirs of Le-page, on the judgment against the administrators, before it will be held by this court, that the proceedings under the execution were void, or conveyed no title to the purchaser; and that in the absence of all proof upon the subject, this court will presume in favor of the regularity of the proceedings of the district court, and that such award of execution was made. \u2019While we do not dispute the correctness of the doctrine maintained by the counsel, as to the presumed regularity of the proceedings of the district court, we do not consider it applicable to the facts of this case. The plaintiffs, to establish their right to recover the premises in dispute, offered evidence to show that Baptiste Le-page died seized of the premises, and that plaintiffs were his heirs at law and legal representatives. This entitled them, prima facie. to recover. The defendant undertook to show a better title, or that the title of the heirs, derived from their ancestor, had been divested in due course of law, and vested in himself. To do this, as he claimed title under a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale, he must give in evidence a judgment and execution under which the property could be sold, and prove the sale of the premises, which may be done either by the sheriff\u2019s deed or the return on the execution. Adams on Ejectment, 272, note; Fenwick v. Floyd, 1 Harr. Gill, 172; Cooper v. Galbraith, 3 Wash. C. C. 546; Fraker v. Brown, 2 Blackford, 298; 12 Johnson, 213.\nThe defendant has introduced the judgment against the administrators of Baptiste Lepage, the execution and sheriffs return, and sheriff\u2019s deed to Simplot, with the subsequent conveyances, in order to show title in the premises in himself. This would be sufficient, if it had also been shown by him, either that the defendants in the judgment and execution, held the title of the property'sold, or that the heirs of Lepage had been made parties, and were bound by the judgment. Nothing of this kind appears. The judgment and execution were against the administrators of Lepage, and not against his heirs, and although it appears that the execution commanded the sheriff to \u201ccause to be made of the goods and \u201c chattels, and for want thereof, of the lands cmd tenements of \u201c James Fanning and Ezekiel C. Dougherty, administra- \u201c tors of Baptiste Lepage, deceased,\u201d the amount of the judgment and costs recovered against them, yet this writ gave no power to the sheriff to sell real estate, the title to which was in the-heirs of Lepage, and not in his administrators. Nothing appears from which we can infer, that the heirs and devisees of the decedent were made parties to the judgment. \"We cannot infer this from the fact that the execution commanded the sheriff, in default of goods and chattels, to sell the lands and tenements of the defendants as administrators; nor can we infer that execution had been awarded against the real estate of the decedent descended or devised to his heirs or devisees. We are of opinion, that the sheriff\u2019s deed conveyed no title to Simplot, in the premises in dispute \u2014 and the subsequent deeds from Simplot to Biron, and from Biron to defendant, are of course inoperative. The district court erred in refusing to give the first instruction asked by plaintiffs, and in charging the jury that said deeds were good and sufficient as' against the plaintiff, and conveyed a valid legal title to defendant.\nWe next proceed to inquire what title in the premises, the defendant acquired by virtue of the conveyance from Bishop Loras. The conveyance expresses upon its face, \u201c that whereas, the said McNamara had purchased the prop- \u201c erty in good faith, had paid a good consideration there- \u201c for, and had made valuable improvements thereon; and \u201c whereas doubts had arisen whether the whole estate of said \u201c Baptiste Lepage in said premises, had been fully convey- \u201c ed to said McNamara; in order that justice may be done, \u201c and the title of said McNamara quieted, the said Mat- \u201c thias Loras, Bishop of Dubuque, by virtue of the said \u201c will, and the power in him vested, and for the further con- \u201c sideration often dollars, conveys all his right, title, claim, \u201c and interest in the lot to the said Me \u00d1amara.\u201d The will of Baptiste Lepage, after providing for the payment of all his debts, contains the following provision: \u201cAll the real \u201c estate of which I shall die seized or possessed, shall fall \u201c into the possession of my wife Genevieve, for her own \u201c use and benefit during her life-time; at which time, 1 \u201c direct and emthorize the Right Reverend Bishop Loras, \u201c or his Successors, to dispose of my real estate, cmd apply \u201cso much thereof, to the. church, or to the education and \u201c maintenance of poor children, as he, in his wisdom, may \u201c thinlc proper cmd legal.\u201d We remark, first, that this is not an application to a court of equity, to establish a trust, or to carry out the charitable \"purpose manifested by the testator in his will. The defendant, is asserting, in a court of law, a legal title derived from Bishop Loras, in order to defeat the estate, claimed to have descendedlo the plaintiffs as heirs at law of the testator. ITe will, of course, be entitled to such consideration and relief only, as a court of law can afford. What interest in the real estate, did Bishop Loras take under the will ? It is not claimed in the argument, that he took any beneficial interest. The utmost that can be maintained is, that the testator by his will, conferred upon him a naked power to sell and dispose of his real estate, upon the death of his wife, unaccompanied with an interest. Conceding this much, and waiving, for the present, the consideration of the question, whether a power to be exercised by \u201cBishop Loras, or his successors,\u201d is void for uncertainty as to the person who is to execute it, and for uncertainty as to whether he is to execute it in his official or individual capacity, the question whether the legal title accompanied the power and vested in the Bishop, must be determined by another question, viz : \u2014 whether there is such a designation of the beneficiaries under the ' trust, or such a dedication of the estate to charity as a court of law will uphold and sustain % The difficulty arising from the uncertainty as to thebeneficiaries,mustbe apparent upon the most casual reading of the will. It is not expressed whether the fund is to be applied to the church, or to educate and maintain poor children; nor is any particular church, nor the poor children of any particular church, city, or place, designated. But even if this were ascertained, only so much of the fund is to go to either the one or the other object, as the Bishop, \u201cin his wisdom, may think proper and legal.\u201d We are clearly of the opinion, that there is here such uncertainty in the beneficiaries, as must render the devise void. Even if the position assumed by the defendant, were true, that the testator designed that the Bishop should take the legal estate as trustee under the' will, the difficulty is not removed. The Bishop took no beneficial interest, and the cestui que trust not being sufficiently indicated, the devise is void.\/ There is, in general, the same necessity for a cestui que trust, capable of talcing the beneficial interest, and so defined and pointed out, as that there shall be no uncertainty, as there is for a properly defined grantee in a deed. Gallego\u2019s Ex. v. Att\u2019y Gen'l, 3 Leigh, 450. If there is such uncertainty, as that it cannot be known who is to take as beneficiary, the trust is void; and the heir, by operation of law, will take the legal estate, stripped of the trust. The testator appears to have had entire confidence in the wisdom of Bishop Loras. If, instead of leaving to the Bishop the duty of making his will, the testator had directed and authorized him to dispose of his real estate, and apply the proceeds thereof to the support of the Gospel, according to the ritual of the church of which he was Bishop, the devise would have been good, under the authority of Johnson v. M. E. Church, 4 Iowa, 180. If he had directed him to apply the proceeds to found an institution for the education and maintenance of the poor children of his church, there is little or no doubt but the devise would have been good. But the testator disposes of his estate for neither the one nor the other of these objects. He does not specify how much of his estate is set apart, or is intended so to be, for charity. It is to be so much as Bishop Loras, \u201c in his wisdom, may think proper and legal.\u201d Not only is the Bishop to designate the amount to bo disposed of in charity, but he is to say whether it is to go to the church, or to the poor children. Here is no expressed will of the testator. It is as though he had made no disposition of his estate. The wisdom of the Bishop, cannot be substituted for the will of the testator. He cannot bo permitted to say, how much of the testator\u2019s estate may \u201c properly and legally \u201d go to charity, nor to decide for him, whether it shall go to the church, or to the education and maintenance of poor children. \"Whatever confidence the testator may have been willing to repose in the judgment of Bishop Loras, he must make his own will. And if he wishes to devote a portion of his estate to purposes of charity, he must point out the object, the property, and the way it should go, or no trust is created which the courts can support and enforce.\nIn reference to the deed from Bishop Loras to defendant, we remark, that it was not made in virtue of any disposition of the real estate made by him under the will, nor to carry out the benevolent purpose of the testator, in favor of charity. On the contrary, it was made to ratify, as far as may be, an illegal and ineffectual sale of the property by the sheriff, on a judgment against the administrators. The deed is, therefore, not to be regarded as a conveyance of the estate, made to carry into effect the testator\u2019s purpose in favor of charity; and is not entitled to the effect sought to be given to it by the defendant\u2019s counsel, as the execution of a power vested by the will in < the Bishop. A naked power, it is held, may be voluntarily executed; but it is only a power coupled with a trust, or beneficial interest, where the nature and objects of the trust are certain, or may be rendered certain, that will be enforced by a court of equity. Moore\u2019s heirs v. Moore\u2019s devisees, &c., 4 Dana, 359. Where there is nothing more than a power of appointment conferred by the testator, there is nothing on which a trust, on general principles, can be fastened. The power conferred in this case on Bishop Loras, may or may not be exercised by him, at his discretion. If he were to appropriate a part, or the whole, of the property to his own use, who is to call him to account for an abuse of the trust, or misapplication of the fund? He is to apply to one of the two objects of the charity, only so much as he may think \u201clegal and proper.\u201d Who is to control his discretion, or correct the abuse of his power ?\nThe rule is well settled, that wills are to be construed, so as to carry out the intention of the testator, so far as may be consistent with the rules of law; and if the entire will, and all its provisions, cannot be sustained, still to sustain and carry it out, as far as may be practicable. Att\u2019y Gen'l v. Wallace, 7 B. Monroe, 617. When the intention is ascertained, it cannot be carried into effect by the prin ciples of the law, the court cannot do that which the.testator might have done, and new model the provisions of the will. The duty of the court, (says Story, J. 3 Peters, 146), is to interpret, and not to make' wills for testators. It is only from necessity, that a devise will be construed absolutely void for uncertainty. If it be possible to reduce it to certainty, it is good. Powell on Devises, 421; 3 Peters, 118. Looking at the will of Baptiste Lepage, and at the devise under which the defendant claims the property in dispute, by conveyance from Bishop Loras, the court cannot give any validity to the devise. . If for no other reason, it is void for uncertainty.\n1. It is uncertain what church is intended.\n2.. It is uncertain what poor children are intended to be the recipients of the testator\u2019s bounty. The poor children of no particular city, county, church or state, are designated. - .\n3. If there were no difficulty in this respect, it is still uncertain whether the testator intended his bounty should go to the church or to the poor children.\n4. It is uncertain how much is to go to the charity. Bishop Loras is to determine not only the object, but the amount of the fund it is to receive, and how much it is proper and legal should be so applied.\n5. It is uncertain whether the Bishop 'is to administer the trust iu his official or in his individual capacity, and whether the power is to be exercised by him or his successors.\nIt will. hardly be profitable to institute an inquiry into the analogy, between the present case, and those in which the chancellor in England, by the application of the civil law doctrine of cy pres, \"gives effect to gifts and devises, where only a general purpose of charity is manifested; or where either, the prescribed object, or the anode of applying it, has failed or become impracticable; or another class of cases, where no particular object is designated, and no trustee named, or person appointed, to select the object, and which are ^administered by the chancellor uaader the pre rogative power, and by virtue of an appointment of the crown, as pcarens patrice. In either class of cases, unless the donor manifest an intention to restrict his bounty to some general object of charity embraced by the statute of 43 Eliz., chap. 4, the legacy or gift will be void, and neither the King nor the chancellor, can make any application of it. Moggridge v. Thackwell, 7 Vesey, 75.\nOur courts of chancery have no other than judicial power, and consequently have no jurisdiction in the second class of cases above' enumerated. The state cannot interfere as parens patriae. If a testator ineffectually dedicates his property to charity, or in such manner that the devise is void, the state has no prerogative right to interfere and dispose of the property, as the King of England has been permitted to do. Att'y Gen. v. United Ins. Co., 2 John. Ch. 386-7; More's Heirs v. More's Devisees, 4 Dana, 366. Even in England, it has been held that the chancellor, as a judge in equity, could not enforce a charitable trust, if according to the rules of the common law, it was either illegal, or void for indeiiniteness, or vague generality. Nor could he, as such, apply the charity to any other purpose than that designated by the donor. He must be governed by the principles of the common law, respecting trusts, adopted from the civil law. Neither the crown, nor the chancellor under his delegated authority, could enforce or appropriate a charitable legacy or gift, which was not valid. Prerogative itself, could not violate the private legal rights of those who, by operation of law, were entitled to property which had been illegally dedicated to charity. See Baptist Association v. Hart's Executors, 4 Wheaton, 1; More's Heirs v. More's Devisees, supra. In the case last cited, Robertson, C. J. delivering the opinion of the court, says : We are satified that the cypres doctrine of England, is not, or should not, be a judicial doctrine, except in one kind of case; and that is, when there is an available charity to an identified or ascertainable object, and a particular mode, inadequate, illegal, or inappropriate, or which happens to fail, has been prescribed. In such case, a court of equity may substitute or sanction any other mode that may be lawful and suitable, and will effectuate the declared intention of the donor, and not arbitrarily, and in the dark, presuming on his motives or wishes declare an object for him. 4 Dana, 366.\nThe principles set forth in the above observation, may be further illustrated by a reference to some of the adjudicated cases. A testatrix bequeathed the residue of her personal estate to the Bishop of Durham, to dispose of the same, \u201cto such objects of benevolence and liberality, as the Bishop, in his own discretion, should most approve of. \u201d The court held the bequest void, on the ground that nothing was a charity, that was not within the letter and the spirit of the statute of 43 Elizabeth 5 and as objects of benevolence and liberality were not within the statute, they were too indefinite to be executed. Morice v. Bishop of Durham, 9 Vesey, 399. A testator bequeathed the residue of his estate to trustees, \u201cfor such purposes as they might consider promised to be most beneficial to the town and trade of Alexandria.\u201d It was held by the Supreme Court of the United States, that the devise could not be sustained, for the reason that the beneficiaries of the trust were uncertain, and the mode of applying the bounty indefinite. Wheeler v. Smith, 9 Howard, 55.\nIn Fountain v. Ravenel, 17 Howard, 369, the testator empowered bis executors, after the death of his wife, to dispose of the residue of his estate, \u201cfor the use of Such charitable institutions of Pennsylvania and South Carolina, as they might deem most beneficial to mankind.\u201d The wife survived the executors. It was held by the same court, that there was not only too great uncertainty as to the beneficiaries, but the more formidable objection, that there was no expressed will of the testator. Having substituted the will of his executors for his own, and they having died before they coidd make the appointment, the fund was never separated from hi's estate, but remained a part of it, unaffected by the bequest. See also Kelley v. Kelly, 25 Pennsylvania State, 460; Gallego v. Att'y Gen'l, 3 Leigh, 450: Wilderman v. City of Baltimore, 8 Maryland, 557; Story\u2019s Equity, section 979. In Wills v. Cowper, 2 Ohio, 124, it is said, that \u201c if a trust be created in a. party, but the terms' by which it is created, are so vague and indefinite that courts of equity cannot clearly ascertain either its objects, or the persons who are to take, then the trust will be held to fail entirely, and the property will fall into the general funds of the author of the trust.\u201d \u201c So, where a testatrix bequeathed the residue of her estate to her executors, upon trust, to dispose of the same at such times, and in such manner, and for such uses and purposes, as they shall think fit, it being my will that the distribution thereof shall be left to their discretion,\u201d it was held void for uncertainty. Ib. section 979, B.\nWith these views of the law, as applicable to the present case, we are of opinion that no legal estate, or beneficial interest, passed to Bishop Loras, under the will, and consequently the conveyance by him of the property in dispute, passed no title to the defendant. The real estate of Baptiste Lepage, after the death of his wife, passed to his heirs, unaffected by the provisions of thfe will. The District Court, therefore, erred in refusing the second, third, and fourth instructions asked by plaintiff, and in charging the jury that Bishop Loras was a legatee under the will in his own right; that the proceeds of the real estate were devised to him absolutely; and that the conveyance by him to defendant, was good and valid against the plaintiffs. The judgment of the District Court will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, npt inconsistent with this opinion.\nJudgment reversed."},{"case_name":"William Tharp, Henry B.

Truman C. Everts, the relator, has filed his petition in this court, for a writ of habeas corpus, averring that he is a citizen of Kentucky, and that in 1849 he was married at Dayton, Ohio, to Eloise H. Morrison, and that in September, 1850, a daughter was born to the parties, named Bessie; that in September, 1856, by reason of the improper conduct of the wife, a separation took place between the parties at Toledo, Ohio, about which time the wife admitted that she had been guilty of adultery; that the said Everts then took charge of the daughter, and removed to the city of New York, where the child was placed in the keeping of his relatives, who, from their wealth and respectability, were fitted to take charge of her nurture and education; that she was placed at school, and was in all things well cared for, happy, and making rapid progress in her education; that in June, 1858, upon the petition of his wife, a proceeding of which he had no notice, and upon allegations which were altogether false, the court of common pleas of Montgomery county, Ohio, rendered a decree annulling the marriage contract between the parties; that while the said Everts was absent in Kentucky, his wife and other persons clandestinely, forcibly, and against the will of the child, abducted her from the school at which j she had been placed, and the custody of those j having charge of her, and removed her to \u00a1 Dayton, where she is forcibly and unlawfully detained by Mrs. Everts, Lenox Compton, and Fielding Lowry. The prayer of the peti tion is, that a writ of habeas corpus issue, requiring the said parties forthwith to produce the said child, with the cause of her detention; and that on the final hearing, she may be restored to the care and custody of the petitioner.\nA writ of habeas corpus issued from this court, according to the prayer of the petition, which has been served on the parties; and they have appeared and filed their answers. Lowry states, in his answer, that the child is not, and has not been, since the filing of the petition, in his custody or under his control. Compton answers, in substance, tha.t he is the stepfather of Mrs. Everts, who brought the child to his residence, near Dayton, in June last, where she has since'remained with her mother; and that he is willing, and has the pecuniary ability to take care of and provide for her till she is of age. He does not claim the right to detain the child, and alleges that she there is, and has been, under the exclusive control and authority of her mother.\nMrs. Everts answers, denying. all the allegations of fault or impropriety of conduct on her part, as set out in the petition. She, admits the custody of the child, and claims the legal right to retain her in charge, as her mother; and also on the ground of the decree of the court of common pleas of Montgomery county, dissolving the marriage contract between her and her husband, and giving to her the custody of the child. She exhibits the record of the proceedings in her application for divorce, from which it appears that Everts being, as averred, a resident of the city of New York, a summons and copy of the petition was addressed by mail to him at New York, and publication made of the filing of the petition in a newspaper printed at Dayton, in accordance with the statute of Ohio. She also avers that the facts set forth in her petition as the grounds of the decree are true, and were substantiated by sufficient and credible testimony, and that there was no fraud or illegality in the proceedings resulting in such decree. \u00a1This statement presents, briefly, the points arising in this unfortunate controversy, as exhibited in the petition of the relator, and the answers of the respondents. Upon these, the inquiries are: First, is the decree of the court of common pleas of Montgomery county, dissolving the marriage contract between the parties, and awarding alimony and the custody of the child to Mrs. Everts, so far conclusive as to preclude inquiry into the facts on which the decree was based, and the evidence touching the question, whether the husband or the wife is the more suitable person to have the custody and control of the daughter; and, second, if the decree is not conclusive, whether from the facts before the court, there is sufficient warrant for the order prayed for by the relator, that the child be taken from the possession of the mother, and transferred to that of the father.]\nUpon the facts thus presented, the court must first consider the grave question of its jurisdiction to take cognizance of this case,- and make the order prayed for by the relator, even conceding the case made by him in the petition to be sustained by the evidence. It is strenuously insisted by counsel that this jurisdiction does not exist, and that, therefore, it is the plain duty of the court to dismiss the petition. It is, perhaps, to be regretted that this question was not made upon the application for the writ, and before the parties had incurred the expense of taking the great mass of evidence on file. But it is not too late now, as the want of jurisdiction is not waived by the appearance of the parties, and the presentation of the defense on other grounds.\nThe question indicated has been argued at great length, and with much ability. In support of the jurisdiction of the court, probably every authority bearing on the question has been adduced, and the cases and principles referred to have been amplified and enforced with great ingenuity and learning. And I enter upon its consideration with a proper sense of its importance, and of the responsibility assumed in its decision. I may add, that I deeply regret the unavoidable absence of the circuit judge at the hearing in this case, which has deprived the parties of the benefit of his great learning and mature judicial experience in the determination of this question.\nIn the outset, I may remark that it is distinctly conceded by the counsel for the relat- or that the court must find its warrant for the jurisdiction claimed in the constitution and laws of the United States. No principle can be more definitively settled than that the courts of the Union, from the highest to the lowest, are courts of limited jurisdiction, in the sense that they can call into action no powers not expressly conferred by law, or incidental to those' granted. Thus, in Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch [8 U. S.] 75, Chief Justice Marshall says: \u201cCourts which originate in the common law, possess a jurisdiction which must be regulated by the common law, until some statute shall change their established principles; but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, can not transcend that jurisdiction.\u201d This principle, thus established at an early day by the supreme court, applicable to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, has, in numerous cases, received the sanction of that court\nThe question now under consideration must, therefore, be decided with reference to the legislation of congress, defining the jurisdiction of the federal courts in cases of habeas corpus. [But before noticing the statutory provisions on this subject, it may be well to state the precise character of the detention or imprisonment alleged by the relator to be unlawful, and as a remedy for which the action of this court is sought The case there briefly stated, as made in the relator\u2019s petition, is that of a father living separate from his wife, asserting a legal right to the custody of a female child of the age of eight years, who, he alleges, is illegally detained by the mother. For the purposes of the present inquiry, it is not material to refer to the facts involved in this unfortunate domestic controversy. The sole question now under consideration is, whether, supposing the case as presented in the petition of the relator to be sustained by the evidence, the interposition of this court, through the writ of habeas corpus, can be legally invoked.]\nThe claim for the exercise of jurisdiction In this case is based mainly on section 14 of the judiciary act of 1789 (1 Stat 81). This section provides \u201cthat all the before-mentioned courts of the United States (the supreme court and the circuit and district courts) shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary to the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law. And either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment: provided, that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in jail, unless where they are in. custody, under or by color of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.\u201d\nThe question arising on the clause of the foregoing section, granting the power to the courts of the United States to issue the writ of habeas corpus, is, whether the limitation expressed in the words, \u201call other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary to the exercise of their respective jurisdictions,\u201d is applicable to the writs of scire facias and habeas corpus, previously named. The learned counsel for the relator insists that the power to grant the two writs specifically named, is distinct and independent, and not affected or controverted by the limitation to \u201cother writs\u201d necessary to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts. On the other hand, it is claimed, in an argument of great force, that the words of limitation referred to, apply as well to the writs designated as to all other writs; and that the writs authorized under that clause are such only as are necessary to the just exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts. If this construction of the statute is sustainable, it is clear this court has no authority to act in the case made in this petition, and must necessarily order its dismissal.\nIt is not a matter that should excite surprise, that no case is found in the imports of the supreme court of the United States, in which an authoritative construction has been given to the clause of the statute under consideration. The supreme court, as decided in Ex parte Barry, 2 How. [43 U. S.] 65, has no original jurisdiction under that clause to issue the writ of habeas corpus. While, therefore, there have been numerous applications to that court for the writ of habeas corpus, they have been based on the latter clause of the section, and have involved only the exercise of the revisory power of the eourt, in passing on the legality and validity of commitments and imprisonments under the orders or process of inferior courts.\nin the case of Ex parte Boll man,'before referred to, this question was not involved; but Chief Justice Marshall, in giving the opinion of the court,' ref ers to it, though h\u00e9 does not expressly decide it He remarks, that \u201cthe only doubt of which this section (14) can be susceptible is, whether the restrictive words of the first sentence limit the power to the award of such writs of habeas corpus as are necessary to enable the courts of the United States to exercise their respective jurisdictions in some causes which they are capable of deciding. It has been urged that in strict grammatical construction, these words refer to the last antecedent, which is \u2018all other writs not specially provided for by statute.\u2019\u201d And he adds, \u201cthis criticism may be correct, and is not entirely without its influence; but the sound construction which the court thinks it safer to adopt is, that the true sense is to be determined by the nature of the provision and by the context\u201d This is a clear intimation, that as a question of mere grammatical construction it is not free of doubt, and availing myself of the hint given by the chief justice, I have endeavored to attain a conclusion as to the sense of the clause from its nature, and its connection with other parts of the section.\nAnd, in the first place, it is worthy of remark that the power to award the writs of scire facias and habeas corpus, in the first part of the section, is \u201cto all the before-named courts of the United States,\u201d meaning the supreme, circuit, and district courts. It is to be noticed that all the courts are placed on a footing of equality as to their power to grant the writs named or referred to. Now, it is most obvious that the grant of this power to the supreme court is not within the cases enumerated in the constitution of the United States, in which that court can exercise original jurisdiction. That court, in the case Ex parte Barry [supra], expressly decided that it had no original jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus, in the case of a child alleged by the father to be illegally detained in the custody and possession of the mother. There is no room for a doubt as to the correctness of this decision. That court long since decided that congress could not confer upon it original jurisdiction in any case not within the specifications in the constitution. *\nOn the ground taken by the counsel for the relator, the clause of the statute under consideration authorizes all the courts named to grant the writ of habeas corpus in any case where personal restraint or imprisonment of the person is alleged, without restriction or limitation. Our present inquiry is, whether it was within the intention of the act of congress of 17S9 to clothe those courts with such a jurisdiction. And it seems to the court, in taking the affirmative of this inquiry, we charge on that congress the folly of attempt-ihg'to confer original jurisdiction on the supreme court, in palpable conflict with the constitution of the United States. I do not suppose that such a suspicion can attach to the distinguished statesmen who composed that congress. It was the first congress convened after the adoption of the constitution of the United States, and not a few of its most influential members had been prominent in the convention that framed that instrument. Of these men it may be well said, that for sagacity, statesmanship, and profound learning they have had no superiors in any after period of our history, and we should be slow in admitting that they could have sanctioned an intended violation of the constitution. At all events such a conclusion should rest on a firmer basis than a doubtful question of grammatical construction.\nBut there is no occasion for any inference in the least discreditable to the intelligence or purity of the congress of 1789. No violence was intended, and in my judgment none is committed on the constitution by the clause of the statute under consideration. Its language fairly imports a power in the courts of the United States to grant the writ of habeas corpus and all other writs proper and necessary in the just exercise of their jurisdiction. And I can see nothing in the grammatical construction of the clause that calls for any other sense than I have indicated. There was an -apparent propriety in designating the important writs of scire fa-cias and habeas corpus; and then, to avoid prolixity and the useless specification of all the other writs and processes necessary to the salutary exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts, to adopt the comprehensive form of expression, \u201call other writs.\" These latter words, by every rule of grammatical construction, are connected with and refer to the writs of scire facias and habeas corpus before named.\nThere is another consideration in the construction of the statute which is entitled to great weight. As already noticed in the first clause of the section, the power to grant the writ of habeas corpus is to the courts and not to a single judge; while in that clause of the section authorizing the writ \u201cfor the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment,\u201d any judge of any of the courts is empowered to award it. There is a plain and obvious reason for this distinction. If the power to grant a habeas corpus is given in the first clause of the section only where necessary to the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court, there is great propriety, if not necessity, that the writ should be ordered by the court and not by a single-judge. The clause, beyond question, contemplates the ' grant of the writ for the enforcement of jurisdiction in some proceeding or case pending in the court in which the writ is prayed for. And that court alone, in its capacity as a court, and not a single judge, is best qualified to decide, judicially, whether the writ is necessary to enforce its jurisdiction. On the other hand, when the great prerogative writ \u2014 the writ of liberty \u2014 the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum \u2014 authorizing an inquiry into the cause of commitment, provided for in the second clause of the statute is referred to, any judge of any of the courts is empowered to grant it The reason of this is, that when a case of unlawful imprisonment, under color of legal process or authority exists, there is a necessity for prompt and speedy action; and hence the party is entitled to be heard before a single judge, without waiting a regular session of a court, which might be months distant, and at a point remote from the place of the imprisonment of the party applying for deliverance. That this was the writ contemplated by the authors of the constitution in the clause which prohibits its suspension except in certain emergencies, is quite obvious. They could have no reference to the writ as used to relieve from either actual or constructive restraints or imprisonments of the person resulting from the relations of master and servant, guardian and ward, parent and child, or husband and wife. It was doubtless intended to protect against those invasions of personal liberty which are perpetrated under color of legal or official authority. The framers of the constitution had in view those outrages and usurpations which characterized the worst periods in the history of the British nation, by which the personal liberty of the citizen was invaded, from political considerations, but with the forms of legal authority. As a remedy for such abuses of power, and disregard of legal and constitutional rights, the judges of the courts of the United States are invested with the authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus and inquire into the cause of commitment '\nAnd, under the clause referred to, there is no limitation to the power of the judges ex. cept that contained in the proviso which prohibits them from granting a habeas corpus where the imprisonment is by state process or under state authority. As before intimated, the numerous authorities cited by counsel refer to cases where the writ has issued under the clause here referred to; and these cases need not therefore be specially noticed, as they have no application to the question under consideration.\nIt is claimed, however, that there are other cases which sustain the jurisdiction now asserted for this court. The case of U. S. v. Green [Case No. 15,250] has been cited in support of the position assumed by the counsel for the relator. It was a case of habeas corpus, presenting a question as to the rightful custody of an infant daughter, alleged to be wrongfully detained by the grandfather of the child. It is true the writ in that case was allowed by Judge Story, in the circuit court; but it does not appear, that either on the petition for the writ, or upon its return, the question of jurisdiction was presented. And, before any final action by the court, the parties entered into an amicable arrangement, as to the custody of the child, which received the sanction of the court. This can not be claimed as an authoritative decision, on the point now before this court\nIt is also insisted that the case of Ex parte Barry, before referred to, is in support of the jurisdiction of this court The only point decided in that case was, that the supreme court of the United States had no original jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus prayed for, and therefore dismissed the proceeding. In the opinion by Judge Story, the court say: \u201cWithout, therefore, entering into the merits of the present application, we are compelled by our duty to dismiss the petition, leaving the petitioner to seek redress in such other tribunal of the United States as may be entitled to grant it\u201d This is but an intimation that the lower courts might have jurisdiction, but the question did not arise in the case, and can not be claimed as a decision by the supreme court\nThe case of U. S. v. Williamson [Case No. 10,726] is also relied on as an authority by the counsel for the relator. This case was decided by the late Judge Kane, of the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. The circumstances under which the writ issued were briefly as follows: Wheeler, the relator, was the owner of three slaves, who, as he alleged in his petition, were forcibly taken from his possession at Philadelphia by Williamson, and by him were unlawfully detained in custody. The prayer of the petition was, that Williamson might be required to produce the slaves before the court, with the reasons of his claim to detain them. The learned judge held that the court had jurisdiction under the first clause of section 14 of the act of 1789. I do not propose to notice critically the grounds on which he asserted the jurisdiction of the court Por reasons stated before, I am clear in the opinion that the construction given by Judge Kane to the statute in question is essentially erroneous. With all my respect for his legal intelligence and ability, I can not acquiesce in his conclusions. And the authority of his opinion is certainly not strengthened by the fact that no other case has been reported in which this latitudinous claim of jurisdiction has been judicially affirmed.\nIn at least one case of respectable authority, a contrary doctrine has been strongly asserted. I refer to the case In re Barry [42 Fed. 113], in which Judge Betts, holding the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus in a case, the facts of which were very similar to those now before this court, on the ground of a want of jurisdiction. The case was, substantially, that Barry, an alien, married in the city of New York; and having lived some years with his wife, and after two children were born, by reason of some unfortunate difficulty between them, they separated, one of the children being in the custody of the father and the other of the mother. In 1844, Barry, for the purpose of obtaining the custody of the child remaining with the mother, filed his petition in the circuit court of the United States for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging a lawful right to the child as the father, and that the child was illegally and forcibly detained by the mother. Judge Betts refused to award the writ, on the ground before stated. I have seen no full report of his opinion, but it is referred to in [Barry v. Mercein] 5 How. [46 U. S.] 103, and from the report it appears that Barry obtained a writ of error from the supreme court, to reverse the judgment of Judge Betts. This writ was dismissed by the supreme court, on the ground that there was no pecuniary amount in controversy, and that the court therefore had not jurisdiction. Two of the points of Judge Betts\u2019 decision are stated in the report of that case as follows: \u201cI deny the writ of habeas corpus prayed for, because: 1. If granted, and a return was made, admitting the facts stated in the petition, I should discharge the infant on the ground that the court can not exercise the common law functions of parens patriae, and has no common law jurisdiction in the matter. 2. .The court has not judicial cognizance of the matter, by virtue of any statute of the United States.\u201d .\nThe conclusions thus stated by Judge Betts accord fully with my judgment I have before given some of the reasons for the opinion, that the - statute does not grant the power claimed for the court in this case. And that view is, I think, decisive of the pending question. But it is contended in argument, that if it should be held that the statute does not confer the power, as a matter of substantive and independent jurisdiction, the writ of habeas corpus is proper as an ancillary process, to enable the court to exercise jurisdiction. If I understand the argument on this point, it is, in substance, that the child who is the subject of this controversy, legally owes labor and service to the petitioner, as her father; that she has escaped from the state of New York, where such labor and service were due, into the state of Ohio, and is subject to reclamation as a fugitive, by the father, under the acts of congress of 1793 [1 Stat 302] and 1850 [9 Stat 462]; and that the writ issued in this case is in aid of the jurisdiction of this court, under said acts, and therefore within the scope of the first clause of section 14 of the act of 1789. I shall notice this position very briefly, remarking, in the first place, that it would be, in my judgment, a perverted construction of the acts for reclaiming fugitives from service, to hold that they can have any application to a female child of eight years of age. Such a child, within the contemplation of these statutes, can not be said to owe labor and service to the father. And again, it is clear there has been no- such escape as within the purview of these statutes is required, to bring a person within their operation. There must be an escape, implying the will or purpose to escape, which certainly can not be predicated of an infant child. But there is a still more conclusive objection to the construction insisted on. The clause .authorizing a habeas corpus in aid of .the jurisdiction of a court, clearly contemplates .a suit or proceeding in esse, and that such writ is necessary as subsidiary to the exercise of jurisdiction. It would vest the courts with-a dangerous amplitude of discretion, if they could use the writ of habeas corpus as an instrument to bring a party within their jurisdiction for an ulierior purpose.\nThe jurisdiction, then, does not exist on the ground just indicated \u2014 and I am equally clear there is no other ground on which it can be sustained. I do not say it is not within the competency of congress to give the power claimed to the courts or judges of the United States. The constitution includes in the grant of judicial power controversies between citizens of different states, but there is no statutory provision which brings the proceeding by habeas corpus within the scope of this provision. Section 11 of the act of 1789 gives to the circuit courts original cognizance concurrently with the state courts, of all civil suits at common law and in equity, where the plaintiff is a citizen of a state other than that in which suit is brought, and the matter in dispute exceeds five hundred dollars. But this does not include a proceeding by habeas corpus, for the plain reason, if there were no other, that the matter in controversy has no pecuniary value, and can not be estimated in money.\nIt follows, as the result of these views, that this proceeding must be dismissed, for want of jurisdiction. If I entertained a serious doubt on this question, I should hesitate to exercise the power invoked for this court. But, in the light in which I view it, the line of duty is so clearly indicated, that I should be wholly without excuse if I did not follow it. This result renders it wholly unnecessary to express an opinion as to the effect of the record in the proceeding in the state court, or to review the evidence introduced by the parties.\n2\n[From 7 Am.

Hunter","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/497761\/","date":"1859-01-01","court":"New York Court of Appeals","content":"I. The Legislature, as the sovereign power of the State, had the power to authorize and direct the transfer, conversion, sale or other disposition of the interests which the cestuis que trust, and the children of Mrs. Barber and Mrs. Leggett in esse at the time of the passage of the acts had in the land. 1. It has frequently exercised such power. (Act relating to Spingler's Estate, Laws 1829, 567; Act relating to Morris\u2019 Estate, Laws 1853, 19; Act relating to Estate of T. B. Clarke, Laws 1814, ch. 78, which was decided to be valid in 20 Wend., 365.) 2. The possession of such power by the Legislature has been established by judicial decisions. (Clark v. Van Surlay, 15 Wend., 436; S. C. in Error, 20 id., 365; Rice v. Parkman, 16 Mass., 326; Edwards v. Pope, 3 Scam., 465; Morris v. Clymer, 2 Barr, 277; Bases cited under next point.)\nII. The Legislature had the power by the acts in question to direct a sale of the real estate so as to bind the interests of any future children who might be born to Mrs. Leggett and. Mrs. Barber, and who would, on their birth, become interested in the remainder created by the will. 1. The Legislature is jested with all the powers of government, which have not been expressly or impliedly delegated to other departments, or reserved to the people themselves by the provisions of the Constitution; and there are no restraints upon its power, except such as are imposed by that instrument. (Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall., 386; Cooper v. Telfair, 4 id., 19; People v. Draper, 15 N. Y., 543, 549; Town of Guildford v. The Supervisors, 3 Kern., 146; Cochrane v. Van Surlay, 20 Wend., 381, Verplanck, Sen.; Wynehamer v. The People, 3 Kern., 378, 391, 410, 428, 440, 451, 464; per Comstock, J., 391, 392; per Johnson, J., 410-413; per Selden, J., 428, 432; per Hubbard, J., 452; per T. A. Johnson, J., 464, 465, 476; Benson v. The Mayor, 24 Barb., 252; Clarke v. The City of Rochester, 24 Barb., 450, 470, 480, 489.) 2. The Legislature possesses absolute dominion over property, except so far as it has been restricted by the Federal and State Constitutions, and there is no restraint upon legislative interference, even with vested rights of property, except that provided by those Constitutions. (Edwards v. Pope, 3 Scam., 465 ; Morris v. Clymer, 2 Barr, 277; Carroll v. Lessee of Olmstead, 16 Ohio, 251.) 3. If the Legislature is vested with the entire legislative power of the people, except so far as it is restricted by the Constitution, then an act of the Legislature, unless it be in violation of the Constitution, \u201c is as absolute and uncon tollable as any act of the British Parliament, or as any law flowing from the sovereign power of any form of government.\u201d (1 Kent Com., 441-448; same cases cited in last Point; Counsel arguendo, 8 Cow., 566; Rice v. Parkman, 16 Mass., 826 ; Edwards v. Pope, 3 Scam,., 465; 5 Cruise's Dig., tit. 33, 1; 2 Bl. Com,., 345; Walker v. Holman, 16 Peters, 367.) 4. The cases above cited, decided by the courts of this State, and which upheld the acts in relation to the estate of T. B. Clarke, sustained them on the very ground that the Legislature, in respect to persons laboring under disability, acted as parens patrias. No power to act as such is conferred, expressly or by implication, upon the Legislature by the Constitution, and the existence of it cannot be claimed upon any other principle than that here contended for. (15 Wend., 436; 20 id., 365.) 5. Upon the same principle depends the power of the Legislature to enact general statutes relating to the estates of infants and lunatics, the acts relating to partition of lands, and the various acts relating to estates tail, joint tenancies and tenancies in common. 6. Tire legislative authority of every independent government, when unrestricted by express limitation, is sufficiently extensive to- embrace the power to pass the acts in question. (2 Bl. Com., 345; 5 Cruise's Dig., private acts, tit. 33; 8 Cow., 566; Edwards v. Pope, 3 Scam., 465; Carroll v. Lessee of Olmstead, 16 Ohio, 251; Morris v. Clymer, 2 Barr, 277.)\nIII. The provisions of the Federal Constitution, which prohibits the States from passing any ex post facto law or laws impairing the obligation of contracts, have no application to the question before us. (Const. of U. S., Art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 10; 1 Kent Com., 409, Lect. 19, part 2; Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 17 How. U. S., 456; Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall., 386; Satterlee v. Mathewson, 2 Peters, 413.)\nIY. The 1st section of the 1st article of the State Constitution, which provides that no member of the State shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof, unless by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers, has no application. (Const., art. 1, \u00a7 1.) 1. This section applies only to persons in esse, and cannot be reasonably construed to embrace those in futuro. 2. The rights referred to are personal rights, as distinguished from rights of property.\nV. 'The acts in question are not in violation of the part of the 6th section of the same article of the State Constitution, which provides \u201c That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken.for public use without compensation.\u201d 1. This provision applies only to persons in esse. It cannot be said that persons in futuro have property or vested rights in property any more than they have life or liberty. 2. Eo instanti each person comes into'being, he becomes subject to all the then existing laws of the State to which he owes allegiance, and can claim no rights either of person or property, other than such as are subject to, consistent with and established' by such laws. 3. The right of transmitting property after death is derived wholly from the sovereign power, and it cannot be exercised, except under such regulations as may be prescribed in reference thereto. 4. If the State, before the birth of a person who, under laws existing at the death of a testator, would be entitled to an interest in property devised by will, should enact a law creating new rules and regulations for the transmission of property, and declaring that the interest which would otherwise pass to such individual should not so pass, such act could not be said to affect any vested rights, or impair the obligation of contracts. ( Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 17 How. U. S., 462; Morris v. Clymer, 2 Barr, 277; Edwards v. Pope, 3 Scam., 465; Carroll v. Lessee of Olmstead, 16 Ohio, 251.)\nVI. The right of the Legislature to pass various statute^, such as those relating to estates tail and joint tenancies, and the sales of lands liable to be sold for taxes and the conveyance thereof in fee simple, depends upon the principle herein contended for, and has been repeatedly sustained by judicial decision. 1. The statute of this State, in regard to estates .tail, declared that all estates in tail should be and thereby were .abolished, and that all persons then seised in fee tail should be deemed seised of the same in fee simple. (Act 12 July, 1782; reenacted February 23, 1786.) 2. By that act remainders vested in interest in persons in being were destroyed, and the precedent estate converted into a fee simple. 3. It was decided that this act should be liberally construed, and on this principle it was held, although against the grammatical construction of the words used, that the act of 1782 was prospective. (Leon v. Burtiss, 20 Johns., 487; Jackson v. Van Zandt, 12 Johns., 169; Vanderheyden v. Crandall, 2 Denio, 9; Wendell v. Crandall, 1 Comst., 492, 493; Lott v. Wycoff, 2 Comst., 357, 358; 4 Kent Com., 11\u201415, showing the different States which have passed similar acts.) 4. Various statutes converting joint tenancies into tenancies in common have been sustained against objections like those here urged against the acts now under consideration. (Bambaugh v. Bambaugh, 11 Serg. & Rawle, 193; Holbrook v. Finney, 4 Mass., 568.) 5. The various provisions of the statutes regulating proceedings in partition and providing for the sale of the premises where an actual partition cannot be had, depend, upon the same principles. 6. The various statutes providing for the sale in fee simple of property liable to be sold for taxes, and the apportionment thereof between the tenant for life and remainderman, are as broad and sweeping in their effects as the acts in question. (Laws 1841, ch. 341, p. 325, \u00a7 2; Laws 1842, ch. 154, p. 191, \u00a7 2; Laws 1855, ch. 327, p. 539, \u00a7 6.) 7. These acts, last specified, have been construed sufficient to pass to the purchaser the estates of the life tenant and of the remaindermen, whether in esse or not, and have been adjudged to be constitutional. (Jackson v. Babcock, 16 N. Y., 249; Blakely v. Calder, 15 id., 617.) 8. For other instances in which a similar exercise of legislative power has been sustained by judicial decision. (Sergeant v. Kuhn, 2 Barr., 393; Estep v. Hutchinson, 14 Serg. & Rawle, 435.)\nVII. The case of Powers v. Bergen (2 Seld., 358), which is relied on by the appellants\u2019 counsel, is clearly distinguishable from that now before the court. 1. The acts in that case authorized a sale without any adjudication of any court or body as to the necessity or propriety of a sale. 2. Nothing appeared on the face of those acts, or in that case, showing what facts existed to induce their passage. 8. It did not appear in that case that any incapacity existed, by reason of infancy or otherwise, disqualifying the remaindermen from disposing of the estate in the lands themselves, and this fact had a controlling influence with the court in making that decision. (See opinion at page 366; per Johnson, J., 3 Kern., 417.) 4. These objections are obviated in the present case.\nAllen, J. The validity of the trusts in this case was settled by this court in Leggett v. Perkins (2 Comst., 297). It was there held that the trustees took a fee in the real estate of the testator by implication: that the testator having constituted his executors trustees of the estate devised to the daughters during their lives, and having authorized them as such trustees \u201c to take charge of, manage and improve the same, and to pay over to them from time to time the rents, interest and net income thereof, it was \u201cvery obvious that a legal estate in the premises was necessary to enable the trustee to discharge these duties.\u201d It was moreover held that the trust was a valid one under the 3d subdivision of section 55 of the statute of uses and trusts (1 R. S., 729); and that by section 60 of the same statute the whole estate in law and equity vested in the trustees. The court decided that the direction to receive and pay over to his daughters \u201cthe rents, interest, or net income thereoff instead of using the words \u201cto apply them to the use of those persons,\" was sufficient, and invested them with the legal estate within the principle as laid down in Brewster v. Striker (2 Comst., 19). These questions, therefore, must be considered as settled so far as they bear upon a decision of those now before the court, and it would be useless and unprofitable at this time to discuss or review the very able opinions of those judges whose views met with a favorable reception by a majority of the court.\nIt is contended by the counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff, as trustee, could derive no power of sale under the will, because the powers and trusts were conferred on three executors and trustees, and were personal and limited to them.\nThe case shows that Caleb S. Woodhull was the only person named who consented to act and did act under the will; the other two renounced their appointment as executors, and declined to act as such, and have both since deceased. Letters testamentary were issued to Woodhull, and he acted as sol\u00e9 executor and trustee until the plaintiff, Leggett, was substituted in his stead. Under these circumstances, the sale by him to Manley was equally as valid as if the other executors had joined in the sale. By section 55 (2 R. S., 109), it is enacted that where any real estate or interest therein is given or devised by any will legally executed to the executors named therein or any of them, to be sold by them or any of them, or where such estate is ordered to be sold by them or any of them, and any executor shall neglect or refuse to take upon him the execution of such will, then all sales made by the executor or executors, who shall take upon them the execution of such will, shall be equally valid, as if the other executors had joined in such sale. Section 15 (2 Revised Statutes, 71), enacts that every person named in a will, and not named as such in the letters testamentary, shall be deemed to be superseded thereby, and shall have no power or authority whatever as such executor, until he shall appear and qualify.\nThe case of Taylor v. Morris (1 Comst., 341) was one where a testator had appointed three persons his executors, and authorized them, or the survivor of them, to sell and convey any part of his real estate, \u201cin case they should find it proper or most fit, in their opinion,\u201d to sell the same for the purpose of paying his debts. Two of the executors neglected to qualify, and never acted as such. The other executor qualified and took out letters testamentary in his own name only, and subsequently sold and conveyed a portion of the testator\u2019s real estate. The court held that the power contained in the will was well executed; that -the conveyance was valid, and that the power extended as well to discretionary as to peremptory powers of sale, whether it was coupled with an interest or not. In the present case the power is \u201cto sell and dispose of all and any part of the (testator\u2019s) estate, both real and personal, either at \u201cpublic or private sale, and at such times and in such manner, and for such sum or sums as to them, in the exercise of their best judgment, may seem most expedient,\u201d bringing \u2018the case in its most important features almost precisely within that just cited. The principle had before been established by the cases cited by Judge Ruggles in his opinion, and also in Niles v. Stevens (4 Denio, 399), where an executor refused to act, and an executrix duly qualified. The court held that the devise vested the estate in the executrix as though she only had been named, and that her conveyance passed a valid title. The cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel in opposition to this doctrine (Sinclair v. Jackson, 8 Cow., 584, and Green v. Miller, 6 John., 39), were decided before the adoption of the Revised Statutes, and do not therefore conflict with the decisions made after their adoption: besides, in the former case, the trustees had all taken upon themselves the execution of the trust, and one of them had not joined in the execution of the instrument, though living at the time of its date.\nThe trust created in the will was an express trust in respect to the interest of the two daughters. (1 R. S., 728, \u00a7 55, subd. 3; Leggett v. Perkins, 2 Comst., 297.)\nThe other two executors having renounced and having subsequently died, Mr. Woodhull, the only executor who qualified, became clothed with all the powers conferred by the will upon .all the trustees. The fifth clause appointed the executors trustees to the estate of the two daughters, and authorized and directed them, \u201c as such trustees, to take charge of all such portion of the estate as was given to them respectively, and to take care of, manage and improve the same to the best advantage, and to pay over to them respectively from time to time the rent, interest or net income thereof.\u201d It further authorized and directed the \u201c executors,\u201d in case of any sale or sales of the real estate, or any part thereof, to put out and invest the shares, devised to the daughters respectively, of the proceeds, and to secure the same by bond and mort gage on such real estate as they should judge ample and sufficient for its permanent safety and security; or, in the exercise of their discretion, to invest the proceeds in the purchase of. real estate for the benefit of them. And afterwards, in the execution of the trust, at any time, if they thought best, to sell the same, or any real estate so purchased, with the allowance of the Court of Chancery first had and obtained for that purpose. It is pretty evident from this whole clause that the allusion to them as executors, so far as the provisions and powers therein are concerned, was as to their capacity as trustees, and not merely as executors, as such, under other provisions of the will.\nWoodhull, therefore, was empowered and authorized to invest the daughters\u2019 shares of the proceeds of the real estate, if sold under the will, in the purchase of real estate for their use and benefit.\nIt appears that among other real estate, the testator died seised and possessed in fee, as tenant in common with his brother William Post, of what was known as the \u201c Post Farm,\u201d situate in the city of Brooklyn. That on the 1st day of March, 1837, Woodhull, as executor, &c., sold and conveyed, by deed of that date, to Robert Manly, the undivided moiety of that'farm for the consideration of $150,000 ; and took back from him a bond and mortgage covering the premises, to him as executor, for the purpose of securing the payment of the purchase money. That mortgage was foreclosed, and on the sale Woodhull purchased a portion of the mortgaged premises, and took a deed therefor in his official character. Mo division or partition of the real estate had then been made; and by this purchase he held two-fifth parts of the property as the shares of the two daughters, and the residue for the benefit of the other devisees under the will. The question here arises, what title did he acquire by the purchase under the foreclosure. By the fifth clause of the will the executors (as trustees) were fully empowered, as they thought best and most advisable, to partition, divide or make sale of all or' any part of the real estate owned between the brother of the testator and himself; \u201cand on. any such division or sale to take and accept as the share of my estate, or some part thereof, and also to purchase either at public or private sale for the benefit of my estate generally, or for some one or more of my children, so much of the property so sold or divided as they might judge most expedient and proper, and most beneficial to all persons interested therein.\u201d Under this clause it appears to me that Mr. Woodhull became not only invested with the legal title to the property, so far as the daughters\u2019 life estate in their shares was concerned, but also to the rights and interests of their children. It was probably for the benefit of all persons interested in the estate, that the premises under the mortgage sale should be purchased in by the trustee. At all events, it seems that he came to such conclusion, in the exercise of his discretionary power granted in the will. He could not well sell, dispose of or purchase real estate for their benefit, unless all his acts in relation to such purchases and sales were for the ultimate benefit of the children, nor unless their rights could be sold, or could be affected, or benefited by the purchase of real estate, or investment of money therein, as the trustee should think proper. One was necessarily incident to and a consequence of the other. And the evident intent of the testator could not be carried into full effect, without giving to the clause this construction. In other words, the purchase back under the Manly mortgage was an investment of their shares of the proceeds of the sale in real estate, as authorized by the will, to the daughters for life, and to the children after them. Otherwise no real estate could be purchased by them, or investment made, which would enure to the benefit of the children. Woodhull, therefore, took the whole legal estate in fee by implication, so far as the infants were concerned. By the partition afterwards, he held two-fifths as the share of the daughters and their infant children, until his resignation as trustee. If this be so he had the power to sell, under the approbation of the Court of Chancery (now of the Supreme Court), until his resignation. He did not sell, however, but resigned his trust, and by an order of the Supreme Court, bearing date the 30th day of March, 1850, the plaintiff, William H. Leggett, was appointed trustee under the will in his stead, with all the powers, trusts and interests which had existed in his predecessor.\nThe next question which arises, therefore, is, whether the Supreme Court could confer all the powers of the original upon a substituted trustee.\nThe statute in relation to uses and trusts (1 R. S., 730, \u00a7 69,) declares, that upon the petition of any trustee the Supreme Court may accept his resignation and discharge him from the trust, under such regulations as shall be established by the court for that purpose, and upon such terms as the rights and interests of the persons interested in the execution of the trust may require. A subsequent section provides for the removal of any trustee who shall have violated or threaten to violate his trust, or who shall be insolvent, or shall be deemed unsuitable. The 71st section enacts that the Supreme Court shall have full power to appoint a new trustee in place of a trustee resigned or removed, or cause the trust to be executed by one of its officers under its direction. These sections extend only to cases of express trust, to which class the present confessedly belongs. But they are extended by section 102, to apply equally to powers in trust, and the grantees of such powers. The plaintiff, Leggett, was substituted trustee under these provisions, and it appears to me that he had full power under them to execute the trusts remaining under the will, under the approbation of the Supreme Court. It is a well settled principle, that a court of equity will not permit a devise in trust, which is valid in other respects, to fail for the want of a trustee. (4 Ves., 708; 5 id., 495; 6 id, 656; 8 Paige, 295; 1 Barb. Ch., 565; 2 id., 381.)\nIt is insisted, however, that Leggett was not invested with the powers of his predecessor, because the proceedings for that purpose were commenced by action instead of petition. It is believed that this objection is not tenable. The 69th section is, that when the application is by a trustees for permission to resign, it may be upon petition; but the section does not declare that the trustee shall or may not commence by action. Indeed, the latter is the most solemn and conclusive mode, and includes in its definition the proceeding by petition. In the matter of Van Wyck (1 Barb. Ch., 565), just cited, the Chancellor remarked that the usual and most proper course of proceeding for the purpose of changing a trustee was by bill (action now), to which all persons interested are either actually or constructively made parties. There is no force in this pbjection.\nLeggett, -therefore, being thus substituted, was, in my judgment, vested with all the powers of Woodhull, and was authorized to sell as he did under the proceedings instituted in the Supreme Court. No objections have been raised by the defendants to the regularity of these proceedings nor to the form of the deed tendered. My conclusion on this branch of the case is, that the defendants would acquire a good title to the premises under the deed executed by Leggett as trustee under the will; and it was well remarked by my brother Strong,. in his opinion in the 'court below, that the fact that \u201c it had been sanctioned by the Legislature, and that others had joined with him in the conveyance, would not surely vitiate or impair the title.\u201d\nBut it is proper here to consider, whether that act was constitutional and valid in whole or in part, and how far it can or may operate in favor of the plaintiff and in aid of the defendants\u2019 title. If Woodhull acquired the rights of the infant children when he purchased back the premises under the mortgage, a good title, as has been shown, could be conveyed to the defendants. If not, the question as to the validity and constitutionality of the legislative acts, becomes vitally important. It was certainly competent for the Legislature to relieve the daughters from the prohibition contained in the 63d section of the statute (1 R. S., 730), that no person beneficially interested in a trust for the receipt of the rents and profits of lands, can assign or in any manner dispose of such interest. The acts already referred to, provide for the conveyance of the rights of the daughters, and obviate any objection under the section just cited. So far then, they are constitutional and valid. \u25a0 But it is believed that these acts of the Legislature were valid, in all respects. It is urged, however, that they are unconstitutional and void; \"because the will being valid under the general laws of the State when made, no after legislation could alter or destroy its effect, and the Legislature could not divest the title or the contingent interests of persons not then in being.\nIn the case of Cochran v. Van Surlay (20 Wend., 365), the Court of Errors held, that a private act of the Legislature, authorizing the sale of the estate of infants for their maintenance and education, is within the scope of the legitimate authority of a State Legislature, and was constitutional. The Chancellor, in his opinion, doubted whether the Legislature could by special acts authorize a sale, so as to affect the contingent rights of persons not then in existence, and who might thereafter become entitled to the same, under the limitations in the will. That question was not, however, distinctly passed upon, as it was not necessary, the Chancellor observed, to a decision in that case. It appears to me, moreover, that the decision of the court necessarily disposed of the question. How could a sale be sanctioned, as was the one there, unless it cut off all contingent interests? The same objection was made to the title as is made here, and the court said the sale was valid and effectual.\nIn Powers v. Bergen (2 Seld., 358), this court held, that the Legislature (except in cases of necessity, arising from the infancy, insanity or other incompetency of those in whose behalf it acts) has no power to authorize by special act the sale of private property for other than public uses, without the consent of the owner. In that case no reason appeared, and the court said the existence of such necessity will not be presumed, when the facts which would create it are neither shown by proof nor recited in the statute. The present case is clearly distinguishable from that, inasmuch as the proceedings show that the property authorized to be sold consisted of vacant lots, which had never yielded any income since the death of the testator: that the property had been largely assessed for taxes, and had been sold for the non-payment, by reason of the want of means to pay them: that the certificate of the sales were held by purchasers, and were drawing rates of interest at fifteen per cent, and that unless redeemed, the equity of redemption would be lost: that the daughters and their children had no other property or estate, except a small income and annuity, for their support and education: that the New York property was the only productive property, and that, by reason of its dilapidated condition, required the expenditure of large sums of money for repairs: that the income derived from it was not sufficient for such repairs, and means could not be provided, unless by a sale of the Brooklyn lots. In Mrs. Leggett\u2019s case it had taken within $3,500 of one-quarter of the net income of the New York property for several years to pay the current expenses and charges upon it.\nUnder all these facts and circumstances it was certainly a wise provision, and calculated greatly to promote the future interests of the infant heirs, as well as the present rights of the daughters, to authorize a sale, as the Legislature did, if they possessed the power so to do. The strongest reasons existed for this course, and the case is entirely distinguishable from that in 2 Selden, 358. Indeed, that case would seem to sanction the proceedings here. The trustees held the premises in question, in trust for the use of the daughters during their lives, and the remainder was limited to their respective lawful issue, their heirs and assigns forever. Their children in esse at the time of the passage of the acts were all minors, and were seised in fee of the entire remainder, subject to open and let in after-born children, as to whom there was, of course, no vested interest; but each child as it was born would become seised of its proportionate share, as tenant in common with its brothers and sisters. (2 R. S., 723, 725, \u00a7\u00a7 9-13, 28, 30; Cochran v. Van Surlay, 20 Wend., 365; Hannan v. Osborn, 4 Paige, 336, 342; Nodine v. Greenfield, 7 Paige, 544; Moore v. Lyons, 25 Wend., 119, 143, 144.) Such children, not having any vested interest at the time of the sale, could have no claim upon the premises; but they would be entitled to receive their shares of the proceeds of sales, and of these the acts and the proceedings do not deprive them. The Legislature, as the sovereign, had the power, for good and sufficient reasons, to authorize and direct the sale of the interests of the cestuis que trust, and of the children in esse at the time of the passage of the acts. It has frequently exercised such power. (See act relating to Spingler's estate, Laws 1829, 567; act relating to Morris' estate, Laws 1853, 19; act relating to estate of T. B. Clarke, Laws 1814, ch. 78.)\nThe courts have established this power by judicial decisions, Clark v. Van Surlay (20 Wend., 365), and I think the Legislature also had the power to direct, as it did by the acts in question, a sale of the premises so'as to bind the interests of any posthumous children of the daughters, who on their birth would become interested in the remainder created by the will. Such children, when they came into existence, would be subject to then existing laws. They would be divested, as already remarked, of all claim upon the land, but would be entitled to their shares of the proceeds of the sales in the hands of the trustees. (Baker v. Lorillard, 4 Comst., 266, 267.) The Legislature is vested with all the powers of government which have not been expressly or impliedly delegated to other departments, and there are no restraints upon its power except such as are imposed by the Constitution. (3 Kern., 378; 20 Wend., 381; 15 N. Y., 543; and various other cases.) The acts in relation to the estate of Clarke, before cited,, were sustained by the courts on the ground, as I understand it, that the Legislature, in respect to persons acting under disability, acted as parens patriae.\nThe facts and circumstances in the present case show, that it was almost absolutely necessary to a protection of the interests of those entitled to a future interest in the premises and to prevent their entire loss. The power must exist somewhere, and it is necessarily in the Legislature,, to provide for their sale or disposition for the benefit of those concerned. See opinion of Johnson, J., in Jackson v. Babcock (16 N. Y., 246, 249), and of Denio, J., in Towle v. Forney (14 N. Y., 423), where the decision of the Court of Errors in Cochran v. Van Surlay (20 Wend., 365) was upheld upon the principle of stare decisis; both which cases are, I think, conclusive. The acts of the Legislature made it requisite that the court should order and confirm the sale, if, in its opinion, it would be for-the best interest of the cestuis que trust and their children, whether then in being or not. All the proceedings have been in strict conformity with the acts. The rights of all have been carefully and fully protected. No injustice has been done, but on the contrary great benefits have been secured, as well to all those in full life whose rights are concerned, as to any who may have or be hereafter entitled to any interest. In my judgment a conveyance to the purchasers under the sales will carry the entire fee, against after-born children as well as those existing. These views lead to the conclusion that the purchasers will acquire a valid title to the premises in question by the execution and delivery of the deeds, which have been tendered; and the judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.\nAll the judges concurred: and the court, by independent, majorities on each point, affirmed the validity of the deed on both grounds; as an execution of the trustee\u2019s power under the will, and as being effectual, irrespective of that question under the act of the Legislature.\nJudgment affirmed,"},{"case_name":"Thomas J. Howard, Executor, in Equity, versus The American Peace Society, & als.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/621798\/","date":"1860-01-01","court":"Maine Supreme Judicial Court","content":"The opinion of the Court was drawn up by\nTenney, C. J.\nOn May 29, 1850, Edward Crafts, of Auburn, executed his last will and testament, in which he made certain devises and bequests, as set forth specifically in the bill, and appointed the plaintiff the executor of the same.\nOn June 15, 1852, the will was admitted to probate by the Judge of Probate, for the County of Cumberland, as the last will of said Edward Crafts, and the plaintiff was duly appointed executor thereof, and entered upon the discharge of his trust by giving bond according to law.\nAn appeal was taken by some of the heirs at law of the testator, from the decree of the Judge of Probate, approving said will, to the Supreme Judicial Court, and they prosecuted their appeal therein, upon which such proceedings were had that the instrument was adjudged and decreed to be the last will and testament of Edward Crafts.\nThis is a bill in equity brought by the executor, as such, in which he prays that the respective rights and interests of the parties claiming under the will may be adjusted and determined ; and he shows that he has proceeded in the settlement of the estate, and holds in his hands a balance amounting to the sum stated in the bill that remains to be distributed, after paying all the claims, which have been presented against the estate, and that, at the decease of the testator, he was seized and possessed of certain parcels of real estate, situate in the State of Maine, as described in the inventory of the estate.\nAnd the plaintiff says, that, owing to the uncertain terms in which the will of the testator is expressed, the intention of the testator is a matter of doubt, and that he cannot safely pay over or deliver to any person or corporations the legacies and bequests named in the will, until it is settled, upon a full examination of the several matters, who is justly entitled thereto.\nThe plaintiff charges, that the \"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,\u201d a corporation, whose office is at Boston, claim to be the legatees named in the first clause in said will, wherein one-third part of the personal property of the testator is bequeathed to the \"Congregational Foreign Missionary Society.\u201d And that the Ameri can Peace Society,\u201d a corporation, whose office is at Boston, claim one-third part of said personal estate, under the second clause of the will. And the plaintiff and others, selectmen and overseers of the poor of the town of Auburn, claim that they* or some trustee, to be appointed by the Court for that purpose, are entitled to one-sixth part of said personal estate, under the third clause of the will, to hold the same in trust for the suffering poor of the town of Auburn, or that the executor should hold the same as trustee to execute the trust aforesaid; and the plaintiff further shows, that the \"First Congregational Society in Auburn,\u201d a religious society, incorporated under the provisions of the statutes of Maine, claim to be the devisee in fee, under the fourth clause of the will. And that Rev. John Elliot of Auburn, and the Rev. Thomas N. Lord, each, severaljy claim to be the residuary legatee under the last clause of the will. And the plaintiff further charges that Martha Howard, and others named, claim as heirs at law of the testator, that some or all of the devises and bequests in the will are invalid and void for uncertainty, and that they are entitled to a residue of said estate, which they claim as\u2019 not having been specifically devised or bequeathed by any valid and certain provision in the will.\nNone of the heirs at law of the testator are named in the will as devisees and legatees therein. The heirs at law are not to be disinherited by conjecture, but only by express words, or necessary implication. Thomas v. Thomas, 6 Term Rep. 671.\nIt is perceived, from the foregoing, that the \"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions\u201d claim the bequest made to the \"Congregational Foreign Missionary Society,\u201d and that the-\" First Congregational Society in Auburn \u201d insist that that society is intended by the name of the \"Congregational Society of Auburn,\u201d as it appears in the will, and that John Elliott and Thomas N. Lord, severally claim to be residuary legatees in the will, as the Congregational minister of the aforesaid society, of the town of Auburn. And that the selectmen and overseers of the poor of Auburn are the trustees, to represent the \"suffering poor of said Auburn,\u201d as the cestuis que trust.\nCertain legal rules have been adopted by Courts in such cases-, as are here presented, touching the admission and exclusion of parol evidence, to aid in giving a construction to devises and bequests in a will, and the effect of - such evidence- as is competent.\nIn the case of Miller v. Travers, 8 Bing., 244, it is said, by Tvndal, J., \u2014 \"It may be admitted, that in all cases in which a difficulty arises, in applying the words of a will to the thing which is the subject matter of the devise, or to the person of the devisee, the difficulty or ambiguity which is introduced by the admission of extrinsic evidence, may be rebutted and removed by the production of further evidence upon the same subject, calculated to explain what was the estate or subject matter really intended to be devised, or who was the person really intended to take under the will; and this appears to us to be the extent of the maxim, \" Ambiguitas verborum latius, verifications suppletur.\u201d But the cases to which this construction applies will be found to range themselves into two separate classes, distinguishable from each other. The first is where the description of the thing devised, or of the devisee, is clear upon the face of the will; but, upon the death of the testator, it is found that there are more than one estate or subject matter of devise, or more than one person, whose description follows out and fills the words used in the will. As where the testator devises his manor of Dale, and, at his death, it is found that he has two manors of that name, South Dale and North Dale; or, where a man devises to his son John, and he has two sons of that name. In each of these cases respectively, parol evidence is admissible to show which man- or was intended to pass, and which son was intended to take. The other class of cases is that in which the description contained in the will of the thing intended to be devised, or of the person who is intended to take, is true in part but not in every particular. As when an estate is devised, called A, and is described as in the occupation of B, and it is found that, though there is an estate called A, yet the whole is not in the occupation of B; or, where an estate is devised to a person whoso surname or Christian name is mistaken, or whose description is imperfect or inaccurate; in which latter class of cases, parol evidence is admissible to show what estate was intended to pass, and who was the devisee intended to take, provided there is sufficient indication of intention appearing on the face of the will to justify the application of the evidence.\u201d\nThe foregoing rules are supported by the authority of cases previously adjudged. In Dean v. Page, referred to in the case of Hay v. Earl of Coventry, the Court held, \"that sufficient did not appear on the face of the will, to warrant them in saying that an estate of inheritance was given to the daughter; that, if it were left to conjecture, they might suppose that some mistake might be made in the limitation, but they would not determine on conjecture, or put into the testator\u2019s mouth what he had not said.\u201d\nIn 4 Russ. Rep., 581, it was held that \"evidence of collateral circumstances was admissible, as of the ages of several devisees named in the will; of the fact of their being married, or unmarried and the like, for the purpose of ascertaining the true construction of the will. But it is very clear that such evidence is not admitted to introduce new words into the will itself, but merely to give a construction to the words used in the will consistent with the real state of his property and family. The evidence is introduced to prove facts, which, according to the language of Lord Coke, 8 Rep., 155, stand well with the words of the will.\u201d\nIt is a maxim of the law in such matters that falsa demonstratio non nooet, \"but,\u201d says Lord Kenton, in Thomas v. Thomas, before cited, \"I have always understood, \u25a0 that such falsa demonstradlo should be added to that which was sufficiently certain before.\u201d\nThe rule laid down by Anderson, C. J., in Gadb. Rep., 131, is, \"an averment to take away surplusage is good, but not to increase that which is defective in the will of the testator.\u201d\nThe cases of Standen v. Standen, 2 Vesey, Jun., 589, and Selwood v. Mildmay, 3 Vesey, Jun., 306, illustrate the rules which have been referred to, where parol evidence is admissible.\nIn the case of Beaumont v. Fell, the name of the legatee was mistaken. The testator gave a legacy to Catherine ; it turned out there was a person whom he frequently called Gatty, and not according to her real name, which was Gertrude; and, when parol evidence of that was received, it left no doubt but that the testator meant Gatty. Thomas v. Thomas, before cited, 676, 677.\nIt is said, in Miller v. Travers, 8 Bing., 244, \"an uncertainty which arises from the applying the description contained in the will to the thing devised, or to the person of the devisee, may be helped by parol evidence; but that a new subject matter of devise, of a new devisee, when the will is entirely silent upon either, cannot be imported by parol evidence into the will itself.\u201d\nIn the case of Allen v. Allen, 12 Adolph. & Ellis, 451, it was held that parol evidence of the declarations of the devisor, that she had left her property to her grandson, who had only one brother and sister, were admissible to show which grandson should take under the devise. And it was no objection to such evidence, that the declarations were subsequent to the making of the will. In the opinion of the Court, Lord Denman, C. J., says, \u2014 \"It is within the very terms of the only case in which, according to the opinion of the Court of Exchequer, thrown out in their judgment in Doe dem, Hiscocks v. Hiscocks, declarations of the testator can be received in evidence of intention. In the Whole list of cases on this subject, no one can be found in which stick evidence, under such circumstances, has been excluded.\u201d\nIt is believed that the authorities in this country, which have been relied upon by both sides in argument, are in harmony with the English doctrine on this subject, which has been adverted to in the cases cited. In the case of Tucker & als., Ex\u2019rs, v. Seaman\u2019s Aid Society & als., 7 Met., 188, where the same matter is very fully discussed by C. J. Shaw, with his usual ability, in giving the opinion of the Court, he says, \u2014 \"In general, no extrinsic evidence of the intention of the testator is admissible to control or alter the written provisions of a will. It would be contrary to the general rule of the common law, viz.: that when a party has expressed his contract or his testament in writing, duly executed, such writing is in its nature better evidence of his intentions than any extrinsic evidence could be. But another and more conclusive reason is, that the law requires a will to be executed in the presence of three witnesses, and with other solemnities, calculated to insure correctness and guard against mistake and imposition.\u201d\nAgain, it is said in the same case, \"the general rule certainly is, that the intent of the testator is to govern in the construction ; but it is the intention expressed by the will, and not otherwise. To get at the intention expressed by the will, every clause and word are to be taken into consideration, because one clause is often modified and explained by another; every implication and every direct provision is to be regarded. And further; as a will must necessarily apply to things external, any evidence may be given of facts and circumstances which have any tendency to give effect and operation to the words of the will; such as the names, descriptions and designations of persons, the relations in which they stood to the testator, the facts of his life, as having been single or married one or more times, having had children by one or more wives, their names, ages, places of residence, occupation; so of grandchildren, brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, and all similar facts. If' then, when the will comes to be thus, applied, there is no reasonable doubt as to the person and things intended, there is no room for any further admission of evidence to show the in tent of the testator.\u201d \"If, in the matter of description, there is a mistake, that is, if there is no one who corresponds to the description, in all particulars, but there is one who corresponds in many particulars, and no other who can be intended, such person will take.\u201d\n\"Still, however, there is a well defined class of cases, wherein extrinsic evidence of the actual intention of the testator is admissible, which is that of equivocation or latent ambiguity.\u201d \" But when the will clearly describes a particular estate, and names a person in being, who is the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, it was early held as a legal construction of the statute, that, from the necessity of the case, extrinsic evidence must be admitted to show which was intended.\u201d\n\" The principle established by the cases is, that the estate must pass by the will. If the will applies definitely to two or more persons, so that either would be entitled to take it, under the will, but for the existence and claim of the other, then parol evidence is admissible to prove which was intended. When that proof is supplied, the will 'operates' by its own force and terms, to give the property to that one as if such person had been the only one named or described. The evidence does not create the gift, but simply directs it.\u201d It remains to apply these principles to the devises and bequests in the will, and to the legal evidence in the case.\nThe bequest to the \"American Peace Society,\u201d is to a body corporate of that name, which existed at the time the will was executed, and, for aught which appears to the contrary, continues its existence to the present time. No question is made of the right of this corporation to take under the will, but all interested in that legacy consent thereto.\nThe \"First Congregational Society in Auburn\u201d appears to have been formed as a corporation by virtue of the stat-* ute of 1841, c. 18, \u00a7 1, in the year 1844. It is objected, however, in behalf of the heirs at law of the testator, that the first meeting was not held according to the provisions of that Act, inasmuch as the place and time of that meeting was not named in the notice therefor. On inspection of the records, this objection does not rest upon any fact. The return of the notice given by the person directed to notify the parties interested, refers to another paper, and that paper was the warrant, manifestly on the same sheet on which the return was made. By authority of the statute, the warrant and the return of notice, the meeting was held and the parish organized, pursuant to the statute, under the name of the \"First Congregational Parish in Auburn.\u201d In the constitution subsequently adopted and signed by the members of the parish, according to the statute, the corporation was to be known as the \" First Congregational Society in Auburn.\u201d The records of this society, of which copies have been introduced from its first formation, to the latter part of the year 1858, show that the organization has been kept up, and the existence of the society continued. And it appears also, that on May 29, 1850, the day on which the will was executed, the society had a place for regular meetings and of worship.\nThe evidence shows that, at the time of the execution of the will, there was no other Congregational society in the town of Auburn, excepting the one referred to in the copies of the records. There being no other claimant for this bequest, the case is analogous to that of Minot & al., Ex\u2019rs., v. The Boston Asylum and Farm School for Indigent Boys & als., 7 Met., 416, where the defendants were held to be entitled to the devises and bequests made to the \" Boys\u2019 Asylum and Farm School.\u201d \"The First Congregational Society in Auburn \u201d are adjudged and decreed to have been intended by the testator in the bequest to the \" Congregational Society of Auburn,\u201d and are entitled to take accordingly.\nIt is proved that the \" American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,\u201d is a corporation, created by the Legislature of Massachusetts more than thirty-five years ago, having its principal place of business in Boston, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and has done a large amount of business; has'been employed, to obtain and receive donations, and to appropriate them to impart the Holy Scriptures to unevangelized nations, and for the support of persons to teach and preach the gospel in foreign lands, and to labor there as missionaries, and for' purposes connected therewith. That the society has, during that time, by its own agents, by ministers of the gospel, and others, made known extensively its proceedings and Wants, and has solicited donations and received bequests from Congregational churches and societies-, and their members. That there did not exist within the United States, on or before May 29, 1850, any society or association, known or designated as the \" Congregational Foreign Missionary Society;\u201d and that the American Board has received donations- from the Orthodox Congregational societies in Auburn, Lewiston, and Minot.\nIt is further proved, that the plaintiff in this bill prepared the will, which was executed by the testator on May 29, 1850, \u2014 that, before that time, he and the testator had known of the existence of a society and its proceedings, as employed to obtain and receive donations from Congregational societies or churches, or from their members, and to appropriate them to the support of foreign missions, so far that a collection for the support of foreign missions was-taken up monthly in the \"Congregational Society in Auburn,\u201d and the wants and proceedings of such society had been made known publicly to the Congregational societies in Auburn and Minot; that the Congregational meeting house in Auburn was distant from the testator\u2019s residence about seventy-five rods, and a part of the time about twenty rods; the meeting house in Minot about three miles, and the meeting house in Lewiston five or six miles from the testator\u2019s residence. .That the plaintiff and testator, before the execution of the will, had had- conversation together touching' such society and its proceedings, which was known to the latter. That the plaintiff had no knowledge of any other society as soliciting and receiving donations from Con-. gregational societies, or their members, for the support of foreign missions, nor did he know that the testator had any such knowledge. That the plaintiff was desired by the testator to insert a clause in his said will for the purpose of giving one-third of all his personal property to the society, whose proceeding's, as before mentioned, had become known to him, and, in compliance with such desire, the plaintiff did insert the first bequest in said will as it was executed by him. That, at that time, the corporate name of such society had not been made known to the plaintiff, nor did he know that the testator had knowledge thereof. That, at the time the plaintiff drew the will of the testator, the testator spoke of the foreign missionary cause as being a worthy object, and \"what money he had, he said, he thought he had a right to dispose of as he thought proper; he also spoke of the \" Congregational Foreign Missionary Society \u201d in contradistinction to the missionary societies of the Methodists and the Baptists, which he named.\nFrom this evidence alone, we should\u2019 entertain no doubt that the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions was intended by the testator. But it is shown that the form of church government in the Calvinistic Baptist churches is congregational, and that among them arc two Foreign Missionary Societies, one at the North and another at the South. The former, called the \"Baptist Missionary Union,\u201d has existed many years and has for its object a work very similar to that of the \"American Board\u201d; but we are satisfied, from the evidence, that it has never boon styled a \"Congregational Foreign Missionary Society;\u201d nor are their churches known by the name of \"Congregational churches.\u201d It has been further shown that there is in New York a corporation called the \"American Missionary Association,\u201d having for its object the receiving and distributing of moneys, contributed for missionary purposes in this country, and in foreign lands, for the publication of a paper entitled the \"American Missionary,\u201d and other papers and pamphlets of a missionary character, and for the propagation of the gospel of Christ, in its peaceful and anti-slavery character. The principal place of business is in New York. That it was a voluntary association from Sept., 1846, to Feb. 1, 1849, when it became a body corporate; that it has transacted a large amount of business yearly; that, since its incorporation and before, it has been employed to obtain and receive donations, and to appropriate them to impart the Holy Scriptures to unevangelized nations, and to support persons to teach and preach the gospel in foreign countries, and to labor there as missionaries; and that it has procured the scriptures to be distributed and the gospel to be preached in this country as in foreign and unevangelized ones. That, during the period mentioned, the association, by its own agents, ministers of the gospel and other persons, have made known extensively through the whole of the free States, excepting California, and some of the slave States, the employment of the association, and has solicited donations from Congregational societies and churches, and received donations and bequests from their churches and societies. That, before May 29, 1850, the association had received donations from persons in North Auburn, the sum of two dollars and fifty cents ; and, from persons and Congregational churches and societies in a large number of other towns in the State of Maine, other donations. That the donation from Lewis-ton Falls was from the \"Female Anti-Slavery Society,\u201d in Sept., 1848, and consisted of clothing, valued at seven dollars. That soon after the organization, in 1846, the association began to publish and has ever since continued to publish a monthly paper, called the American Missionary, setting forth, among other things, the objects, doings and necessities of the association, which has been extensively circulated.\nIt is very manifest that, at the t\u00fane of dictating his will, the- testator did not intend that the bequest to the \" Congregational Foreign Missionary Society,\u201d should be for the benefit of any Methodist or Baptist society, inasmuch as the subject of this bounty was expressly contra-distinguished from the latter societies.\nBut it is insisted, that there is an uncertainty whether the American Board, or the American Missionary Association was intended by the testator, in the clause which we are now considering, to such an extent, that the bequest must be treated as void for that reason.\nThis, then, may be regarded as a case where the name used in the will does not designate with precision any person or corporation. We must then apply the rule before adverted to, that \"when the circumstances come to be proved, so many of them concur to indicate that a particular person was intended, and no similar conclusive circumstances appear to distinguish and identify any other person, the person thus shown to be intended will take.\u201d\nIt is very clearly proved that, before the execution of the will, the testator had known of a society and its proceedings, which obtained donations from Congregational churches, to support foreign missions, and that monthly collections were taken in the Congregational society in Auburn, and that the wants and proceedings of such society had been made public in the Congregational societies of Auburn and Minot, both of which were near the residence of the testator ; that he had spoken of the proceedings and wants of such society, for the benefit of which he caused the bequest, that we are now considering, to be inserted in the will. And it is proved that the American Board had received, before May 29, 1850, for many years, donations from the churches and societies in Auburn, Lewiston and Minot, thus identifying the society whose wants and proceedings had been made known to the testator, with that board.\nNo evidence is adduced that the testator had any knowledge of the \"American Missionary Association,\u201d or a society corresponding therewith, in its objects and efforts.\nIt is very manifest that the testator entertained the intention to bestow his bounty upon a missionary society, whose purpose was to spread the gospel in foreign countries. This is the distinguishing object of the American Board, and, from the evidence, we infer, that the legitimate opera tio.ns of that society are confined thereto. On the other hand, .the American Missionary Association has the purpose of propagating the gospel, not only in foreign lands., but in .our own country, \"in its peaceful and anti-slavery character.\u201d Hence, with greater propriety .can the American Board be called a \".Foreign Missionary Society,\u201d than can the \"Missionary Association.\u201d We have no evidence that the testator was .disposed to appropriate means for home missionary enterprises, or for -the lessening of the evils of slavery.\nWhen all the evidence is examined, we cannot doubt that the \"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions \u201d was the society intended by the testator as the legatee, in the first bequest in his will, being a body corporate, well known in its various -action for foreign -missionary purposes, -though its corporate name had not come to his knowledge. And it is adjudged and decreed accordingly.\nThe third bequest in the will, \"unto the suffering poor of the town of Auburn,\u201d though not the subject of argument, in behalf of the persons referred to, demands the attention of -the .Court. In the preamble of the statute of 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, generally denominated the statute of charitable uses, among the uses enumerated as charitable, are gifts, jdeyises, Ac., for the relief .of aged, impotent and poor people. And jt has been decided in -this State, that the general provisions of this :statufe are in force here. The jurisdiction, however, of this Court, over trusts, is derived from R. S. of 1841, c. 96, \u00a7 10, and R. S. of 1857, c. 77, \u00a7 8, and hence the provisions of the statute of Elizabeth are not the basis of the equity power in cases .of trusts, and the Court is not restricted thereby, but the statute is rather incorporated into .our chancery jurisprudence. Tappan v. Deblois, 45 Maine, 122,\nIs this bequest void for uncertainty, and does it fail because no person is named in fhe will as having the express power to execute the trust implied ? It cannot be doubted, that the testator, at the time he dictated his will, had in his mind a distinct class' of persons, who should be the objects of his bounty, as their necessities, expressed in the will, should from time to time be disclosed. And this class, in his contemplation, was composed of those who should be compelled to submit to privations, but who were not expected by him to seek or receive relief under the pauper laws of the State. If he had reference to the class last referred to, the bequest would really be to the town of Auburn, in its corporate capacity, and would not be for the benefit of those, who, from feelings of sensibility or other causes, would prefer want, to some extent, to aid from public charity, and who were really intended by him. This provision in the will was the result of a laudable desire to supply the wants of those in a humble pecuniary condition, and prevent the necessity for a call upon the municipal authorities to relieve their sufferings; and should not fail, unless for substantial reasons.\nThe case of Attorney General v. Syamfer, 1 Vern., 224, was where the testator gave \u00a31000 to such charitable purposes as he had, by another writing, directed. The paper referred to was lost, so that the bequest stood as a gift to charitable uses. The trust was established, and the direction to a particular object left with the king, as parens patriae.\nAnn Cane made her will, and, after making several bequests therein, gave all the rest and residue of her personal property unto James Vaston, to such charitable uses as he should appoint, recommending poor clergymen who had large families and good moral characters. James Vaston died in the lifetime of the testatrix. The charity was sustained and executed by the Court, the Lord Chancellor saying, \"the most general gift to charitable purposes has been decreed to be carried into execution, and the trustee, not being alive to administer the charity, cannot defeat the intention. Here she has pointed out clergymen' as the objects of her bounty, which is sufficiently distinct.\u201d Moggridge v. Thackwell & als., 3 Bro. C. C., 517.\nThe case of White v. White & al., 1 Bro. C. C., 12, was where the testator gave a moiety of the residue of his property to such lying-in hospital as his executor should appoint. The Lord Chancellor remarked, \u2014 \"I remember to have read a case somewhere, where a legacy was given to B, for the benefit of non-conforming ministers, with the advice of C and D. At the testator\u2019s death, B, C and D were all dead, yet the Court sustained the legacy.\u201d And it was referred to a master to. see unto which of the lying-in hospitals it was fit it should be paid.\nA bequest was made to the poor inhabitants of St. Leonards, and the trust was supported. Attorney General v. Clark, Ambler, 422. The same was done where the gift was to poor dissenting ministers, living in any county. Waller v. Childs, Ambler, 524.\nThe Court of Chancery will aid a defective conveyance to legal charitable uses. Case of Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge, 1 W. Black., 91.\nThe same general question was considered by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, when the District, which is now the State of Maine-, was a part of that Commonwealth, in the case of Bartlett & al. v. King, 12 Mass., 537. And it was held, that a bequest to promote the propagation of Christianity among the heathen, to persons who at the time constituted a voluntary association, and in trust for pious -and charitable uses, was not void, as against public policy, for uncertainty,- nor for the reason that there was no Court in Massachusetts at that time to compel the execution of such\u201d a trust. It was remarked, by Dewey, J., who delivered the opinion of the Court, that \"it does not seem to be necessary that there should be any particular or certain persons designated, who are strictly cestui que trust, in the common use of the term.\u201d \"In trusts of this kind, the individuals who are ultimately benefited, are always uncertain. All the certainty required is a general description or limitation, and not a particular description of the individuals. On this ground, therefore, we do not perceive any more difficulty in giving effect to the bequest, than exists in all cases, of donations to charitable uses; whether given to trustees directly, or in trust for other trustees, to be expended in promoting the objects for which they are given.\u201d\nGoing v. Emery, 16 Pick., 107, was a case where a residue of the testator\u2019s estate, after making certain devises and bequests, was bequeathed to the cause of Christ, for the benefit and promotion of true evangelical piety and religion. It was held that, by virtue of the statute of 43 Eliz., c. 4, the devise was not void for uncertainty.\nThe will of the late Mary Preble was before this Court, in the case of Deering v. Adams, 37 Maine, 264, and in a certain contingency the estate of the testatrix was given and appropriated to constitute a fund, the interest of which was to be applied for the benefit of the poor of Portland and vicinity. This part of the will is adverted to in the opinion of the Court, and no suggestion made that the devise would be void for uncertainty.\nThe authorities, which have been referred to, well sustain the bequest to the suffering poor of the town of Auburn; so that it cannot be treated as void for uncertainty.\nWe now advert to the other inquiry, whether this bequest must fail because no trustee is named in the will, and because there is no indication that one should be appointed to take charge of the fund. Assuming this to be true, the authorities cited fully establish the doctrine, that the bequest shall not therefore fail, and in addition, on this point, we refer to the following: \u2014Saunderson v. Stearns, 6 Mass., 37 ; Stone v. Hobart, 8 Pick., 464; Hall v. Cushing, 9 Pick., 395; Hash v. Cutler, 19 Pick., 67.\nAn important question is now presented in relation to the duty of the plaintiff, as the executor of the will, touching this bequest. The donation is limited to a class of persons who are designated in such a mode that they can be ascertained by their pecuniary condition alone. To make the provision effectual, some one must perform this duty. Persons may be found in the town of Auburn, who would be legitimately embraced in the provision, and such may be their situation, that the relief from their sufferings might require the whole amount referred to in the will. In such case, the entire legacy might not be improperly distributed at once. But if this should not be found to be the state of this class of individuals, no violence is done to the language of the will by giving it such a construction, that the fund provided may be invested and the income distributed according to the. testator\u2019s general direction; or, if no persons should be found answering to his description of persons, the fund might accumulate.\nThe statute provides, in c. 87, \u00a7 8, head 7, that this Court have equity jurisdiction to determine the construction of wills, and whether an executor, not expressly appointed a trustee, becomes such from the provisions of the will. It is very manifest that some designation of individuals must be made. If this is not to be done by the executor, it must be by a person appointed a trustee, to execute the trust.\nIn looking at the whole will, and to the evidence in the case, it cannot be doubted that the testator had confidence in the ability, judgment and discretion of his executor. If it should be found that it would be proper, in the opinion of the executor, for the reasons before stated, that this donation should be passed at once to the suffering poor of the town of Auburn, he might, with propriety, discharge his duty by the distribution of the whole sum. If otherwise, he might make the investment and distribute the income and, perhaps, a portion of the principal, till the aggregate should reach the whole, as circumstances might require. And we are of the opinion that the testator intended that his executor should execute this trust.\nWe have seen that two individuals claim as residuary legatees under the will, each the whole of the residuum, as the \"Congregational minister\u201d of the \"Congregational Society of Auburn.\u201d\nIt appears from the evidence that no one was holding such a relation to that society, in any sense of the term, at the time the will was executed. Hence, the testator cannot be supposed to have had in his mind any particular individual. And it follows from this that this provision had respect to a time then future, when there should be a minister of that society; and, it being absolute and subject to no contingency, whenever it should vest, it must apply to the one who should be the minister of the society, and who should first become such in the legal sense of the term.\nThe Rev. John Elliot claims this legacy. It appears, by evidence in the case, that he commenced to preach to that society the first of March, 1850, and continued to do so, till about the first of August, 1851. The only reference to him in the records of the society, is a vote passed at its meeting on August 24, 1850, which is as follows: \u2014 \"Voted, that we instruct our committee to extend an invitation to Rev. Mr. Hawes, to preach two Sabbaths, also employ Rev. (Mr.) Elliot to preach until we can obtain some other man, or until we can agree on some other person to settle with us.\u201d It cannot be supposed that Mr. Elliot was the minister of the society, in the opinion of the testator, for, if he were such, the bequest, it would seem, would be made to him by name, as Mr. Elliot was employed there when the will was executed.\nRev. Thomas N. Lord also claims, as residuary legatee, under the will. The evidence shows that he was the acting pastor of the church and society of the \"First Congregational Society in Auburn,\u201d for six years preceding July, 1857, and the settled pastor since October, 1858, and that he was installed as such on October 27, 1858. By the records of the society it appears, that the society was duly notified that a meeting thereof would be holden on October 13, 1851, and one article was to see if the parish will coincide with the First Congregational Church in Auburn, in extending a call to Rev. Thomas N. Lord, to become their pastor. And, at the meeting so notified, it was voted to concur with the First Congregational Church in Auburn in extending a call to Rev, Thomas N. Lord to become their pastor.\nThe records show also, that, upon proper notice, a meeting of the society was held on Oct. 19, 1858, to act upon the following articles in the call, among others, \u2014 \"To see if the society will concur with the church, in extending a call to Rev. Thomas N. Lord, to become their pastor,\u201d and \"to see if the society will choose a committee to act in concert with the committee in calling a council for installation of the Rev. Thomas N. Lord.\u201d And it was voted, that the society concur with the church in extending a call to Rev. Thomas N. Lord to become their pastor, and chose C. S. Packard a committee in behalf of the society to act in concert with the committee in calling a council for the installation of the Rev. Thomas N. Lord.\nIt appears further from the records, that a meeting of the society was duly called, to be holden on Dec. 25, 1854, and, among other things, was the article in the call to see if' they will give their agent, Mr. Asa Holmes, any further instructions relative to the late Edward Crafts\u2019 bequest, made and pertaining to the minister of the First Congregational Society of Auburn, and at the meeting it was voted, \u2014 \"Agreeably to notice, instructed Mr. Asa Holmes, agent of said society, to present the claims of Rev. T. N. Lord, to the proper authorities, in behalf of the bequest to him., by the late Edward Crafts of Auburn, deceased.\u201d\nThe records disclose no invitation to any other person to become the pastor of the church and society, or either, from the date of the will to the installation of Mr. Lord, and there is nothing in the records, or evidence, that, during that time, any other person was recognized by the church or society as being the minister of that society.\nRev. Thomas N. Lord, we think, is entitled to take under this clause of the will, and it is so decreed.\nRice, Appleton, Goodenow, Davis and Kent, JL, concurred."},{"case_name":"State (Herrick, relator) v. Richardson","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/458949\/","date":"1860-06-01","court":"New Hampshire Supreme Court","content":"Bellows, J.\nIt is a well settled doctrine of the common law, that the father is entitled to the custody of his minor children, as against the mother and every body else; that he is bound for their maintenance and nurture, and has the corresponding right to their obedience and their services. 2 Story\u2019s Eq., secs. 1343-1350; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 193; 1 Bl. Com. 453; Jenness v. Emerson, 15 N. H. 486; Huntoon v. Hazelton, 20 N. H. 389. By statute of 12 Car. 2, ch. 24, he may, by will, appoint guardians for his infant children, who will thereby become entitled to their custody and tuition until they reach the age of twenty-one years. This act has been adopted in this State, and under it testamentary guardians may be appointed. Balch v. Smith, 12 N. H. 437; Copp v. Copp, 20 N. H. 284. This power of the'father is, however, regarded as a trust, confided to him by the law, upon the presumption that the natural affection of the parent will ensure its faithful execution. He is, in truth, the guardian by nature of his child, and, like other guardians, may, for inability or unfaithfulness, be displaced, and the trust conferred upon another. In England this power is exercised by the king as the Parens Patriae, acting through the court of chancery. De Manneville v. De Manneville, 10 Ves. 51, eases cited, and notes. In this State a court of chancery has probably a like power, notwithstanding the jurisdiction conferred upon the probate court to appoint guardians \u201c whenever there shall be occasion.\u201d Comp. Stat. 384, secs. 1, 4; 2 Story\u2019s Eq., ch. 35, 75, and 2 Fonbl. Eq. 225. And the question, then, is, whether the father, under the circumstances of this case, is entitled to the custody of his child, and if so, whether under this process that custody can be awarded to him ?\nThe object of the writ of habeas corpus, in a general sense, is to release a party from illegal restraint; and, when such party has arrived at years of discretion \u2014 is sui juris, nothing more is done.\nBut in the case of an infant, too young to decide for itself, the court must of necessity determine where it shall be placed, and, in doing so, must determine to whom the custody belongs. If withheld from that custody, it is deemed to be unlawfully restrained, and when restored by virtue of this process, is deemed to be set at liberty.\nThe power of the court on habeas corpus to determine the right of custody, and, in proper cases, to award accordingly, is well established by adjudged cases in both the English and American courts. On this point many of the English decisions are collected and considered in Queen v. Clark, 7 El. & Black. 186, 90 E. C. L. 185. In truth, this jurisdiction in England has been uniformly affirmed, although there has been controversy in respect to the exercise of the discretion of the court when called upon to change the custody of an infant. But the power has been conceded from an early date, as appears from Rex v. Delaval, 3 Burr. 1434, and cases cited. To the same effect are The People v. Mercein, 3 Hill (N. Y.) 399, and cases cited; Commonwealth v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203; Mayne v. Baldwin, 1 Halst. Ch. 454; Armstrong v. Stone, 9 Graft. 102; State v. Clover, 1 Harr. (N. J.) 419. It is true, that when the person entitled already has the custody, but has abused the trust, the remedy may not be in this form. But in this ease the father, and natural guardian of the child, is seeking by this process to have it restored to his custody, and we are required to determine whether, in the exercise of a sound discretion, the custody of the child ought, or ought not to he awarded to the father.\nIn determining this question the court will take into consideration the right of the father, his ability and inclination to perform faithfully the trust imposed upon him, the present condition of the child, and, if of years of discretion, its wishes upon the subject. Prima fade, however, the right of custody is in the father; and when the application is resisted upon the ground that he is unfit for the trust, by reason of grossly immoral conduct, harsh usage of his child, or other cause, a proper regard to the sanctity of the parental relation will require that the objection be sustained by clear and satisfactory proofs. Commonwealth v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203.\nThe discretion to be exercised is not an arbitrary one, but, in the absence of any positive disqualification of the father for the proper discharge of his parental duties, he has, as it seems to us, a paramount right to the custody of his infant child, which no court is at liberty to disregard. And while we are bound also to regard the permanent interests and welfare of the child, it is to be presumed that its interests and welfare will be best promoted by continuing that guardianship which the law has provided, until it is made plainly to appear that the father is no longer worthy of the trust. People v. Mercein, 25 Wend. 72. The breaking of the ties which bind the father and the child can never be justified without the most solid and substantial reasons. Upon the father the child must mainly depend for support, education and advancement in life, and as security for this he has the obligation of law as well as the promptings of that parental affection which rarely fail to bring into the service of the child the best energies and the most thoughtful care of the father. In any form of proceeding the sundering of these ties will always be approached by the courts with great caution, ' and with a deep sense of responsibility.\nIn the case before us, the child, a female, was ten years old in February last, and is quite intelligent and well educated, for her years; and it appears that for nearly the whole of her life she has resided in the - family of the respondent, and that it is her wish to remain there. It also appears that the respondent, the maternal uncle of the child, and his family, consisting of his mother and an unmarried sister, are in every way suitable persons to have the charge of such a child, and that it has been treated by them uniformly with great kindness, and that between the child and the family there exists a strong mutual affection. On the other hand, there is no evidence of the unfitness of the father for the proper discharge of his parental duties toward the child, or of the want of proper parental affection, but the evidence shows both the father and uncle to be highly respectable clergymen of the same religious sect, both suitable persons to have the charge of such a child, and, so far as the evidence goes, having equal means.\nUnder these circumstances, and upon the principles we have stated, we are satisfied that the father is entitled to the custody of the child, and that, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, we are not at liberty to allow his right to be controlled by the wishes of a child of such tender years.\nThe father is the guardian by nature, and also for nurture. In case of his death, without a testamentary guardian being appointed, the mother is, by the English law, the guardian for nurture. Queen v. Clark, before cited. This guardianship for nurture, \u2014 which means to educate, to bring up, to train, \u2014 continues to the age of fourteen years; and during that time such guardian has necessarily the right to the custody of the child, and it could with no propriety be assumed that the child had during that period sufficient discretion to decide for itself on the question of its custody; and so it is distinctly held in Queen v. Clark, where, in the very able opinion of Lord Campbell, C. J., the authorities on this point are cited and examined.\nIn that case the child, a girl, was ten years and seven months old, and had been placed by the Commissioners of the Poyal Patriotic Eund, on the death of its father, a sergeant of marines who was killed in the service during the Crimean war, at a Protestant school in the care of the respondent ; and she was placed there, with the assent of the mother, in 1855, and the writ of habeas corpus was issued on the 2d day of January, 1857, at the relation of the mother, who claimed the custody as guardian for nurture.\nIt appeared that the child was intelligent beyond her yeai\u2019s, and expressed great repugnance to leaving her present school, assigning as her reason, that \u201c as much as she loved her mother, she would not go to a school where she should be taught the idolatrous worship of the virgin and saints.\u201d\nIt appeared, also, that the father had been a Protestant, and that the mother was a Catholic, and desired to take away the child, for the avowed purpose of having her educated as a Catholic.\nAfter much consideration, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench decided that the mother, as guardian for nurture, had a legal right to the custody of her daughter, without regard to the election of the ward, and therefore decreed the custody to the mother; the court also holding that in such matters it knows of no distinction between different religious sects, and will not interfere with the discretion of guardians as to the faith in which they educate their wards.\nBy our law, when there is an occasion to appoint a guardian for a minor, he may, if above the age of fourteen years, elect a suitable person for that purpose (Comp. Stat. 384, sec. 2), thus assuming that until that age the infant has not sufficient discretion to exercise even this qualified right of election.\nIn Queen v. Clark the court held, that the infant, thus upwards of ten and a half years old, should not be admitted to examination on the subject of its wishes, assuming that so long as the guardianship for nurture continued, the right of custody was ordinarily perfect in the guardian, and could not be controlled by the wishes of the child. A similar distinction seems to be recognized by Chancellor Kent, in 2 Commentaries 194. It may be proper to say, that it does not follow that the wishes of the child, after it reaches the age of fourteen years, will control the discretion of the court in these cases. It is sufficient to say, that they will be consulted and weighed, with other circumstances, as in Rex v. Delaval, where the child was much more than that age.\nIn this case, there being no evidence that the father is unfit for the trust imposed upon him, there is no solid or substantial ground for refusing to award to him the custody of his child, unless we give to its wishes an influence which is not based upon either authority or reason, and might seriously and extensively interfere with that parental control which is wisely committed to the natural guardian of children.\nIt is also contended by the counsel, for the respondent that the father, by permitting his child to remain so long with its uncle, has waived and abandoned his parental-rights, and cannot now recall them \u2014 at least in this form of proceeding. And it does appear that during the last sickness of the child\u2019s mother, which lasted several years, the child was taken to the respondent\u2019s house, at the age of about five and a half months, and there kept at the respondent\u2019s expense until August, 1859, when the child visited her father at his house, and was taken sick, and on her recovery he declined to have her go back, and she remained with him until November 5, of the same year, when the respondent went to the father\u2019s house, in the absence of himself and his present wife, and took the child, with her free consent, and carried her to his house, where she has ever since remained; and the application for this writ was made February 27, 1860. From the return it appears that the respondent and his mother and sister understood it to be the wish of the mother in her last days that the child should remain and be brought up by them. On the other hand, it appeared that in January, 1854, about eight months after the death of his first wife, the father, having just married a lady suggested by the child\u2019s mother shortly before her death, and being desirous of bringing together his family, consisting of four children, including the one in question, went to Hanover for the purpose of taking home this, .child, but finding its grandmother and aunt extremely unwilling to part with it, and much excited upon the subject, he was induced to return without the child. He testifies, however, that he informed the respondent that he must not consider the child to be his, and this is not denied by the respondent, who testified on the occasion.\nIn the fall of 1856 there was further correspondence between the father and the respondent upon the subject, and occasionally, from that time until August, 1859; the father stating his desire to have his daughter return to him, and the respondent objecting that it would be hard to part with her, and urging that she should be allowed to remain for the present, until, in the providence of God, as he at one time expressed it, it should be best for her to go home. At another time, in October, 1857, the respondent writes the father that it seems to be settled that he intends to keep Martha, and that in case he took her away they should demand full compensation for keeping her.\nUpon the proofs exhibited it does not appear that any agreement was ever made by the father to yield the custody of the child to the respondent, or that he has, in any way, waived or abandoned his parental rights or duties. That he may transfer his parental rights to. another by indentures of apprenticeship, is unquestionable ; but it is not so clear that he can do so by verbal agreement; and there are several adjudged cases which decide that he cannot. Among these are Mayne v. Baldwin, 1 Halst. Ch. 454; People v. Mercein, 3 Hill 399; State v. Clover, 1 Harr. (N. J.) 419; People v. Mercein, 8 Paige Ch. 67; Rex v. Isley, 5 A. & E. 441; State v. Scott, 30 N. H. 276; Ex parte Earl of Westmeath, 1 Jacob 251. Upon this point, however, we give no opinion, as it is not necessary in the decision of this case.\nIt has been objected, that nothing more can be done in this form of proceeding than to set the child at liberty, and allow it to go where it pleases ; but, for the reasons already assigned, we think this objection cannot be sustained. In truth, this process, from its summary character, is eminently appropriate, in many instances furnishing the only efficient and adequate remedy, and thereby preventing that resort to violence which is likely to spring from the necessity of awaiting a more tedious proceeding. There are, doubtless, some decisions which give countenance to the idea that,. in a case like the present, the wishes of the child should govern the action of the court; but a close examination of those decisions, with other authorities upon the subject, establishes in our minds the correctness of the conclusions we have stated. In the English courts the doctrine is well settled, as appears by the case of Queen v. Clark, 7 El. & Black. 186, and the cases cited. A similar doctrine is maintained in Rex v. Grimhill, 4 A. & E. 624; and in Rex v. Isley, 5 A. & E. 441, where two children, six and nine years of age, on the death of their mother had been placed in the care and custody of their maternal grand-parents, who had returned from America for that purpose, at the request of the father, and in accordance with the wishes of the mother before her death. The children had been well taken care of by them for about five years, when the father died, and, on application of the testamentary guardian in a form like the present, the custody of the children was awarded to him. The same doctrine is held in People v. Mercein, 3 Hill (N. Y.) 399, which was very much considered, and the authorities carefully reviewed. In that case the husband and wife were living apart, under an agreement for a separation, and in it there was an agreement that she should he entitled to the custody of the child, notwithstanding which, after several decisions adverse to the father\u2019s claim, upon the ground that the tender age of the child needed the care of the mother, the custody of the child was at length, on habeas corpus, awarded to the father. The child was then about five years old, and no objection was made to the fitness of the mother, but it was held that the father had a legal and paramount right to the custody of the child, which could be enforced, and was not affected by an agreement to alienate to the wife the care and custody of the child; upon the ground that such an agreement was void.\nThe same general doctrines were recognized on a former application in the same case, reported in 8 Paige Ch. 47, where it was held that the jurisdiction of a court of equity embraces a writ of habeas corpus, and that the court will also act upon petitions without a bill. So in 2 Story Eq., sec. 1340, and note 1. The same views are recognized in People v. Mercein, 25 Wend. 64; People v. Chegaray, 18 Wend. 637, and People ex. rel. Nickerson, 19 Wend. 637. See, also, 2 Kent Com. 194. To the same effect are Mayer v. Baldwin, 1 Halst. (N. J.) 454; Armstrong v. Stone and Wife, 9 Gratt. 102. The case of Commonwealth v. Briggs, 16 Pick. 203, was a strong one; and, although the child was young (between three and four years only), and in the custody of the mother, yet, on habeas corpus, it was delivered up to the father. In the case of State v. Scott, 30 N. H. 274, the court, Woods, J., held that neither party had a legal right to the custody of the child; the agreement of the mother to commit the child to the care of the Society of Shakers having no binding force, and the right of the mother being lost by the second marriage: therefore it is held that the court have nothing to do but to inquire if the child is restrained of its liberty, and, if so, to set him free. This case, therefore, in no sense conflicts with the views we have expressed, but, on the contrary, assumes that the court may determine who has the legal right of custody, and leaves it open to. a fair inference that a decree might be according to the right.\nIn coming to the conclusion which we have reached, we cannot contemplate without pain the suffering that may he caused hy the breaking of those ties between the respondent\u2019s family and the child, which have been the growth of many years of affectionate care; and, in view of the extreme delicacy of the father\u2019s future position, we are unable to withhold one word of caution, and that is, that he may remember the former kindness of the respondent and his family, rather than the present opposition to his wishes ; but, more especially, that, in seeking to develop the virtues, and to promote the happiness of his restored child, he rely more upon the power of parental love than of parental authority.\nThe custody of the child, therefore, must be awarded to the father."},{"case_name":"John Horspool, Plaintiff and Respondent, v.

In that pro- \" ceeding the Court of Chancery had no jurisdiction of their persons ; no one was appointed or assumed to represent them, in it.\nThe mortgages were not made, nor was power to make them asked, for the purpose of so improving the estate that it would produce a fund, for their support.\nThe observations of the Chancellor, in Cochran v. Van Surlay, (20 Wend., 373-376,) furnish no warrant for holding the mortgages valid as against the infants.\nThe proceedings in the Court of Chancery were not taken under article 7, of title 2, of chapter 1, part 3, 2 Revised Statutes.\nIn Hedges v. Riker, (5 J. C. R., 163,) the proceeding was by bill, and the infants were parties to the suit. The Court, therefore, had jurisdiction of the persons of all the parties sought to be affected by the decree, as well as of the subject-matter of the suit.\nIn Pitcher v. Carter, (4 Sand. Ch.

In that the infants were parties to the proceeding to obtain authority to mortgage; and that authority was sought, avowedly, to provide for the support and education of the infants, as well as for the benefit of Mrs. Artois, and the order made attempted to provide for the payment, (in part at least,) of the mortgage, out of the income of the improvements to be made with the money, the mortgage was given to secure.\nIn the present case, these facts do not exist\u2014\nWhat the Court said of its power over the equitable estate of infants in Hedges v.

Carter, (supra,) was in point, and was an authority sustaining the validity of the mortgages in question.\nBut I think the distinctions already stated between that case and the present must have been overlooked; and that if these mort gages are to be upheld as valid and obligatory against the infants, then it must be conceded that the rule that a judgment, decree, or order, cannot affect strangers to it, has no application to infants ; and that infants who most need protection are not entitled to it, or to be heard upon the question whether their equitable interests shall be mortgaged or alienated, as an essential prerequisite to a valid mortgage or conveyance of them.\nIn my opinion the order giving authority to mortgage, and the mortgages in question executed in pursuance of it, are inoperative and void as against the children of Isabella M.

The object of their bill is to set. aside the devises and bequests in the will of-Charles McMicken to the.city of Cincinnati, in trust for the foundation and-maintenance of two colleges. \u2019 '\n. The testator says: \u201cHaving long cherished the desire to found an institution where white boys and girls may be taught, not only a knowledge of their duty to their Creator and their fellow men, but also receive the benefit of a sound, thorough, and practical English education,- and'such as might fit them for the active duties of life, as well as instruction in all the higher branches of knowledge, except denominational theology, to the extent that the same are now or may be hereafter taught in any of the secular colleges or universities of the highest grade in the country, I feel grateful to God that through His kind providence I have been sufficiently favored to gratify the wish of my heart. I therefore give, devise,'and bequeath to the city of Cincinnati, and its successors, for the purpose of building, establishing, and maintaining, as. far as practicable, after my decease, two colleges'for the education of boys and girls, all the following real and personal estate, in trust forever, to wit:\u201d describing the property in nine clauses of the thirty-first article'of the will.\nHe then proceeds to declare that none of the real estate devised, whether improved \u2018or otherwise, or which the city may purchase for the benefit of the colleges, should at any time'be sold, but, that the buildings upon any part of it should be kept in repair ouf of the revenues of his estate. In the event, however, of dilapidation, fife, or other cause, or if it shall be deemed expedient to have a larger income, he directs houses to. be taken down, and that they are to be rebuilt out of the income of his estate. He further authorizes purchases to' be made of other property, buildings to be put up on his vacant lots, and designates apart of the eastern boundary, of the grounds devoted to the college for the boys for the erection of boarding houses for the accommodation of the students, from which a l\u2019evenue may be derived.' The testator then declares where the colleges shall be-located, that there might be a separation between that for. the boys and that for the girls.There are other particulars under this article of the will which we need not recite, as they have no bearing upon the controversy made' by the bill. Passing over the 33d article of the vwill for the same\" reason, the next article in the will is a direction that.the Holy Bible of the .Protestant version, as contained in the Old and New Testaments, shall be used as a book of instruction in the colleges. Next, it is declared that in all applications for admission to the colleges, that preference should be given \u201cto any and all of the testator\u2019s relations aud descendants, to all and any of his legatees and their descendants, and to Max McMicken aud his descendants.\u201d' Then he directs: \u201c If, after the organization and establishment of the institution,\u201d and the admission of as many'pupils as in the discretion of the city have been received, there shall remain a sufficient surplus of funds, that the same shall be applied to making additional buildings, and to the.support'of poor white male and female orphans, neither of whose parents are. living, &e., &e., preference to be given to. my relations and collateral descendants, &c., &c.; that they w\u2019ere to receive a sound English education,, &C., &e.; and afterwards, directions are given as to the mode of receiving such poor white male and female orphans, and the .privileges to be allowed under certain circumstances. The testator, in the thirty-fourth article of his will,- declares that \u201cthe establishment of the regulations necessary to carry out the objects of'.my endowment Ileave to the. wisdom\u2019and discretion of the-corporate authorities'of the city of Cincinnati, who shall have power to appoint directors to said institution.\u201d The last article of the will relates to the devises and bequests to the city, and directions as to paying-the accounts of .the trust. The testator then nominates executors, and they are the appellees in this appeal.\nThis statement has been made, that the devises arid bequests of the testator may be fully disclosed, and the merit of them as \u00e1 charitable use may be fully understood.\n' \u2022 Our first observation is, that it was his intention to establish primarily, two colleges for boys and girls, and then a third for the support of poor white male and female orphans, neither of whose parents were living, and who were without-any means of support, who were to receive a sound English education. .This\"third school was to be founded by applying to the-purpose the surplus funds which might remain after the complete organization of the colleges. (36th article of the will.) The testator anticipated that there would be such a Surplus, as he left it in the discretion of the city to determine the number of the pupils who were to be admitted to the colleges. We must then'keep in mind the thirty-first and thirty-sixth articles of the will in considering it, though they are but contingently connected by the. happening of a surplus in the way just mentioned.- For, now, if the first is subject to a failure, as a gift for charitable purposes, the devises and bequests .may be good under the second.. . Our attention, however, will be chiefly \u00bfiven to the thirty-first section and its clauses, as under that it was principally argued by counsel.\nThe learned sergeant, Sir Francis Moore,- who drew the statute of 43 Elizabeth, chapter 4, says, in his exposition.of it: \u201cAs in all other grants, so in a gift to a charitable use, four things are principally to be considered: 1. The ability of the donor. 2. The capacity of the donee.. 3.' The instrument or means whereby it is given. 4. The thing itself which is or may be given to a charitable use.\u201d And then, by way of caution to donors, he says: \u201cThere are five things which cannot be granted to such a use: 1. Things that yield'no profit. 2. Things that are incident to others, and \u2018inseparable. 3. Possibilities of interest. 4. Conditions \u2014 meaning that such things are from their nature insusceptible of serving such a purpose;\u201d and then he adds the 5th: \u201cCopyholds, if in any way prejudicial to the lord.\u201d \u00a5e shall not consider them numerically,' but both seem to be the natural way to discuss such a gift, when its validity is disputed. \u00a5e shall follow it >u those particulars as briefly as we can.\nNo question is made, however, in this case, as to the execution of the will, nor as to the capacity of the devisor. It is insisted, though,'that the devises and bequests to the donee, the city of Cincinnati, are void, because the city has not the capacity to take them, and also that they create a perpetuity from being inalienable, which is contrary to law.\nCharity, in a legal sense, is rather a matter of description than of definition; and the word perpetuity in law is only determined by the circumstances of such cases. But for the purposes of'this case, the objection to the validity of the charity on account of its perpetuity, we will place under Mr. Sander\u2019s'definition in his Essay upon Uses and Trusts, 196: \u201cA pei\u2019petuity may be defined to be a future limitation, restraining the owner of the estate from aliening the fee of the.property, discharged of such future use or estate, before the event is determined or the period is arrived when such future use or estate is to arise. \u25a0 If that event or period be within the bounds prescribed by law, it is not a perpetuity.\u201d It is then a limitation' upon the jus disponendi of property, upon the common-law right of every man to dispose of his'land \u201cto any other private man at his own discretion.\u201d And one class of those limitations is technically termed alienation in mortmain, and to charitable uses. \"Alienation in mortmain, in its primary signification, is an alienation of lands or tenements to any corporation, aggregate, ecclesiastical, or temporal, the consequence of which in former times was, that by allowing lands to become vested in objects endued with perpetuity of duration, the lords were deprived of escheats and other feudal profits, and the general policy of the common law, which favored the \u00bffree circulation of prop- . erty, was frustrated, although it is true that at the common law the poioer of purchasing lands ivas incident to every corporation. The effect of these statutes deprived every corporation in England, spiritual or secular, from acquiring, either by purchase or gift, real property of any description, without a general license from the Crown enabling it to hol'd lands in mortmain, or a special license in reference to any particular acquisition. These restraints were subsequently relaxed in many particulars, including gifts to a corporation for purposes of education. But this case does not require'us to particularize them; our or7yp\u00fcrpose for having alluded to statutes of mortmain being to show, from the view taken of them from.an early day by the courts in England, that devises to corporations, which generally cannot take lands under a will, were held good when made in favor of charities, and that such gifts, from the.-purposes to which they were to be applied, and the ownership to which \u25a0they' are subjected, have had the protection of courts of equity to prevent any alienation of them on the. part of the person or body interested with the offices of giving them effect; and that in all such eases land has been decreed by courts:of equity to be practically inalienable, or that a perpetuity of them exists in corporations when they are charitable gifts.. Hillam\u2019s case, Duke, 80, 375; Mayor of Bristol v. Whitton, 1633, Duke, 81, 377; Mayor of Reading v. Lane, 1601, Duke, 81, 361; Lewis on Perpetuity, 684; 1 Macnaghten and S. Gordon, 460; Chart. Hospital v. Granger; Griffin v. Graham, 1 Hawks, 130; State v. Girard, 2 Ired. Eq. R., 210. The objection that the devises and bequests create a perpetuity cannot be maintained unless they are forbidden by the law of Ohio. And if a perpetuity was forbidden, the charitable trust would not fail, but vs ould be held good and carried out in equity.\nWe were told that the first and second sections of the 13th article of the Constitution, in connection with the legislation of the State under them, prevent an estate in perpetuity from being made in Ohio. And for showing the bearing of them upon this case, we were referred to an act of Ohio to restrain the entailment of real estates. 2 Swan, sees. 355 \u2014 6.\nWe are unable to.see any fair connection between them. The first and second sections of the 13th'article of the Constitution were, that, the General Assembly shall pass no special act conferring corporate powers. Sec. 2. Corporations may be formed under general laws, but all such may from time to time be-dliered or repealed \u2014 rthat is, though they may be formed under general laws, that the Legislature may alter or repeal them. That by the provision they meant to retain their legislative powers to give larger powers than a corporation might have had, to reform them in any particular that might become necessary, that of the violation of a contract excepted. The act to restrict the entailment of real estates obviously applies to individuals exclusively, and not at all to corporations, and-especially to such of them as may. take and hold charitable gifts in perpetuity.\nThe first act passed under the Constitution of 1851, relating to corporation's, was to enable the trustees of colleges, academies, universities, and other institutions for promoting education, to become bodies corporate. We will give it in its term's, for nothing in the legislation of that State can show more satisfactorily than it does thatpublie spirit there is in harmony with, and fully up to, that of the age upon the subject of education. The language of the 1st section is, that any number of persons, not less than five, desiring to establish a college, university, or other institution for the purpose of. promoting education, leligion or morality, agriculture and the fine arts, may, by complying with the provisions Of the act, become a body corporate and politic, with perpetual succession, and may assume a-corporate name, by which they may sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, in all courts of law and equity; may heve a coiporate seal,* and the same alter or break at pleasure; may hold all kinds of estate, real, personal, and mixed, which they may acquire by purchase, donation, devise, or otherwise, necessary to accomplish the objects of the corporation; and further, the trustees of any university, college, or academy may hold in trust any property devised, or bequeathed, \u201c or 'donated\u201d .to such institution, upon any-specific trust consistent with the objects of said corporation; .also, whemany number of persons shall have procured by subscription, donation, or devise, purchase, or otherwise, the sum of five hundred dollars, for the purpose of establishing an academy, they may become a bodj7 corporate, &c.,. &c., and do all acts and things necessary for the promotion of education and the.general interests of such academy. Time and the occasion will not permit us to give more of this liberal and enlightened statute, and of the supplemental acts passed in August, 1852, and March, 1853. ' 2 Swan, secs. 195, 196.\nThere is nothing in either of them in any way interfering with the power of before existing corporations, to become the trustees of charitable devises and bequests for education, and to hold them in perpetuity. There is rather a disposition manifested to enlarge and confirm -their power to do., so, and to give to other corporations under the act certainty and security in the administration of such trusts.- The Legislature has succeeded in giving to corporations, for the promotion of education, what the learned gentlemen who brought this bill said were the requisites of a corporation: lawful existence; artificial capacity and perpetuity of existence; and, we add, the unquestioned enjoyment of all these privileges, which courts of equity have said for more than two'hundred years they were entitled to, in the construction of devises and gifts for charity, and fot the administration of them.\nIt was conceded in the argument, that the trusts in this will fall within the description of public trusts or charitable uses, as recognised in England since the statute of 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, notwithstanding that statute is not in force in Ohio, and, in our opinion, never was, as we shall show presently,\nCharities had their origin in the great command, to love thy neighbor as thyself. But when the Emperor Constantine . permitted his subjects to bequeath their property to the church, it was soon abused; so much so, that afterwards, when it became too common to give land to religious uses, consistently with the-free circulation of property, the supreme, authority of every nation in Europe, where Christianity prevailed, found it necessary.to limit such devises by statutes of mortmain.-\nIn France*, by the ancient constitutions of that kingdom, churches, communities, chapters, colleges, convents, &c., were not permitted to acquire or-hold immoveable property.' Dumoulin sur 1st art., 51 De la' Cou., Paris. This incapacity after a ,lf?ng time was relaxed, and they were allowed to hold; by license of the King.\nIn,Spain, th\u00e9 communities mentioned before could neither acquire nor hold property, unless by authority of the Sovereign; but in England, corporations had the capacity to take property by the common law. Co. Litt., 99. They were rendered incapable of purchasing without the King\u2019s license by a succession of statutes from Magna Charta, 9 Henry 3, to 9 Geo. 2.\nThey are known as the statutes of mortmain; that is, as it was the privilege of any one, before such statute restrained it, to leave his property of every kind by testament to whom he pleased, and for such purposes, charitable or otherwise, as he chose; and the will was, in every particular, administered according to the testator\u2019s intentions, sometimes by the. courts of common law, and at othersdy a court in chancery, as may be seen from the cases in Duke and.other.writers upon charities. The question, then, under such a condition of the law in Ohio, where there was no- statute of mortmain, cannot' be in this\" case, whether, chancery had. such a jurisdiction, or whether Ohio had adopted in whole or in part the common law, but whether Ohio, in the construction of her judicial system, did \u25a0not mean to give to those'courts which were to have equity jurisdiction cognizance of trusts made by wills for charitable' uses, as well as of other trusts; and whether the judges in Ohio have not uniformly entertained it upon that principle. We cannot be mistaken in the conclusion that they have done so from the eases cited on both sides in the argument of this ease, the larger number of which we have verified by examination.\nAnd we are more confirmed in what has just been said, for the English statutes of mortmain were never in England sup posed to have been meant to extend to her colonies, and were never in force in those of them in America which became independent States, but by legislative adoption.\nFirst, it will be observed in all commentaries upon those statutes they are termed local or political- laws, meant to suppress a public mischief and abuse in England. The statute of 43 Elizabeth is entitled, \u201cAn act to redress the misemployment of lands, goods, and stocks of money, heretofore given to charitable uses.\u201d The mode and manner for the enforcement of it in any particular did not exist in any one of the English colonies. There was not in either of them a Lord Keeper or Lord Chancellor, or any corresponding officer to mature the regulations enjoined by the act. for its .enforcement. There were not in the colonies any abuses .to l\u2019edress for the misemployment of lands, goods, or money heretofore given to charitable uses; further, there were not then in any one of them those religious institutions which' the monarchs of Europe deemed it politic to restrain from holding lands.\nThe statute, after beginning with a statement of the abuses to be controlled, declares that for the redress of .them it shall be the duty of the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper of the great seal for the time being, and for the Chancellor of the Dutchy of Lancaster for the time being, to award commissions, &c., into all or any part of the realm, for the purpose of executing the, &c., statute, and the realm or Idngdom of England, in statutory parlance, as well in the,time of Elizabeth as, now, \u201cmeant the kingdom over which her municipal laws or the common law had jurisdiction, and did not. include either \"Wales, Scotland, or Ireland, or any other part of the King\u2019s dominions, except the territory of England only.\u201d 1 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, sec. 4, p. 93, Wendell.\n' And in the same section, after having enumerated those dominions which had been subjected by statute or otherwise to the laws-of England, and such as had not been, all being adjacent to England, Blackstone says, our more distant plantations in America or elsewhere are also in some respects subjeet to English law. But that must be understood with very many and very great restrictions. Such - colonies carry with them only so much -of the English law as is applicable to their own situation and the condition of an infant colony; sudh, for instance, as the general rules of inheritance and of protection from personal injuries. Pp.107, 108 Marginal. But we are not left to inferences to establish tlie locality of the- operation of the statutes of mortmain to England, and that they never had any force in the colonies.- The whole subject in all its generality was ably discussed and decided in the high court of chancery, in England some forty years since. In that case, 2 Merivale, 143, the Attorney General v. Stewart, the question being whether the statute of mortmain, 9 Geo. II, extended to the island of Grenada, in the West Indies, it was ruled that it did not, and that none of the English mortmain acts were of force in the colonies.\nWithout, then, a particular enactment for such purpose, the statute of 43 Elizabeth, c. 4,-could never have been in force in Ohio. Nor do we think it to be a point of judicial uncertainty there, for we cannot find a decision in the courts of Ohio directly declaring that it ever was.\n. The law was adopted i-n terms from the statute of Virginia by the Governor and judges of the Territory. 1 Chase, 190. Whatever may-have been its validity in other respects, it did not comprehend the statute of Elizabeth. For though, it was a remedial statute to correct abuses, it was a restraining statute of the common-law right of every man to dispose of his property by will as he pleased. The law taken from Virginia for Ohio made statutes and acts of Parliament in aid- of the common law, which were of a.general nature, and not local to that kingdom, of force in Ohio. It was not in aid of the common law, but being restrictive of it, it should have, as to the places assigned for its operation, a strict interpretation.\nBut-whether we are right or not so, in respect to the law adopted from Virginia, and passed in the Territorial Legisla ture of Ohio, it is certain that in the year 1806 it was repealed; and that since the statute of Elizabeth has had no force in Ohio as a statute, though th\u00e9 judges of that State, without any assumption, have applied its principles to all cases of charitable devises as a part of chancery jurisdiction:- It certainly'was right in' them and a duty to carry out the charitable intentions of a testator by the same principles that his will was executed iu every other respect, when the Legislature was' silent in respect to such devises, or had given no other rule concerning them.\nNo more was done by them in Ohio than was done in every ' other State in this Union where the statute of Elizabeth had not been adopted by legislative enactment;\nBut injustice to the subject we cannot leave it without saying that original chancery jurisdiction over charities existed in England, and was exercised there, before the statute of Elizabeth was passed; also, that it has now become an established principle of American law,, that courts of chancery will sustain and protect such a gift, devise, \u25a0 or bequest, or dedication of property to public charitable1 uses, provided the same is consistent with local laws and public policy, where the object- of the gift is a dedication specific and capable of being carried into effect according to the intentions of the donor. In confirmation of this we refer to the eases collected in Angel\u00ed-and Ames upon Corporations, private and aggregate, 6th edition, 182, 177, and from pages 170 to 180, inclusive.'\nAnd this court, in Vidal et al. v. Mayor of Philadelphia et al., reviewed its opinion to the contrary of what lias just been said in the case of the Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s executors, and admitted, whatever doubts had been expressed in that opinion, that they had been removed by later and more satisfactory sources of information.\nAnd iii Vidal\u2019s case the court went on to say: If may, therefore, be considered as settled, that chancery has an original and necessary jurisdiction in respect to devises and bequests in trust to persons competent to take for charitable purposes, when the general object is specific and certain, and not contrary to any positive rule of law. 2 Kent\u2019s Comm., 287, 288, 4 edition; Gibson v.

J., avoiding the discussion of the extent of chancery jurisdiction over charities independently of the statute, .says: But one of the earliest claims of every social community upon its law-givers is an adequate protection to its property and institutions, which subserve; public uses, or are devoted to its elevation, &c.; and, in a proper case, the courts of one State might be driven into-the recognition of some principle analogous to that contained in the statute of Elizabeth as a necessary element of our jurisprudence. But without .reference to these considerations, where a trust is clearly defined, and a-'trustee exists capable of holding the property and executing \u00edlie trust, it has never, been doubted that chancery has jurisdiction over it-by its own inherent authority, not. derived from the statute, nor resulting from its' functions as parens patriae. The. same ruling was made afterwaids in 15 Ohio R., 593, and in 18 Ohio R., 500, and the main point in both of . them could not have been decided without maintaining the. jurisdiction-in chancery over charitable uses, independently of. the statute of Elizabeth. The same may be-assumed- of the' cas\u00e9 growing out of the will in 20 Ohio R., 483. Indeed, it was assumed that no ease in Ohio of a ehari-' table trust has been judicially maintained, or co.uld have been valid under the univers.al admission that the statute of the 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, was ..not in force in Ohio, unless\" the courts there had acted from the conviction that in such cases chan-' eery had a jurisdiction over them by its own authority.\nWe shall now consider the objections which were made by the counsel for the appellants to the validity of the devises and bequests of Mr. McMicke'u, that the city of Cincinnati has not the. capacity to take them and to execute the trusts of the will, and that no other trustee can be appointed. \u2022\nIn Purview, the answers to them from the opposing counsel were decisive. No incapacity of the city of Cincinnati to fake in this instance can be inferred from its charter. - It. hasj'the. power to acquire, to hold, and possess, real-and personal property ,&e., &c., and to exercise such other powers and to have such other privileges as are incident to municipal corporations \u2022 of a like character and degree, not inconsistent with this act' or the general laws of the State,. Swan, 960. It was admitted .in the argument, that the section just read confers power upon the city to acquire and hold real estate for the legitimate objects of the city. These objects are enumerated in many particulars directly connected with its powers to govern the city, and in the nineteen sections following that cited there is-not a sentence or word from whiclian inference can be made \u2022 that the Legislature meant to deprive the city of Cincinnati. from taking and administering charitable trusts. Indeed,1. such a course would have been inconsistent .with the Legisla-,ture\u2019s caution in its enactments under the Constitution of 1851. It would be doing great injustice to the Legislature-even to suppose that -it meant, in passing an act for the' government of corporations, under the provisions of the Constitution, that it designed to encroach upon that of the judiciary, or to alter the whole power of chancery in respect to charitable uses, and the.long-established practice of corporations, private and municipal, to receive them as trustees, and to \u25a0 administer . them according to the intention of donors. So far from any intention to interfere with such a privilege in the city of Cincinnati, we infer from previous and subsequent legislation \u2022 that it was to have an important agency in carrying out the 6th article of the Constitution in respect to education.. \"We allude to'the act for the-better organization and classification of the common schools in Cincinnati and Dayton, passed in the year 1846, (Ohio Local Laws, 91,) and to that of the 27th January, 1853, both now in force. - In the first, the trustees and visiters of common'schools in the city, of Cincinnati, with the consent of the city council, have the power to establish and maintain out of any funds under the control of the trustees and visiters such \u2019other grades of schools than those already established as they may deem expedient for such purpose. Further, by the 68th section of the State School Law, Swan, 852, passed in January, 1856, power is given to township boards of education, and their successors in office, to take and hold in trust for the use of central or high schools, or sub-district schools, in the township, any grant or donation, or bequests of money, or other personal property, to be applied to the support of such public schools. Again, in Ohio Laws, 38, March 26,1856, it is declared that whenever any one gives lands or money for the endowment of a school or academy, not previously established, and shall not provide for the management of it, that the Court of Common Pleas shall appoint trustees with corporate powers. That act\u2019provides also for the management of charities when the founders have not given directions; and another act, Swan, 193, 1856, provides how colleges may be incorporated by their own act, and how trustees of an endowment may also become a corporation by their own abt. These acts have been cited to show that Ohio, in her legislation, has made' municipal corporations trustees for charity devises and bequests, and that the management of them is a'duty. 'They also prove that the privilege to take them is one given aud imposed by law.\nAfter a close examination of all the legislation of Ohio relating to corporations, and its system of education, we have not been able to detect auy sentence or word going to show any intent to alter the law as it stood before the adoption of the Constitution of 1851, in respect to a corporation receiving and taking,' either by testament or donation, property for a charity, or to prevent them from having trustees for the execution of it \u25a0according to the-intention of the donor. To take such privileges from them can only ba done by statute expressly, and not by any, implication by statutes, or. from any number o'f \u2022 sections in statutes analogous to the subject, containing directions for the management of corporations. The lav? is, that where the .corporation has a legal \u2022 capacity to take real . or personal, estate, then it may take and hold it upon .trust . in the same manner and to the same extent as private persons may do. It is true that if the trust be repugnant or inconsistent with the proper purposes for which it was created, that may iurnish a good reason why it may not be compelled to execute it. In such \u00e1 case, the trust itself being good, will be executed under the authority of a court of equity. Neither is there any positive objection, in point of law, to a corporation taking property upon trust no.t strictly within the scope of the direct purposes of its institutions, but collateral to them, as for the benefit of a stranger or another corporation. But. .if the purposes of the trust be germain to the objects of'the corporation, if they relate to matters which will promote and perfect these objects, if they tend to the suppression of .vice and immorality, to the advancement of the public health and order, and to the promotion of trade, industry, and happiness,'' where is the law to be found which prohibits the corporation from taking the devise upon such trust in a State where the statutes of mortmain do not exist., the corporation- itself having an estate as well by devise as otherwise? Wo know of no authority which inculcates such a doctrine, or prohibits the execution of such trusts, even though the act of incorporation may have for its main objects mere civil and municipal government and powers. 2 How., 190. This court announced the-same principle again in the case of McDonough v. Murdoch, 15 How., 367, with other and new illustrations, and with direct reference to the capacity of a corporation to take such trusts,if within its general objects, or such as were collateral or incidental to its main purpose. There is nothing in the Ohio statute of wills to prevent corporations from taking by devise. Mueh was also said in the argument denying the legality of the trusts, in consequence of the uncertainty of the benefici-' aries, and because the relatives of the testator were to have the preference. As to the first, white boys and girls make as distinctive a status of a class who are to be the first beneficiaries of the trust, and the words in the 36th section, that \u201cif any surplus shall remain, &c.,.it shall be apjlied to the support of poor white male and female orphans, neither of whose parents are living, and who are without any means of support,\u201d make as certain a description as could .have been expressed.\nIt seems -to us, now, that the objection relative to the condition of the beneficiaries is at variance with the established primary rule in respect to a charity, not only with reference' to the statute of 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, but to a charity under the common law. The answer is, that a charity is a gift to a general public use, which extends to tne rich, as well as to the poor. Jones v. Williams, Amb., c. 651. Generally, devises and bequests having for their object establishments of learning are considered as given to charitable uses, under the statpte of Elizabeth, Attorney General v. Earl of Lat\u00edsdale; but that does not make a' devise good to a college for purposes hot of a collegiate character, intended chiefly to gratify the vanity of the.testator. And we cannot be mistaken, that a devise to a corporation in trust for any person is good, and will be effectuated in equity. 1 Bro. Ch. Cas., 81. And fortiori, a devise to a charitable corporation, in trust for any other charitable use, would be good. All property held for public purposes is held as a charitable use, in the legal sense of the term charity. Law Library, vol. 80, p. 116, Grant on Corporations.\nWe will not pursue the subject further; for, without having discussed either of the six objections made in the bill of the complainants, or the points made by counsel in support of the demurrer to the bill, numerically, both have been under our examination; for all were appropriately in the argument of the cause, and in this opinion we meant to decide all of them, and have done so.\nWe cannot announce them more expressively than they were urged in argument:\n1. The doctrines founded upon the statute of 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, in relation to cbarit\u00e1ble trusts to corporations, either municipal or private,-have been adopted by the courts of equity in Ohio, but not by express legislation; nor was that necessary to give courts of equity in Ohio that jurisdiction.\n2. The English'statutes of mortmain were never in force in the En'glish colonies; and if they were ever considered to be so in the State of Ohio, it must have been from that resolution by the Governor and judges in her territorial condition; and if so, they were repealed by the act of 1806.\n8. The city of Cincinnati as a corporation is capable of taking in trust devises and bequests for charitable uses, and can take and administer tire devises and bequests in the will of C. McMieken.\n\u2022 4. Those devises and bequests are charities, in a legal sense, . and are valid in equity, and may be enforced in equity by its jurisdiction in such matters without the intervention of legislation by the State of Ohio.\n5. McMieken\u2019s direction, in section 32 of his will, that the. real estate devised should not be alienated, makes no- perpetuity in the sense -forbidden by the law, but only a perpetuity allowed by law and equity in the cases of charitable trusts.-\n6. There is no uncertain^ in the devises and bequests as' tp\" the beneficiaries of his intention; and his, preference of particular persons, as to who should be pupils in the colleges which he meant to' found, was a lawful exercise of his rightful power to make the devises and bequests.\n7. The disposition which he makes of any surplus after the complete organization of the colleges is a good charitable use for poor white male and female orphans.\n8. Legislation, of Ohio upon the subject of corporations, by the. act of April 9, 1852, does not stand in the way of carrying into effect the devises and bequests of the will.\nThis cause was argued on both sides with such learning and ability, that we feel it to be only right to the profession to acknowledge the assistance given to us in forming our con-\u2019 elusions; and our only regret is, that it should necessarily have extended this opinion to a greater length than we wished it to be.\nWe shall direct the affirmance of the decree dismissing the bill by the court below."},{"case_name":"In re McDONALD","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6585854\/","date":"1861-01-01","court":"United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri","content":"TBEAT, District Judge.\nSince the adjournment, as thorough an examination of authorities as practicable has been made, with the view of arriving at a correct conclusion upon the jurisdictional question presented. Every authority cited by the learned counsel, and their able arguments, have been carefully considered. The question, though one of pure law, involves an inquiry into the United States constitution and statutes, the organization of the United States courts, the power vested in United States judges, and the sources of American jurisprudence. In the hasty preparation of an opinion taking so wide a range, it is not to be expected that much labor has been bestowed upon logical order or method, or mere forms of expression. The important consideration is to reach a correct conclusion. The undivided attention of the court, therefore, has been fixed upon the single proposition submitted. With other points or issues, which may or may not be reached in the further prosecution of this cause, the court, at this time, has nothing to do.\nThe case stands, at present, on a demurrer to the return. The counsel for the respondent has suggested a question of jurisdiction; and, as that question always lies in limine, it is right and proper that it should be first considered. As a preliminary step, then, it must be determined whether the court has jurisdiction \u2014 whether it can proceed any further in the matter before it; for, most certainly, when asked to pass upon the authority of others, official or otherwise, it should be scrupulously careful not to exceed its own legal powers. The duty to decide what the law is, in each case before it, and to enforce its decisions for the maintenance of constitutional and legal authority in whomever vested, for the time being, is no less imperative than to protect the humblest rights of persons and property. Every officei of the government, and every private citizen, is alike entitled to the full measure of protection furnished by law, and is alike responsible to it for every violation of its mandates. In its administration, there is no inequality \u2014 all stand before it on the same level. Has a United States district judge, or a United States district court, jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus and hear the case, when the petitioner is held under illegal restraint without any formal or technical \u201ccommitment?\u201d Is it not essential to such jurisdiction that the petitioner should be in jail, or imprisoned by virtue of some judgment, warrant, order, rule, or process, judicial or otherwise \u2014 or, at least, be so held \u201cunder restraint?\u201d Or, on the other hand, is it sufficient that he is illegally restrained of his liberty \u201cunder or by color of the authority of the United States,\u201d irrespective of the fact whether there has been a technical \u201ccommitment\u201d or not? In short, is this case one of federal or exclusively state jurisdiction?\nThe petition, on which the writ was issued, avers substantially, that the petitioner is now, and has been since the 10th inst.. held in unlawful confinement within the United States arsenal in this city, a military post under the command of the respondent; that he is so held under no writ, process, judgment, decree, committal, or order of any state court, or state officer, or by virtue of any state law, proceeding, or power, civil or military; that, \u201con the contrary, his said illegal confinement is under or by color of the authority of the United States;\u201d and that said unlawful confinement is by no order, judgment, decree, or committal of any judicial tribunal of the United States, nor in virtue of any writ or process issuing therefrom. The petition then sets out the facts and circumstances connected with his caption, which are unimportant at this stage of the case, inasmuch as they do not qualify, in any manner, the direct averments above mentioned. Hence the jurisdictional question is free from all technicalities pertaining to careless use of language, for the averments are full and precise. It becomes a fundamental question, then, in the case, and must be directly and fairly met at the very threshold. ^Nothing has, in many cases, been more perplexing to American jurists than a correct definition of the exact limits, or the ascertainment of the true boundaries, between federal and state jurisdiction. In some classes of cases, federal jurisdiction is exclusive; in some, state jurisdiction; whilst in others the federal and state judiciary have concurrent authority. The dividing line is not always to be readily ascertained.\nThe whole power vested by the United States constitution in the federal judiciary has never yet been called into potential or full force and activity; nor have the necessary statutes been passed to give vital and practical energy to all of the grants of power concerning any of the three great departments of the government. The courts are, therefore, compelled to pass upon each case separately, as it arises, limiting their decisions to the particular facts before them. In the organization of the United States district courts, congress has defined the portion of judicial power with which they are entrusted. Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall. [4 U. S.] 8. Beyond that limit they cannot pass. 1 Kent. Comm. 294. It is not whether congress could not have vested in them larger powers; but simply what authority has actually been entrusted to them. Hence, in each instance, recurrence must be had to the United States statutes; and, if those statutes are within the grants of the constitution, the means are at hand for settling the controversy. No actual or apprehended conflict between the state and federal authority exists in this ease; yet the inquiry is just as appropriate concerning the extent of power really vested in this tribunal. Every public officer \u2014whether executive, ministerial, or legislative \u2014 has to decide for himself, in the first instance, the true extent of his authority, subject always, in free governments, to a lawful revision of his acts in every case which may involve their validity. So is it, most unquestionably, with judicial officers and courts. Hence acts of congress have been solemnly pronounced unconstitutional and void; executive mandates condemned as in contravention, or without authority of law; ministerial proceedings, supposed legal for a time, finally adjudged trespasses; and judicial decisions overruled and annulled by superior judicial tribunals. Yet there is no instability in all this; it is merely an assertion of the fundamental principle of free government, viz. the supremacy of law. A thorough knowledge of the law, applicable to each case, and implicitly followed, would render all conflict of legal authority almost an impossibility. It is only necessary, therefore, to avoid conflicts, for citizens, whether acting in their private or official capacity, to understand correctly their legal rights and duties \u2014 to comprehend fully that, in. a11, the varied and shifting exigencies of public and private affairs, law is still supreme \u2014 the source of all legitimate authority, the only power no one can disobey with impunity, to which all are subject, and which all have an equal right to invoke for the maintenance of their lives, liberties, and property. No one in this land is so exalted as to be above its restraining force, and none so humble as to be beneath its protecting care. Were it otherwise, lawlessness would dominate, anarchy follow, and liberty itself be impossible, for \u201cthere can be no liberty save in the harness of the law.\u201d \u201cWhen the law ceases to be the test of right and remedy \u2014 when individuals undertake to be its administrators by rules of their own adoption \u2014 the bonds of society are broken. The first duty of citizens in a government of laws is obedience to its ordinances.\u201d Johnson v. Tompkins TCase No. 5,410]. Foremost of all should be the tribunals of law, to keep strictly within legal limits. Whilst fearless in the exercise of lawful power, they should be scrupulously vigilant not to exceed the legal boundaries set to their action. They minister at a sacred altar, and with religious fidelity must they be true to their trust. They can yield nothing, and must assume nothing. Like the supreme court of the United States, they \u201cmust grasp at nothing \u2014 shrink from nothing.\u201d In this spirit the courts should always act, and in modern times have generally acted. Hence it is that jurisdictional questions occupy so large a portion of judicial inquiry; and well is it that such has been the fact, for the conclusions thus reached enable others to recur to the past for its calm solution of propositions, which excitements of a subsequent hour might distort or color with passion or prejudice.\nThe language of Judge Cranch (U. S. v. Bollman [Case No. 14,622]), is especially instructive, because, in the very case in which he gave utterance to such correct thoughts, he was overruled by his colleagues, but sustained, on review, by the United States supreme court: \u201cIn times like these, when the public mind is agitated \u2014 when wars and rumors of wars, plots, conspiracies and treasons excite alarm \u2014 it is the duty of a court to be peculiarly watchful, lest the public feeling should reach the seat of justice, and thereby precedents be established which may become the ready tools of faction in times more disastrous. The worst of precedents may be established from the best of motives.. We ought to be upon our guard, lest our zeal for the public interest lead us to overstep the bounds of the law and the constitution; for, although we may thereby bring one criminal to punishment. we may furnish the means by which a hundred innocent persons may suffer. The constitution was made for times of commotion. In the calm of peace and prosperity, there is seldom great injustice. Dangerous precedents occur in dangerous times. It then becomes the duty of the judiciary calmly to poise the scales of justice, unmoved by the arm of power, undistuibed by the clamor of the multitude. Whenever an application is made to us in our judicial character, we are bound, not only by the nature of our office, but by our solemn oaths, to administer justice according to the laws and constitution of the United States. No political motives, no reasons of state, can justify a disregard of that solemn injunction. In cases of emergency, it is for the executive department of the government to act upon its own responsibility, and to rely upon the necessity of the case for its justification; but this court is bound by the law and the constitution in all events. When, therefore, the constitution declares that \u2018the right of the people to be secure in their persons\u2019 \u2018against unreasonable seizures,\u2019 \u2018shall not be violated,\u2019 and that \u2018no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by. oath or affirmation,\u2019 this court is as much bound as any individual magistrate to obey its command.\u201d\nThese truths, though elementary, are too apt to be overlooked. No apology is necessary for recurring to them at this time.\nFirst. As to the right and duty of every court to decide upon the extent of its own jurisdiction, and the duty of every party upon whom process is served to appear in obedience thereto: \u201cEvery day and in every court, writs issue at the instance of parties asserting a grievance, and very often when, in truth, no grievance has been sustained. The party assailed comes before the court in obedience to its process. He perhaps questions the jurisdiction of the court. Perhaps he denies the fact charged. Perhaps he explains that the fact, as charged, was by reason of circumstances a lawful one. The judge is not presumed to know beforehand, all the merits of the thousand and one causes that come before him; he decides when he has heard. But the first duty of a defendant, in all cases, is obedience to the writ which calls him into court. Till he has rendered this, the judge cannot hear the cause, still less pass upon its merits.\u201d U. S. v. Williamson [Case No. 16,726]. Opinion of Judge Kane. \u201cThere are some proceedings in which the want of jurisdiction would be seen at the first blush, but there are others in which the court must inquire into all the facts, before it can possibly know whether it has jurisdiction or not. Any one who obstructs or baffles a judicial investigation for that purpose, is unquestionably guilty of a crime, for which he may and ought to.be tried, convicted and punished. Suppose a local action to be brought in the wrong county, this is a defence to the action, but a defence which must be made out like any other. While it is pending, neither a party, nor an officer, nor any other person, can safely insult the court, or resist its order. The court may not have power to decide upon the merits of the case, but it has undoubted power to try whether the wrong was done within its jurisdiction or not. Suppose Hr. Williamson to be called before the circuit court of the United States,.as a -witness, in a trial for murder alleged to be committed on the high seas, can he refuse to be sworn, and at his trial for contempt justify himself on the ground that the murder was in fact committed within the limits of a state, and therefore triable only in a state court? If he can, he can justify perjury for the same reason. But such a defence for either crime has never been heard of, since the beginning of the world. * * * The duty of the court to inquire into the facts on which its jurisdiction depends, is as plain as its duty not to exceed it when it is ascertained.\u201d 26 Pa. St. 21.\nSecond. As this court must determine its own jurisdiction, the next inquiry is as to the modeof ascertaining it. Here it is better that the views of this court should be expressed in the language of Chief Justice Marshall, speaking the authoritative conclusions of the United States supreme court; authority which a United States district court, if so disposed, cannot properly disregard. The doctrine, as asserted by him, no American court or jurist can justly question. It is a correct and clear exposition of the law: \u201cCourts, which originate in the common law, possess a jurisdiction which must he regulated by the common law, until some statute shall change their established principles; but courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction. It is unnecessary to state the reasoning on which this opinion is founded, because it has been repeatedly given by this court, and with the decisions heretofore rendered on this point, no member of the bench has ever for an instant been dissatisfied. The reasoning from the bar in relation to it, may be answered by the single observation that for the meaning of the term \u2018habeas corpus' resort may unquestionably be had to the common law, but the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the United States must be given by written law. This opinion is not to be considered as abridging the power of courts over their own officers, or to protect themselves and their members from being disturbed in the exercise of their functions; it extends only to the power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals, or between the government and individuals. To enable the court to decide on such question, the power to determine it must be given by written law.\u201d Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch [8 U. S.] 93.\nThird. That written law is found in the act of 24th September, 1789, \u00a7 14 (1 Stat. 81), commonly known as the \u201cJudiciary Act,\u201d and in the act of 2d March, 1S33, \u00a7 7 (4 Stat. 634), usually denominated the \u201cForce Bill.\u201d The history of each of those statutes is familiar to all, and suggestive of profound thought. The section in the act of 1833, conferring upon United States judges increased power to proceed by habeas corpus, was not by the terms of that act made temporary, whilst many of its other provisions were expressly limited in their operation to the end of the next session of congress then ensuing. The grave questions which have arisen within the last ten years, as to the scope of the powers granted to the United States judges by that act, will be alluded to in another part of this opinion. It is sufficient now, to consider, first, the act of 17S9. Before analyzing this act and ascertaining its true construction, it may be well to remark that the case of U. S. v. French [Case No. 15,165], cited by counsel, decides nothing more than was afterwards directly held by the United States supreme court in Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. [44 U. S.] 103, viz.: That when a \u201ccommitment\u201d is known to be under state authority, the United States courts and judges have no power to issue the writ of habeas corpus, and hear the cause. In the case of Wilson v. Izard [Case No. 17,810], the United States court took jurisdiction where the petitioner was restrained by authority of his enlistment in the United States service; and similar cases occur each year. In none of those cases is there, it is apprehended, any technical commitment; yet in the many acts of congress upon the subject of enlistment, there may be, in addition to the act of 3d March, 1799 [1 Stat. 749], similar provisions of a special character, conferring jurisdiction upon United States district and state judges, to hear applications for this writ in such matters, or in cases arising under such statutes. As time has not permitted an examination of all those acts, to ascertain what are still in force with reference to the discharge of soldiers from enlistment in the regular army, and as the judiciary act seems perfectly clear, it is not necessary', for the case before the court, to pursue that collateral inquiry. If there be no such special statutes, and Wilson v. Izard [supra], was decided by the United States circuit court for New York, by virtue of the authority granted in the act of 1789, then that case is directly in point. The act of 1789 seems sufficiently explicit, of itself. When the history of this writ, and the views of those who framed the United States constitution and the act of 1789. are considered, there is scarcely room for doubt. The legal controversy leading to the American Revolution, and the persistent demand of the colonists that they were entitled to the privileges of Englishmen, among which they claimed that of the habeas corpus as inestimable in value \u2014 \u201cthe inheritance of the free born subject\u201d \u2014 would induce the belief, that among the first acts passed by those patriotic statesmen would be one securing those privileges to as full an extent, at least, as they had insisted upon them whilst subjects of England. And so they did. In the constitution they inserted a direct prohibition against the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, \u201cunless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\u201d \u2014 being careful to use the very words they had employed during their ante-revolutionary straggle with England \u2014 the privilege of the writ, and not merely the writ itself. They struck deeper than the form, and insisted upon the substance \u2014 the underlying principle \u2014 the privileges for the vindication of which that writ had been immemorially used. The history of the American colonies, as well as of England, furnishes the amplest commentaries upon the part that writ has performed in every struggle for freedom. The act of 1789 has received the deserved encomiums of all eminent American jurists for its perspicuity and comprehensiveness \u2014 second only in those respects to the precise language of the constitution itself. It would be, indeed strange, if in the organization of judicial tribunals, the members of the first congress had overlooked the importanceof that writ, or had virtually suspended it, or fatally impaired the privileges it secures in the many and essential cases where arbitrary authority might act without warrant, or \u201cdue process of law.\u201d And still stranger would it appear when it is remembered, that at its first session that very congress proposed for adoption the first ten amendments to the constitution, the fifth of which declares that \u201cno person * * * shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\" \u2014 words which Justice Curtis, delivering the opinion of the United States supreme court in Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Co., 18 How. [59 U. S.] 276, said \u201cwere undoubtedly intended to convey the same meaning as the words \u2018by the law of the land\u2019 in Magna Charta.\u201d Still, if the act of 1789, by omission or otherwise, is as narrow in its limitations as contended for, no degree of surprise thereat can supply its omissions or change its terms. It must be talien as it is written, and fairly construed. The 14th section is as follows: \u201cAnd be it further enacted, That all the before-mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law. And that either of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district courts, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment. Provided, that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless where they are in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.\u201d 1 Stat. 81.\nIf there had never been a judicial exposition of that act, the student of legal history could hardly mistake its force and effect. The first sentence gives to the courts all the power they possess; and the second vests in the United States judges all the authority they have over the writ. It is well known how earnestly it was once contended that the United States courts, or at least the United States supreme court, had no authority to issue the writ, \u201cexcept when necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction\u201d in some case actually pending before it. And as the supreme court, by the terms of the constitution, has no original jurisdiction except in \u201ccases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party;\u201d and as the writ of liberty \u2014 the habeas corpus ad subji-ciendum \u2014 can scarcely be applicable to the exercise of its jurisdiction in any case already before it, on appeal; and as it has no appellate power given in criminal cases, it would have followed inevitably from that narrow construction, that it could deliver from unlawful restraint foreign ambassadors, ministers and consuls, but no American citizen. And still worse, upon that construction, the United States circuit or district courts could never use the writ for the great remedial purposes for which it had always existed \u2014 no federal court would have the needed power. Having thus construed away the power of the United States courts as to the most beneficial purposes of the writ, the judges of those courts would be left at chambers with an authority which the courts could never exercise, but an authority more limited than any British judge ever had at common law from the days of King John-even under the worst of the Tudors or Stuarts. But the language of the first sentence is not so narrow. The restriction has no application to the writs of habeas corpus and scire facias, but merely to \u201cthe other writs\u201d referred to. The power granted to the United States courts by that act is as broad as if it read: they \u201cshall have power to issue the writs of scire facias and habeas corpus agreeable to the principles and usages of law\u201d \u2014 principles and usages as well understood as the meaning of the words \u201cdue process of law\u201d in the fifth amendment to the constitution. And so on the Trial of Bun [Case No. 14.093], Chief Justice Marshall held: \u201cThe principles and usages of law mean those general principles and usages which are to be found, not in the legislative acts of any particular state, but in that generally recognized and long established law which forms the substratum of all the laws of every state.\u201d\nBut is there no limit to the powers of the United States courts? May they override all state process, judgments and decrees, and virtually discharge prisoners in custody for violation of state laws? If there were no provision on the subject in the act of 1789, still the reasonable construction would necessarily be, that the United States courts can take no jurisdiction beyond the range of federal authority \u2014 that they must confine their action within the purview of federal jurisdiction, and not interfere with cases belonging exclusively to the states. But the proviso to the second section has always been held, and with manifest correctness, to limit the courts as well as the judges at chambers. That proviso was for the express purpose of preventing conflicts between federal and state authority \u2014 of confining the United States courts and judges within their appropriate spheres. On any other construction, we should have the strange anomaly of a statute conferring upon an individual judge at chambers, a power which congress was unwilling to entrust even to the supreme court of the United States, or to a circuit court. A district court, held by the district judge alone, in open term, could not do what the same judge by stepping down from the bench, could quietly do at chambers, and that, too, in a matter involving the liberties of the American people, within the purview of the United States authority. Any fair construction of the act of 1789, whilst extending the proviso of the second sentence to the whole section, and forbidding federal courts as well as judges from interfering with the legitimate authority of state tribunals, gives to both courts and judges power to inquire into every \u201ccause or commitment under or by color of the authority of the United States;\u201d not narrowing them down to cases of technical or formal arrests by judicial process and leaving them powerless when arbitrary will, assuming to act in the name of the United States, chooses to trample upon every constitutional guaranty for the protection of individual liberty. If process issued from a judicial officer of the United States government, the citizen would have at least the assurance that such officer could not, without the grossest and most palpable violation of his sworn duty, proceed except by \u201cdue process of law,\u201d yet if he is left remediless where his liberties are trodden down without any legal process whatsoever, he would be delivered over to the tender mercies of every federal officer who chooses to outrage his constitutional rights \u2014 his \u201cinheritance as a free-born subject.\u201d\nReference was made by counsel to contemporaneous histoiy for aid in construing this act. Such reference is always legitimate where there is any obscurity in the terms employed; and so is the other rule, also invoked, that the use of a technical term in a statute is supposed to carry with it its technical meaning and application. If the act of 17S9 is tested by these rules the same result, already indicated, is just as clearly reached. The ante-revolutionary. controversies of a legal character, together with the debates in the British parliament upon those questions, furnish ample light to illuminate our pathway. It is not to be supposed that the American statesmen of the Revolution, who drafted the constitution and the act of 1789, were ignorant of the controversy which had just taken place in the British parliament with respect to this writ and its privileges; particularly as they had petitioned and remonstrated from time to time upon the same subject. The following compendious history of that parliamentary struggle, if resort is had to contemporaneous events, will most probably furnish the best guide to what was in the minds of the first congress when the judiciary act was passed: \u201cIn the year 1757, the above act of the 31 Car. II. c. 2 (habeas corpus act) came under discussion, in both houses of parliament upon the following occasion. A gentleman having been impressed before the commissioners under a pressing act passed in the preceding session, and confined in the Savoy, his friends made application for a writ of habeas corpus, which produced some hesitation and difficulty, for according to the above statute, the privilege relates only to persons committed for criminal, or supposed criminal matters, and this gentleman did not stand in that predicament. Before the question could be determined. he was discharged, in consequence of an application to the secretary of war. But the nature of the case seeming to point out a defect in the act, a bill for giving a more speedy remedy to the subject upon the writ of habeas corpus was prepared, and presented to the house of commons. It imported that the several provisions made in the above act (31 Car. II.) for the awarding of writs of habeas corpus in cases of commitment, or detainer for any criminal or supposed criminal matter, should in like manner extend to all cases, where any person, not being committed or detained for any criminal or supposed criminal matter should be confined, or restrained of his or their liberty under any color or pretence whatsoever, that upon oath made by such person so confined, or restrained, or by any other person on his behalf, of any actual confinement or restraint, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person so applying, was not by virtue of any commitment, or detainer for any criminal or supposed criminal matter, an habeas corpus, directed to the person or persons so confining or restraining the party, should be granted in the same manner as is directed, and under the same penalties ns are provided by the said act in the case of pea-sons committed or detained for any criminal or supposed criminal matter, that the person before whom the party should be brought, by virtue of an habeas corpus, granted in the vacation time, under the authority of this act, might and should, within three days after the return made, proceed to examine into the facts contained in such return, and into the cause of such confinement and restraint, and thereupon either discharge, or bail, or remand the party so brought, as the case should require, and as to justice should appertain. The rest of the bill related to the return of the writ in three days, and the penalties upon those who should neglect or refuse to make the return, or to comply with any other claim of this regulation. See the bill and the arguments for and against it, in the appendix to 7, Debrett\u2019s Debates, 1743-1774. The bill was soon passed by the commons, but in the house of lords it was thrown out at the second reading, and the judges were ordered to prepare a bill to extend the power of granting writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum in vacation time, in cases not within the statute of 31 Car. II. e. 2, to all the judges of his majesty\u2019s courts at Westminster, and to provide for the issuing of process in vacation time to compel obedience to such writs, and that in preparing such bill, they take into consideration whether in any and in what cases it may be proper to make provision that the truth of the facts contained in the return to a writ of habeas corpus may be controverted by affidavits of traverse, and so far as it shall appear to be proper, that clauses be inserted for that purpose, and that they lay such bill before the house, in the beginning of the next session of parliament.\u201d 3 Bac. Abr. Append, to Ha-beas Corpus.\nIt should be carefully observed that what thus occurred was almost coeval with the American struggle for independence. The bill which passed the house of commons was at first delayed in the house of lords until tlie opinions of all the judges at Westminster hall could be had in answer to the celebrated interrogatories propounded to them. Those answers were subsequently made. Upon the strength of the judicial opinions thus given,. Lord Mansfield caused the defeat of the bill in the house of lords, upon the ground that everything proposed in the bill was already the law just as indisputably and clearly as if that bill had ripened into an act upon the statute books of the realm. It was thus settled, in the opinion of the British judges and of the house of lords, just prior to the American Revolution, that \u201cthe privileges of the writ of habeas corpus agreeably to the principles and usages of law\u201d \u201cextended to all cases where persons not being committed or detained, &c., should be confined or restrained of his or their liberties under any color or pretence whatever.\u201d But American courts are no longer left merely to such modes of interpretation. The opinion of the United States supreme court was given upon the fourteenth section of the act of 1789 as early as 1807 by Chief Justice Marshall. Although the main point before that court had reference to its own character as an appellate court, except in the few eases already named; yet from that day to the present, the general views then expressed seem to have been recognized by all courts and judges as putting at rest every dispute about the extent of the power of the United States courts and judges, in cases of original jurisdiction, to issue the writ and inquire into the causes of illegal restraint where said restraint is \u201cunder or by color of the authority of the United States.\u201d To understand distinctly the views expressed by Chief Justice Marshall, it is necessary to keep constantly before the mind, the fact that the supreme court was considering in what cases that tribunal, as an appellate tribunal, and not a court of original jurisdiction, could issue the writ. As the constitution defined and limited its powers in original cases, manifestly no act of congress could enlarge them; yet the act of 1789 was, in terms, broad enough to give to that court the same powers over this writ as to the circuit or district courts, which possessed a more enlarged original jurisdiction. So anxious were the framers of the act of 1789 not to restrict the privileges of this writ, that they had seemingly given to an appellate court original jurisdiction. Hence the supreme court, defining its own powers under the restrictions of the constitution and not under the act of 1789, limits itself to cases pending in or decided by those courts over which it has ap- ' pellate or revisory power. It claimed a right to revise \u2014 a revisionary jurisdiction \u2014 over tribunals inferior to itself, or from whose decisions an appeal might ultimately be to the supreme court. In other cases of commitment \u2014 that is where the petitioner was imprisoned by other than United States district or circuit courts, it could not have jurisdiction because it had do appellate or re-visory power. If followed logically that it could not issue the writ where there was no commitment by any court; for there would then be no action of a court over which it had appellate jurisdiction, which could come before it for revision. Hence its decisions in the cases of Dorr, 3 How. [44 U. S.] 103, of Barry, in 2 How. [43 U. S.] 65, of Barry v. Mercien, 5 How. [46 U. S.] 103, and Ex parte Metzger, in Id. 176, and In re Kaine, 14 How. [55 U. S.] 103. But in [Ex parte Bollman] 4 Cranch [8 U. S.] 93, and [Ex parte Watkins] 3 Pet [22 U. S.] 201, that court states with sufficient distinctness its views of the case in which United States courts of original jurisdiction, and United States judges, have power to act, and also the scope of authority they possess. As the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in 4 Cranch [8 U. S.] 93, is full and demonstrative, the principal portion of it is quoted; with a repetition of the remark that the distinction between courts of appellate and original jurisdiction . must be borne constantly in mind whilst considering it:\nThe only doubt of which this section (14th section of judiciary act) can be susceptible, is whether the restrictive words of the first sentence limit the power to the award of such writs of habeas corpus, as are necessary to enable the courts of the United States to exercise their respective jurisdictions, in some causes, which they are capable of finally deciding. It has been urged that, in strict grammatical construction, these words refer to the last antecedent, which is \u201call other writs not specially provided for by statute.\u201d The criticism may be correct, and is not entirely without its influence; but the sound construction which the court thinks it safer to adopt, is, that the true sense of the words is to be determined by the nature of the provision, and by the context It may be worthy of remark, that this act was passed by the first congress of the United States, sitting under a constitution which had declared \u201cthat the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should not be suspended, unless when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety might require it\" Acting under the immediate influence of this injunction they must have felt, with peculiar force, the obligation of providing efficient means \u25a0by which this great constitutional privilege should receive life and activity; for, if the means be not in existence, the privilege itself would be lost, although no law for its suspension should be enacted. Under the Impression of this obligation, they give to all the courts the power of awarding writs of habeas corpus. It has been truly said that this is a generic term, and includes every species of that writ To this it may be added, that when used singly \u2014 when we say the writ of habeas corpus without addition, we most generally mean that great writ which is now applied for; and in that sense it is used in the constitution. The section proceeds to say, that, \u201ceither of the justices of the supreme court, as well as judges of the district court, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment.\u201d It has been argued that congress could never intend to give a power of this kind to the judges of this court, which is refused to all of them when assembled. There is certainly much force in this argument, and it receives additional strength from the consideration, that if the power be denied to this court, it is denied to every other court of the United States. The right to grant this important writ is given in this sentence to every judge of the circuit or district court, but can neither be exercised by the circuit nor district court. It would be strange if the judge sitting on the bench should be unable to hear a motion for this writ where it might be openly made and openly discussed, and might yet retire to his chamber, and, in private, receive and decide upon the motion. This is not consistent with the genius of our legislation, nor with the course of our judicial proceedings. It would be much more consonant with both that the power of the judge at his chambers should be suspended during his term, (hence, in this case, the adjournment from the judge at chambers to the court in term,) than that it should be exercised only in secret Whatever motives might induce the legislature to withhold from the supreme court the power to award the great writ of habeas corpus, there could be none which would induce them to withhold it from every court in the United States, and as it is granted to all in the same sentence and by the same words, the sound construction would seem to be, that the first sentence vests this power in all the courts of the United States; but as those courts are not always in session, the second sentence vests it in every justice or judge of the United States. The doubt which has been raised on this subject may be further explained by examining the character of the various writs of habeas corpus, and selecting those to which this general grant of power must be restricted if taken in the limited sense of being merely used to enable the court to exercise its jurisdiction in causes which it is enabled to decide finally. * * * \u201d\nAfter a masterly analysis of various forms of the writ, he proceeds:\nFourth and last, common writ, ad facien-dum et recipiendum \u201cwhich issues out of any of the courts of Westminister hall, when a person is sued in some inferior jurisdiction, and is desirous to remove the action into the superior court, commanding the inferior judges to produce the body of the defendant, together with the day and cause of his caption and detainer (whence the writ is frequently denominated a habeas corpus cum causa) to do and receive whatever the king\u2019s courts shall consider in that behalf. This writ is grantable of common right, without any motion in court, and it instantly supersedes all proceedings in the court below.\u201d Can a solemn grant of power to a court to award a writ be considered as applicable to a case in which that writ, if issuable at all, issues by law, without the leave of the court? It would not be difficult to demonstrate that the writ of habeas corpus cum causa cannot be the particular writ contemplated by the legislature in the section under consideration; but it will be sufficient to observe generally that the same act prescribes a different mode for bringing into the courts of the United States suits brought in a state court, against a person having a right to claim the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. He may, on his first appearance, file his petition, and authenticate the fact, upon which the cause is, ipso facto, removed into the courts of the United States. The only power, then, which on this limited construction would be granted by the section under consideration, would be that of issuing writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum. The section itself proves that this was not the intention of the legislature. It concludes with the following proviso: \u2018.\u2018That writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol unless where they are in custody under or by color of authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.\u201d\nThis proviso extends to the whole section. It limits the powers previously granted to the courts, because it specifies a ease in which it is particularly applicable to the use of the power by courts \u2014 where the person is necessary to be brought into court to testify. That construction cannot be a fair one which would make the legislature except from the operation of a proviso, limiting the express grant of a power, the whole power intended to begranted. From this review of the extent of the power of awarding writs of habeas \u25a0corpus, if the section be construed in its restricted sense, from a comparison of the nature of the writ which the courts of the United States would, on that view of the subject, be enabled to issue, from a comparison of the power so granted with the other parts of the section, it is apparent that this limited sense of the term cannot be that which was contemplated by the legislature. But the \u25a033d section throws much light upon this question; it contains these words: \u201cAnd upon all arrests in criminal cases, bail shall be admitted, except where the punishment may be death, in which case it shall not be admitted but by the supreme or a circuit court, or by a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of a district court, who shall exercise their discretion therein regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence, and of the evidence, and of the usages of law.\u201d The appropriate process of bringing up a prisoner, not committed by the court itself, to be bailed, is by the writ now applied for. Of consequence, a court possessing the power to bail prisoners not committed by itself, may award a writ of habeas corpus for the exercise of that power. The clause under consideration obviously proceeds on the supposition that this power was previously given, and is explanatory of the 14th section. If by the sound construction of the act of congress the power to award writs of habeas corpus in order to examine into the cause of commitment, is. given to this court, it remains to inquire whether this be a case in which the writ ought to be granted. \u25a0 The only objection is, that the commitment has been made by a court having power to commit and to bail. Against this objection, the argument from the bar has been so conclusive that nothing can be added to it. If, then, this were res integra, the court would decide in favor of this motion. But the question is considered as long since decided. The Case of Hamilton, is expressly in point in all its parts; and although the question of jurisdiction was not made at the bar, the case was several days under advisement, and this question could not have escaped the attention of the court. From that decision the court would not lightly depart U. S. v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 17. If the act of congress gives this court the power to award a writ of habeas corpus in the present case, it remains to inquire whether that act be compatible with the constitution. (Here the distinction is drawn between courts of appellate and of \u2022original jurisdiction.) In the mandamus case, Marbury v. Madison [1 Cranch (5 U. S.) 137], it was decided that this court would not exercise original jurisdiction except so far as that jurisdiction was given by the constitution. But so far as that case has been distinguished between original and appellate jurisdiction, that which the court is now asked to exercise, is clearly appellate. It is the revision of a decision of an inferior court, by which a citizen has been committed to gaol. It has been demonstrated at the bar that the question brought forward on a habeas corpus, is always distinct from that which is involved in the cause itself. The question whether the individual shall be imprisoned is always distinct from the question whether he shall be convicted or acquitted of the charge on which he is to be tried; and, therefore, these questions are separated, and may be decided in different courts. The decision that the individual shall be imprisoned, must always precede the application for a writ of habeas corpus, and this writ must always be for the purpose of revising that decision, and therefore appellate in its nature. But this point also is decided in Hamilton\u2019s \u2022 Case, and in Burford\u2019s Case [supra]. If at any time the public safety should require the suspension of the powers vested by this act in the courts of the United States, it is for the legislature to say so. That question depends on political considerations, on which the legislature is to decide. Until the legislative will be expressed, this court can only see its duty, and obey the laws.\nHence the supreme court took jurisdiction of the cause, because the commitment had been made by a United States circuit court, and therefore fell within the appellate or re-visory power of the former. It is by not attending carefully to the distinction between appellate and original jurisdiction, that the error is often made, of supposing this decision confines United States district and circuit courts and United States judges, to cases of technical commitments. That this decision, properly understood, goes as far as claimed in favor of issuing the writ where the restraint is under or by color of the United States authority, appears by the following extract from the opinion of the United States supreme court, in the Case of Watkins, 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 201, pronounced by Justice Story: \u201cNo law of the United States prescribes the cases in which this great writ shall be issued, nor the power of the court over the party brought up by it. The term is issued in the constitution as one which was well understood, and the judicial act authorizes this court and all the courts of the United States, and the judges thereof, to issue the writ for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of commitment This general reference to a power which we are required to exercise, without any precise definition of that power, imposes on us the necessity of making some inquiries into its use according to that law, which is, in a considerable degree, incorporated into our own. The writ of habeas corpus is a high prerogative writ known to the common law, the great object of which is the liberation of those who may be imprisoned without sufficient cause. It is in the nature of a writ of error, to examine the legality of the commitment. The English judges, being originally under the influence of the crown, neglected to issue this writ where the government entertained suspicions which could not be sustained by evidence; and the writ when issued was sometimes disregarded or evaded, and great individual oppression was suffered in consequence of delays in bringing prisoners to trial. To remedy this evil, the celebrated habeas corpus act of Car. II. was enacted for the purpose of securing the benefits for which the writ was given. This statute may be referred to as describing the cases in -which relief is, in England, afforded to a person detained in custody. It enforces the common law. This statute excepts from those who are entitled to its benefit persons committed for felony or treason, plainly expressed in the warrant, as well as persons convicted or in execution.\u201d Ex parte Watkins. 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 201.\ni'et the 33d section of that act provides as follows: \u201cUpon all arrests in criminal cases, bail shall be admitted, except where the punishment may be death; in which cases it shall not be admitted but by the supreme or a circuit court, or by a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of a district court who shall,\u201d &c. By virtue of that provision tlie supreme court, in the Case of Hamilton, 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 17, even admitted to bail the petitioner who had been, by a district judge, committed to jail for treason; the highest offence known to the law, and punishable with death. It would appear, therefore, that the privileges of this writ and the powers of the United States courts under it, are greater than were those of English courts and judges under the \u201chabeas corpus act\u201d (31 Car. II.)\u2014 as great, in fact, as the British judges and Eord Mansfield contended they were, during the parliamentary straggle already mentioned. It would seem clear that the framers of the act of 1789 had that struggle and its results in mind, and that such was the opinion of Judge Story and of the United States supreme court; for the habeas corpus act is pronounced by that court a mere enforcement of the common law, leaving- the privileges of the writ not to depend upon that British statute, but upon rights far above and beyond its provisions. The views of that court seem to be, that in the exercise of original jurisdiction, within the purview of federal authority, the circuit and district courts, as well as judges of the United States, may issue the writ and hear the cause, in all cases where, by common law, it could have been issued in England. In every case that has been before the United States supreme court, where allusion has been made to the subject, that extent of power has been taken for granted, as if beyond all dispute\u2014 as if it were a point too well and incontrovertibly settled to be even called in question. Without quoting from all the authorities in favor of that view, from Hamilton\u2019s Case, decided in 1793. down to the latest allusion in Howard\u2019s Reports, it may suffice to give the remarks of Justice Nelson in Ex parte Kaine, 14 How. [55 U. S.] 140, views from which, so far as this question is concerned, no one of the judges dissented. Justice Nelson thought the supreme court ought to take jurisdiction of the special case then under consideration, contending that a court subject to the revisory power of the former tribunal had given a decision which, in its appellate character, that tribunal could review. Nowhere was the power of United States courts of original jurisdiction doubted. \u201cThat case (Hamilton\u2019s Case), as understood and expounded in the Case of Bollman, in 1807, which received the most deliberate consideration of the court, and to which the doctrine of Hamilton\u2019s Case was applied, held that this great writ was within the cognizance of the court under the fourteenth section of the judiciary act, in all cases where the prisoner was restrained of his liberty, \u2018under or by color of the authority of the United States,\u2019 and no ease has held the contrary since that decision, with the exception of that of Ex parte Metzger, decided in 1847, which I have already stated stands alone, but which distinctly admits the power and jurisdiction of the court in the case before us. (The Case of Metzger, turned solely on the question of appellate power.) This writ has always been justly regarded as the stable bulwark of civil liberty, and undoubtedly in the hands of a firm and independent judiciary, no person, be he citizen or alien, can be subjected to illegal restraint or be deprived of his liberty, except according to the law of the land. So essential to the security of the personal rights of the citizen was the uninterrupted operation and effect of this writ regarded by the founders of the republic, that even congress cannot suspend it, except when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. I cannot, therefore, consent to cripple or limit the authority conferred upon this court by the constitution and laws to issue it, by technical and narrow construction; but on the contrary, prefer to follow the free and enlarged interpretation .always given when dealing with it by the courts of England, from which country it has been derived. They expound the exercise of the power benignly and liberally in favor of the deliverance of the subject from all unlawful imprisonment; and when restrained of his liberty, he may appeal to the highest common law court in the kingdom to inquire into the cause of it. So liberally do the courts of England deal with this writ, and so unrestricted is its operation in favor of the security of the personal rights of the subject, that the decision of one court or magistrate upon the return of it. requiring the discharge of the prisoner, is no bar to the issuing of a second, or third, or more, by any other couit or magistrate having jurisdiction of the case. and it may remand or discharge according to its judgment, upon the same matters. 13 Mees. & W. 679; 9 Adol. & E. 731; 1 East, 314; 14 East, 91; 2 Salk. 503; 5 Mees. & W. 47. Upon the whole, I am satisfied that the prisoner is in confinement under the treaty and act of congress without any lawful authority. 1 am of opinion, therefore, that the writ of habeas corpus should issue in the case, to bring up the prisoner.\u201d\nNo question was made as to the power and efficiency of the writ, or as to the jurisdiction of any court not restricted by the constitution to the exercise of appellate power. The only point of difference, it will be observed, was on the appellate question.\nSome of the cases cited by counsel have been overruled, and some do not touch the subject under investigation. The case in Taine\u2019s Keports [Wilson v. Izard, Case No. 17,810] and the case in 3 Pet. 201, have already been noticed. In no ease known and accessible to this court, has it ever been held that United States courts of original jurisdiction cannot issue the writ where a person is held in illegal restraint under or by eolor of the authority of the United States,' whether there has been a technical \u201ccommitment\u201d or not. The opinion of Judge Betts, cited by counsel in Barry v. Mercien, 5 How. [46 U. S.] 103, was undoubtedly correct. The legal proposition involved in his decision has long perplexed both federal and state courts. The various branches of that subject have, of late years, undergone elaborate discussion, viz.: Is there in either the federal government or in any state government a power, parens patriae, similar to that existing in England, either to make appointments to charitable uses in certain cases, or to control the custody of children, &c. \u2014 and if so in what department of government is the power lodged and to what extent? A very different subject from that now here. The decisions on this jurisdictional question already referred to, though sufficient of themselves, are by no means the most pointed. The case of U. S. v. Green [Case No. 13,256], is passed without especial comment, because the views of Judge Story, then expressed on the principal point considered, were overruled in 3 How. [44 U. S.] 103, although the decision of that eminent jurist on most of the subjects before him, at that time, are still unquestioned law. Ex parte Smith [Case No. 12,968], involved an inquiry into an executive warrant under color of the authority of the United States, and the jurisdiction was upheld by Judge Pope. The doctrines laid down in that case are not wholly inapplicable to the subject before this court; but as more direct decisions are to be found, it is unnecessary to pause for an analysis of that opinion. In Ex parte Jenkins [Id. 7,259]; Ex parte Robinson [Id. 11,935]; U. S. v. Morris [Id. 15,811], and Thomas v. Crossin [5 Clarke [Pa.] 328], \u2014 the United States judges or courts not only issued the writ of habeas corpus where there were commitments by state process, but where it did not appear on the face of the warrant that the process was under any color of authority of the United States. That course was held by the learned judges who issued the writs, to be not only permissible under the act of 1833, but to be an imperative duty. They even went behind the terms of those warrants or \u201ccommitments,\u201d and after proofs, aliunde, decided that as the commitments were illegal and for acts done under the authority of the United States, it was their duty to discharge the prisoners. True, the supreme court of Pennsylvania questioned the jurisdiction of the United States courts in such cases. But as that point is not involved here, it is not necessary to go into any inquiry concerning the scope of the acts of 1833 and 1789 under such circumstances. Suffice it to say, that in each instance where the federal courts have been compelled to act under the law of 1833, so far as is known, they have not failed to exercise and enforce their authority in cases similar to those just mentioned. Judge McLean and Judge Grier, of the supreme court, have given elaborate, convincing and sound decisions upon that subject: the correctness of which Judges Leavitt, Kane, and Miller, of the district courts, have not hesitated to put into practical application, despite local excitement, prejudices and resistance. In the case of U. S. v. Williamson [Case No. 16,725], Judge Kane, of the United States district court for the Eastern district of Pennsylvania, issued this writ where the cause of detainer was not alleged to be under or by color of any process whatsoever, or of the authority of the United States. The petitioner\u2019s slaves were seized by respondent, or by a mob at his instigation, as was charged, whilst they were passing through Philadelphia; and were so seized without any process, commitment or color of authority. The respondent of his own motion and by his mere arbitrary act, interfered with and detained from their master, his slaves whilst in transit, and as was contended, in violation of petitioner\u2019s rights under the constitution and laws of the United States. That pure and able judge did not hesitate about what his official duty demanded. The writ was issued. The respondent made an evasive if not false return, and was imprisoned for contempt. Subsequently he applied to Chief Justice Lewis, of Pennsylvania, for a writ to procure his discharge; one ground of the application being Judge Kane\u2019s want of jurisdiction. Chief Justice Lewis refused the writ. At the following term of the supreme court of that state, a similar application was made, fully argued and considered, but that court also refused to grant him any relief. Although the main point before the supreme court of Pennsylvania was as to the conclusiveness of the judgment for contempt, yet it is evident from the opin ions given, and the dissenting views of Judge Knox, that the jurisdictional question was also duly weighed and settled. A brief extract from the opinion of the supreme court of that state by Black, J., wilj give its general views: \u201cIt is argued that the court (United States district court) had no jurisdiction because it was not averred that the slaves were fugitives, but merely that they owed service by the laws of Virginia. Conceding for the argument's sake that this was the only ground on which the court could have interfered \u2014 conceding, also, that it is not substantially alleged in the petition of Mr. Wheeler \u2014 the proceeding was, nevertheless, not void for that reason. The federal tribunals, though courts of limited jurisdiction, are not \u25a0 inferior courts. Their judgments, until reversed by the proper appellate court, are valid and conclusive upon the parties, though the jurisdiction be not alleged in the pleadings nor on any part of the record. [M\u2019Cormick v. Sullivant] 10 Wheat. [23 U. S.] 192. Even if this were not settled and clear law, it would still be certain that the fact on which jurisdiction depends need not be stated in the process. The want of such a statement in the body of the habeas corpus, or in the petition on which it was awarded, did not give Mr. Williamson a right to treat it with contempt. If it did, then the courts of the United States must set out the ground of their jurisdiction, in every subpoena for a witness, and a defective or untrue averment will authorize a witness to be as contumacious as he sees fit.\u201d Again: \u201cI say the writ was legal, because the act of congress gives to the courts of the United States the power to \u2018issue writs of habeas corpus when necessary for the exercise of their jurisdiction, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.\u2019 A part of the jurisdiction of the district court consists in restoring fugitive slaves; and the habeas corpus may .be used in aid of it when necessary.\u201d 26 Pa. St. 21.\nWithout stopping to inquire into the correctness of the reasoning used, or indorsing it in all its length and breadth, the opinion indicates how far jurists think the United States courts can go in upholding federal jurisdiction over this great writ In the act of 1850 [9 Stat. 462] there is no express provision on the subject, and it is well known that one of the principal objections taken to that statute was in consequence of that omission. If either party could come before a court on that writ, then the questions sought to be reached by the objectors might be brought before the courts in some cases, at the place of capture. Hence that statute furnishes no explanation of the course of Judge Kane, nor was his action based upon its provisions. As will be seen hereafter, he placed his jurisdiction on other grounds. The separate opinion of Judge Uowrie, and the points of dissent by Judge Knox (the latter to be found in Williamson\u2019s Case [26 Pa. St. 9]), show that the question of Judge Kane's jurisdiction in issuing the writ was fully before the supreme court of Pennsylvania. Judge Knox took this ground: \u201cThat where a person is imprisoned by an order of the judge of the district court of the United States for refusing to answer a writ of habeas corpus, he is entitled to be discharged from such imprisonment if the judge of the district court had no authority to issue the writ.\u201d Still he was not discharged. It is true, the court put the case mainly on another question \u2014 one sufficient to prevent his discharge \u2014 yet the jurisdictional proposition was discussed, and by the chief justice upheld in favor of the United States district court, in that very case. In his opinion, the chief justice expressed the following views: \u201cThe habeas corpus is a common law writ, and has been used in England from time immemorial, just as it is now. The statute of 31 Car. II. c. 2, made no alteration in the practice of the courts in granting these writs. 3 Barn. & Ald. 420; 2 Chit. 207. It merely provided that the judges in vacation should have the power which the courts had previously exercised in term time (1 Chit. Gen. Prac. 686) and inflicted penalties upon those who should defeat its operation. The common law upon this subject was brought to America by the colonists, and most, if not all, of the states have since enacted laws, resembling the English statute of Charles II. in every principal feature. The constitution of the United States declares that \u201cthe privilege of a writ of ha-beas cox-pus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\u201d Congress has conferred upon the federal judges the power to issue such writs according to the principles and rules regulating them in other courts. Seeing that the same general principles of common law on this subject prevail in England and America, and seeing also the similarity of the statutory regulation in both countries, the decisions of the English judges, as well as of the American courts, both state and federal, are entitled to our fullest respect, as settling and defining our powers and duties. ****** The district court of the United States is as independent of us, as we are of it \u2014 as independent as the supreme court of the United States is of either. What the law and constitution have forbidden us to do directly on writ of error, we, of course, cannot do indirectly by habeas corpus. But the petitioner's counsel have put his case on the ground that the whole proceeding against him in the district court was corana non judiee, null and void. It is certainly true that a void judgment may be regarded as no judgment at all, and every judgment is void' which clearly appears on its own face to have been pronounced by a court having no jurisdiction or authority on the subject matter. For instance, if a federal coux-t should convict and sentence a eiti- zen for libel, or if a state court, having no jurisdiction except in civil pleas, should try an indictment for a crime, and convict the party, in these cases the judgments would be wholly void. If the petitioner can bring himself within this principle, then there is no judgment against him; he is wrongfully imprisoned, and we must order him to be brought out and discharged.\u201d\nThis case is by no means relied upon as conclusive, or as settling the question now under consideration. It is referred to mainly for the purpose of indicating the thoroughness with which the subject has been debated, and as introductory to the masterly reasoning of Judge Kane himself, when the whole doctrine again came before him for judicial review. That reasoning and his construction of the act of 1789 seem wholly incorrect, to the extent already stated in this opinion. As to the correctness of its application in the Wheeler Case, it is not necessary to determine here. It is sufficient if there is jurisdiction where the petitioner is under restraint \u2018\u2018by color of the authority of the United States,\u201d as is averred in McDonald\u2019s petition. The views expressed by the United States district court for the Eastern district of Pennsylvania, per Kane, J. (U. S. v. Williamson [supra]), are full and conclusive, so far as our present inquiry is concerned; and it is well to give them somewhat at length:\n\u201cThe writ of habeas corpus is of immemorial antiquity; it is deduced by the standard writers on the English law from the great charter of King John. It is unquestionable, however, that it is substantially of much earlier date; and it may be referred, without improbability, to the period of the Roman invasion. Like the trial by jury, it entered into the institutions of Rome before the Christian era, if not as early as the times of the republic. Through the long series of political struggles which gave form to the British constitution, it was claimed as the birthright of every Englishman, and our ancestors brought it with them as such to this country. At the common law it issued whenever a citizen was denied the exercise of his personal liberty, or was deprived of his rightful control over any member of his household, his wife, his child, his ward, or his servant. It issued from the courts of the sovereign, and, in his name, at the instance of any one who invoked it. either for himself or another. It commanded, almost in the words of the Roman edict, \u2018de libero homine exhibendo,\u2019 that the party under detention should be produced before the court, there to await its decree. It left no discretion with the party to whom it was addressed. He was not to constitute himself the judge of his own rights or of his own conduct, but to bring in the body, and to declare the cause wherefore he had detained it; and the judge was then to determine whether that cause was sufficient in law or not. Such in America, as well as England, was the well-known, universally recognized writ of habeas corpus. When the federal convention was engaged in framing a constitution for the United States, a proposition was submitted to it by one of the members that \u2018the privileges and benefits of the writ of habeas corpus shall be enjoyed in this government in the most expeditious and ample manner; and shall not be suspended by the legislature except upon the most urgent and pressing occasions.\u2019 The committee to whom it was referred for consideration, would seem to have regarded the privilege in question as too definitely implied in the idea of free government to need formal assertion or confirmation; for they struck out that part of the proposed article, in which it was affirmed, and retained only so much as excluded the question of its suspension from the ordinary range of congressional legislation. The convention itself must have concurred in their views, for in the constitution, as digested and finally ratified, and as it stands now, there is neither enactment nor recognition of the privilege of this writ, except as it is implied in the provision that it shall not be suspended. It stands then under the constitution of the United States as it was under the common law of English America, an indefeasible privilege, above the sphere of ordinary legislation. I do not think it necessary to argue from the words of this article that the congress was denied the power of limiting or restricting or qualifying the right, which it was thus forbidden to suspend. I do not, indeed, see that there can be a restriction or limitation of a privilege which may not be essentially a suspension of it, to some extent at least, or under some circumstances, or in reference to some of the parties who might otherwise have enjoyed it. And it has appeared to me, that if congress had undertaken to deny altogether the exercise of this writ by the federal court, or to limit its exercise to the few and rare cases that might peradventure find their way to some one particular court, or to declare that the writ should only issue to this or that class of cases, to the exclusion of others in which it might have issued at the common law, it would be difficult to escape the conclusion that the ancient and venerated privilege of the writ of habeas corpus had not been in some degree suspended, if not annulled. But there has been no legislation or attempted legislation by congress that would call for an expansion of this train of reasoning.\n\u201cThere was one other writ, which in the more recent contests between the people and the king, had contributed signally to the maintenance of popular right. It was the writ of scire facias which had been employed to vindicate the rights of property, by vacating the monopolies of the crown. Like the writ of habeas corpus, it founded itself on the concessions of Magna Charta; and the two were the proper and natural complements of each other. The first congress so regarded them. The protection of the citizen against arbitrary exaction and unlawful restraint, as it is the essential object of all rightful government, would present itself, as the first great, duty of the courts of justice that were about to be constituted. And if, in defining their jurisdiction, it was thought proper to signalize two writs out of the many known to the English law, as within the unqualified competency of the new tribunals, it would seem natural that those two should be selected which boasted their origin from the charter of English liberties, and had been consecrated for ages in the affectionate memories of the people as their safeguard against oppression. This consideration has interpreted for me the terms of the statute, which define my jurisdiction on this subject. Very soon after I had been advanced to the bench I was called upon to issue the writ of habeas corpus, at the instance of a negro, who had been arrested as a fugitive from labor. It was upon the force of the argument, to which I now advert, that I then awarded the process; and from that day to this, often as it has been invoked and awarded in similar cases that hare been before me. my authority to award it has never been questioned. The language of the act of congress reflects the history of the constitutional provision. * * * I am aware that it has sometimes been contended or assumed without. as it seems to me. a just regard to the grammatical construction of these words, that in the construction of these words the concluding limitation applies to all the process of the court, the two writs specially named among the rest; and that the federal courts can only issue the writ of habeas corpus. when it has become necessary to the exercise of an otherwise delegated jurisdiction; in other words, that it is subsidiary to some original or pending suit. It is obvious, that if such had been the intention of the law-makers, it was unnecessary to name the writ of habeas corpus at all; for the simpler phrase, \u2018all writs necessary. &c.,\u2019 would in that case have covered their meaning. But there are objections to this reading more important than any that found themselves on grammatical rules. The words that immediately follow in the section. give the power of issuing the writ to every judge for the purpose of inquiring into the causes of a commitment. Now. a commitment pre-supposes judicial action, and this action it is the object of the writ to review. Can it be, that a single judge, sitting as such, can re-examine the causes of a de-tainer, which has resulted from judicial action. and is therefore prima facie a lawful one: and yet that the court, of which he is a member, cannot inquire into the cause of a detainer, made without judicial sanction. I and therefore prima facie unlawful? Besides, if this were the meaning of the act, it might be difficult to find the case to which it should apply. I speak of the writ of ha-beas corpus ad subjiciendum, the great writ of personal liberty referred to in the constitution; not that modification of it which applies specially to the case of a commitment, nor the less important forms of habeas corpus ad respondendum, ad faciendum, &c., which are foreign to the question. I do not remember to have met a case, either in practice or in the books, where the writ ad sub-jiciendum could have performed any pertinent office in a pending suit. There may be such, but they do not occur to me; and I incline very strongly to the opinion, that if the power to issue the writ of habeas corpus applies only to cases of statutory jurisdiction, outrages upon the rights of a citizen can never invoke its 'exercise by a federal court. If such were indeed the law of the United States, I do not see how I could escape the conclusion, that the jealousy of local interests and prejudice, which led to the constitution of federal courts, regarded only disputes about property; and that the liberty of a citizen, when beyond the state of his domicil, was not deemed worthy of equal protection. From an absurdity so gross as this, I relieve myself by repeating the words of Chief Justice Marshall in Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 201: \u2018No law of the United States prescribes the cases in which this great writ shall be issued, nor the power of the court over the party brought up on it.\u2019 Whether, then, I look to the constitution and its history, or to the words or the policy of the act of congress, I believe that it was meant to require of the courts of the United States, that they should dispense the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus to all parties lawfully asserting them, as other courts of similar functions and dignity had immemorially dispensed them at the common law. The congress of 17S9 made no definition of the writ, or of its conditions or effects. They left it as the constitution left it, and as it required them to leave it, the birthright of every man within the borders of the States; like the right to air. and water, and motion, and thought; rights imprescriptible and above all legislative discretion or caprice. And so it ought to be. There is no writ so important for good, and so little liable to be abused. At the worst, in the hands of a corrupt and ignorant judge it may release some one from restraint who should justly have remained bound. But it deprives no one of freedom, and \"divests no right.\u201d\nThe following year (18DG) the same subject was considered in the United States circuit court for California, and the opinion given by Judge McAllister. The petition for the writ set out, that the petitioner (Dos Rockers) was an alien, that the supremo court of the state consisted of three judges: that two were essential for the transaction of business; that the petitioner had an important suit pending which his interest demanded should he speedily heard, but that It could not be heard because one of those judges (Heydenfelt) was absent from the state, and because another, the \u201cHon. David S. Terry is unlawfully restrained of his liberty against his consent, * * * and held by them in unlawful custody, and is not confined in any jail, nor by color of authority of any state, or of any magistrate thereof,\u201d &c.; and closed with the usual prayer for the writ, &c. Here it was not even averred that the prisoner was held \u201cunder or by color of authority of the United States,\u201d nor that there was any technical commitment. It negatived the idea, however, that he was restrained by any state authority. The writ was granted, on the following grounds: \u201cIt is an immediate remedy for every illegal imprisonment\u201d 1 \"Watts, 67. In a word, whenever a person has been deprived of going when, and where he pleases, and restrained of his liberty, he has a right to inquire if that restraint be legal, whether it be by a jailor, constable, or private individual. 2 Ashm. 247, cited in 4 Bac. Abr. 571. * * * This .great writ existed for all remedial purposes, not only anterior to the enactment of the habeas corpus act in England, but prior to the time of Magna Charta. In the reign of second Charles, the habeas corpus act was passed, to repel the aggressions of the crown and its minions. Those aggressions clothed themselves in the form of legal proceedings in the name of the crown, and hence the terms of the act were limited to persons confined on criminal process. But the habeas corpus, brought by our ancestors as their birthright, to this country, was the common-law habeas corpus; that great embodiment of a free principle, which, born with the sturdy Roman, preserved by the free Saxon, was so cherished by our imme\u25a0diate sires that they engrafted into our organic law the declaration, \u201cthat the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, &c. * * * The proposition, then, is established, both by federal and state authority, that in determining upon the nature and character of the habeas coitus mentioned in the constitution and judiciary act of the United States, regard is to be had, not to the limits prescribed by the British \u2022statutes, but to the more liberal principles in this particular of the common law by which it is regulated. By those principles it was issued in England to relieve any person from illegal restraint. Its operation in this country should not be less beneficent. It remains to consider to what extent the act of congress, giving to the federal judiciary the power to issue this great writ, has limited and controlled the cases to which at common law it confessedly applies. In doing so, we must bear in mind that we are fixing a construction which is to decide whether the federal courts are to extend to or withhold from persons a great constitutional right, in many cases to which the common law applies. No law, say the supreme court of the United States, prescribes the cases in which this great writ shall be issued, nor the power of the court over the party when brought up by it. The term used in the constitution is one well understood, and the judiciary act authorizes all the courts of the United States and the judges thereof, to issue the writ for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of commitment While it is evident that the proviso to the fourteenth section limits equally the powers of the courts and judges (admitted to do so by the court in the Williamson Case), it by no means follows that equalizing and restricting their powers as to persons in jail, has denuded them of all power, where they have jurisdiction of the parties, to relieve from illegal restraint, save in cases where the suffering parties are in jail under the authority of the United States. The proviso simply inhibits them from sending the writ to any persons in legal custody in jail, unless there under the authority of the United States. The alien or citizen of another state who is restrained of his liberty by lawless men, who is under no legal restraint, has a right to appeal to the laws of the country for relief. If in jail, or legal custody, not under color of authority of the United States, he is remitted to those laws which placed him there. This is, in my opinion, the true construction of the proviso, in which I am confirmed by the action of Judge Story, and by the opinions of the district judge of the district court of the United States for the Eastern district of Pennsylvania, and the supreme court of that state. It was in exercise of this jurisdiction that Judge Kane issued the writ in the Williamson Case. * * \u00bb These views are as sound law as they are eloquently expressed. In the case at bar, the applicant is an alien resident in this place, is not only interested in the matter to the extent that man concedes to sympathy with the oppressed, but is pecuniarily interested to a large amount. He is not in jail, nor in any custody known to the law, but held in restraint against his will, and in direct violation of those laws. Case of Des Rochers [Case No. 3.824].\u201d\nThis bases the petitioner\u2019s right apparently on the ground that he is an alien, interested in the liberty of the prisoner, and that the latter is held under unlawful restraint without any state authority. Nothing at all is said of a commitment It is well known that he was held by the mere arbitrary will of a mob organized under the name of a vigilance committee, and without any process, warrant, or any other legal authority. It was not considered necessary to the jurisdiction of that court, that there should have been a technical commitment, nor was it so held in the Williamson Case, nor has it been in any other case where a United States judge acts, or a United States court of original jurisdiction, so far as is known to this court. \u25a0\nEnough has been said, it is hoped, to demonstrate that the question of jurisdiction does not depend, in the slightest degree, upon the fact whether there has been a formal commitment or not, or whether the prisoner is in jail; but the sole inquiry is \u2014 whether he is held in unlawful restraint of his liberty \u201cunder or by color of the authority of the United States.\u201d The petition in this case so avers in express terms, and also negatives by apt words that he is held by any state authority or under any legal process whatever. The case, therefore, comes fully within what is deemed the true rule, and all correct adjudications. Whether the rule was correctly applied by Judge Kane or Judge Mc-Allister, it is not important to discuss; but it is certain, they held .it to extend much farther than there is any occasion for, to give this court unquestioned jurisdiction in the case now before it.\nFourth. To remove all shadow of doubt, only one step further need be taken \u2014 that is, to determine whether the state courts, (as contended by counsel,) have either exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. The United States supreme court has settled that point also. It solemnly decided in 1S3S, that the state courts have no jurisdiction whatsoever where the confinement is under the authority of the United States. . The opinion is too clear and important to be omitted. It was pronounced by Chief Justice Taney. The importance of the questions discussed by him, and the force of his reasoning furnish ample justification, for the length of the extract made: \u201cThere can be no such thing as judicial authority, unless it is conferred by a government or sovereignty; and if the judges and courts of Wisconsin possess the jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from the United States or the state. It certainly has not been conferred on them by the. United States, and it is equally clear it was not in the power of the state to confer it, even if it had attempted to do so; for no state can authorize one of its judges or courts to exercise judicial power, by habeas corpus or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and independent government. And, although the state of Wisconsin is sovereign within its territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the constitution of the United States. And the powers of the general government of the state, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States, is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by' a state judge or a state court, as if the line of division was traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye. * * * The constitution was not formed merely to guard the states against danger from foreign nations, but mainly to secure union and harmony at home, for, if this object could be attained, there would be but little danger from abroad; and, to accomplish this purpose, it was felt by the statesmen who framed the constitution, and by the people who adopted it, that it was necessary that many of the rights of sovereignty which the state then possessed, should be ceded to the general government; and that, in the sphere of action assigned to it, it should be supreme and strong enough to execute its own laws by its own tribunals, without interruption from a state or state authorities. And it was evident that everything short of this would be inadequate to the main objects for which the government was established; and that local interests, local passions or prejudices, incited and fostered by individuals for sinister purposes, would lead to acts of aggression and injustice by one state upon the rights of another, which would ultimately terminate in violence and force, unless there was a common arbiter between them, armed with power enough to protect and guard the rights Of all, by appropriate laws, to be carried into execution peacefully by its judicial tribunals. * * * We do not question the authority of a state court or judge, who is authorized by the laws of the state to issue the writ of habeas corpus, to issue it in any case where the party is imprisoned within its territorial limits, provided it does not appear, when the application is made, that the person imprisoned is in custody under the authority of the United States. The court or judge has a right to inquire, in this mode of proceeding, for what cause and by what authority the prisoner is confined within the territorial limits of the state sovereignty, and it is the duty of the marshal, or other person having the custody of the prisoner, to make known to the judge or court, by a proper return, the authority by which he holds, him in custody. This right to inquire by process of habeas corpus, and the duty of the officer to make a return. grows necessarily out of the- complex eharac-ter of our government, and the existence of two distinct and separate sovereignties within the same territorial space, each of them restricted in its powers, and each within its sphere of action prescribed by the constitution of the United States, independent of the other. But after the return is made, and the state judge or court judicially apprized that the party is in custody under the authority of the United States, they can proceed no further. They then know that the person is within the dominion and jurisdiction of another government, and that neither the writ of habeas corpus nor any other process issued under the state authority can pass over the line of division between the two sovereignties. He is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. If he has committed an offence against their laws, their tribunals alone can punish \u00abhim; if he is wrongfully imprisoned, their tribunals can release him and afford him redress. And although, as we have said, it is the duty of the marshal, or other person holding him, to make known, by a proper return, the authority under which he detains him, it is at the same time imperatively his duty to obey the process of the United States to hold the prisoner in custody under it, and to refuse obedience to the mandate or process of any other government, and consequently it is his duty not to take the prisoner, nor suffer him to be taken, before a state judge or court upon a habeas corpus issued under state authority. No state judge or court, after they are judicially informed that the party is imprisoned under the authority of the United States, has any right to interfere with him, or to require him to be brought before them. And if the authority of a state, in the form of judicial process or otherwise, should attempt to control the marshal, or other authorized officer or agent of the United States, in any respect, in the custody of his prisoner, it would be his duty to resist it, and to call to his aid any force that might be necessary to maintain the authority of law against illegal interference. No judicial process, whatever form it may assume, can have any lawful authority outside of the limits, of the jurisdiction of the court and judge by whom it is issued; and an attempt to enforce it beyond these boundaries is nothing less than lawless violence. Nor is there anything in this supremacy of the general government, or the jurisdiction of its judicial tribunals, to awaken the jealousy or offend the natural and just pride of state sovereignty. Neither this government nor the powers of which we are speaking were forced upon the states. The constitution of the United States, with all the powers conferred by it on the general government, and surrendered by the states, was the voluntary act of the people of the several states, deliberately done, for their own protection and safety against injustice from one another, and their anxiety to preserve it in full force in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to, or evasion of its authority, on the part of a state, is provided by the clause which requires that the members of the state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers of the several states, as well as those of the general government, shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this constitution. This is the last and closing clause of the constitution, and inserted when the whole frame of government, with the powers herein-before specified, had been adopted by the convention, and it was in that form, and with these powers, that the constitution was submitted to the people of the several states for their consideration and decision. Now, it certainly can be no humiliation to the citizen of a republic to yield a ready obedience to the laws as administered by the constituted authorities. On the contrary, it is among his first and highest duties as a citizen, because free government cannot exist without it; nor can it be inconsistent with the dignity of a sovereign state to observe faithfully, and in the spirit of sincerity and truth, the compact into which it voluntarily entered when it became a state of this Union. On the contrary, the highest honor of sovereignty is untarnished faith; and certainly no faith could be more deliberately and solemnly pledged than that which every state has plighted to the other states, to support the constitution as it is, in all its provisions, until they shall be altered in the manner which the constitution itself prescribes. In the emphatic language of the pledge required, it is to support this constitution. Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. [62 U. S.] 515.\u201d\nAs then the states have no authority in the cases named, it follows inevitably that, if the United States courts cannot proceed, the liberties of the people are hopelessly at the mercy of all lawlessness and violence, whether exerted by the arbitrary will of one man or many, whenever the oppressor acts under color of the authority of the United States \u2014 a condition worse than ever known in England since the days of Magna Charta, and wholly incompatible with the ide\u00e1 of civil or constitutional liberty. So far, however, is it from being true, that such is the deplorable condition of any American citizen, the reverse is the fact Every one who is illegally restrained of his liberty, under color of United States authority, has the fullest redress in the United States courts. Not only has he a constitutional right to apply for deliverance from illegal restraint, but it is the duty of the court to exhaust all its power to enforce his application.\nIn whatever light the question is viewed, the conclusion seems, to this court, to be irresistible; and therefore, without a shadow of doubt, it pronounces its jurisdiction in this case to be clear, positive, and ample."},{"case_name":"Davis v. Spencer","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2029521\/","date":"1862-03-01","court":"New York Court of Appeals","content":"Allen, J.\nThe judgment cannot be sustained upon the ground upon which it was put by the court below. By the \u25a0Bevised Statutes the Chancellor was charged with the care and custody of the personal estate of all idiots, lunatics, persons of .unsound mind and persons incapable of conducting their own affairs in consequence of habitual drunkenness. (2 R. S., p. 52, \u00a7 1.) The jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was a statutory jurisdiction and was exercised principally under the statutes conferring and regulating it. The court originally took jurisdiction of idiots and lunatics as the general delegate of the authority of the Crown as parens patriae, and by a special authority of the Crown under its sign manual. The jurisdiction was not inherent in the Court of Chancery, or the Chancellor as Chancellor. (2 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7\u00a7 1362-1364, 1335-1337.) The jurisdiction conferred upon the Court of Common Pleas, and in vacation upon the first judge of the county, to take jurisdiction of applications in cases of habitual drunkards made by the overseer of the poor, when the property of the drunkard was less than \u00a7250 in value, did not interfere with or divest the jurisdiction conferred generally upon the Chancellor, but simply authorized a special proceeding in a single and special case. (2 R. S., p. 52, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4.) The power of the Court of Chancery in these cases, from its long exercise, came to be regarded as a branch of its equity jurisdiction, and as of kin to that exercised by it over infants and others, the wards of the court. Under the Constitution of 1846 an entire new distribution of judicial powers was authorized, and the Court of Chancery was abolished and -its powers were delegated to other tribunals. General jurisdiction in law and equity was conferred upon the Supreme Court, and the legislature was authorized to confer equity jurisdiction in special cases upon the county judge,' and it was provided that the County Court should have jurisdiction in special cases as the legislature might prescribe. (Canst., Art. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 14.) In pursuance of this authority, in the first organization of the judiciary and the distribution of judicial power, the legislature, in the \u201cjudiciary act \u201d of 1847, enacted that the County Court should have equity jurisdiction, amongst other things, \u201c for the care and custody of lunatics and habitual drunkards residing in the county.\u201d (Sess. Laws of 1847, p. 328, \u00a7 31.) This act in respect to other parts of the. jurisdiction conferred -on the County-Courts, and within the same reason as this particular branch,to wit, the foreclosure of mortgages, partitions, &c., has been held to be constitutional. (Doubleday v. Heath, 16 N. Y., 80; Arnold v. Rees, 18 id., 57; Benson v. Cromwell, 26 Barb., 218.) The Code, taking the place of the judiciary act, gave the County Court jurisdiction in several special cases, and, among others, \u201c the care and custody of the person and estate of a lunatic or person of unsound mind, or an habitual drunkard residing within the county.\u201d (Code, \u00a7 30, sub. 8.) There is no restriction upon the jurisdiction, and the only-condition imposed is the residence of the person proceeded against within the county. In all other respects the jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the Supreme Court. It was not intended to continue the special and limited jurisdiction of the Common Pleas concerning habitual drunkards. It is conferred in different terms with a different limitation and embraces other objects, to wit, all persons of unsound . mind as well as drunkards. If the limit to the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas, as regarded proceedings against habitual drunkards, is deemed to attach to the same jurisdiction transferred to the County Court, the anomaly will exist of a jurisdiction conferred by the same clause and in the same words embracing two distinct matters, but of the same general character, in respect to one of which however it will be confined to cases where property of less value than $250 is involved ; and as to the other, there will be no such limitation. The anomaly will not be the less remarkable from the fact that no reference is made\" in the act to the value of property as an element of jurisdiction. The reference in the 11th subdivision of the same section, to the powers conferred, upon the Common Pleas, and the judges thereof, respecting habitual drunkards, was not designed and cannot have the effect to qualify.the jurisdiction conferred in other and more absolute and unqualified terms by the former subdivision. The subject of habitual drunkards was unnecessarily mentioned in subdivision 11, so far as proceedings thereafter to be commenced are concerned, but they were referred to for greater caution and to continue in the County Court, cases and proceedings which might have been commenced in the Common Pleas or before the first judge thereof; and for that purpose the reference to it may have been well. The County Court doubtless had jurisdiction to issue the commission and appoint the committee.\n' The judgment must be sustained, if at all, upon the report of and for the reasons assigned by the referee. The grant of general jurisdiction in the special cases mentioned by section 80 of the Code is utterly repugnant to the idea of a simple continuation and transfer of the restricted and very special jurisdiction of the Common Pleas under the Revised Statutes, and is not therefore affected by the saving provision of section 471 of the Code.\nThe referee has passed upon the question of fact involved \u2022 in the issue, and if there was any evidence his conclusions of fact are not re viewable by this court. They were not reviewed by the Supreme Court, by which tribunal alone they were revieyable. If there was no evidence, the decision would be erroneous in law. Comstock, J., in Hoyt v. Thompson's Executor, 19 N. Y., 212, says: \u201c Questions of fact are not before us.\u201d * * \u201c The distinction is, that the subordinate courts, in reviewing trials have the power of passing upon questions of fact as well as law, while the office of this court is to correct errors of law only.\u201d The referee has found an application of the indebtedness of Alva Davis to Williams, or Williams and Burger, with the assent of Burger, to the payment and satisfaction of the notes in suit. Upon that fact he predicates his conclusion of law that the notes were fully paid, satisfied and discharged. There was no error in the legal conclusion of the referee assuming the fact upon which it rested to have been established. Comyn\u2019s Digest, Accord, B. 4, lays down the proposition that \u201can accord with mutual provisions to perform is good, though the thing be not performed at the time of action; for the party has a remedy to compel the performance.\u201d This is not inconsistent with the principle .that an accord, to bar an action, must be executed. The mutual promises are regarded as the execution of the accord, the satisfaction of the original contract contemplated by the. parties. An agreement that a debt due or to become due. shall be deemed pro tanto, a payment on a debt, due from the creditor, operates. as a satisfaction. Nothing further is to be done by the parties in execution of the agreement ; the debt .is in judgment of law satisfied. When, by an agreement under seal between A and B, a controversy between them was submitted to arbitration, and it.was agreed that the sum to be awarded by the arbitrators in favor of B should be credited on a note which A held against B, it was held that the amount and award operated as a satisfac-. tian pro tanto of the note. (Hunt v. Clark, 12 John., 374.) So an agreement made after the giving of a note that a debt contemplated to be contracted by the payee with a third person, should be allowed in payment of the note, is a valid agreement, and the debt when contracted may be shown in payment of the note under the general issue. (Eaves v. Henderson, 17 Wend., 190.) Formerly there appears to have been a doubt whether an agreement to set off precedent debts operated as a payment, satisfaction or extinguishment. An accord that each of-the parties should be quit of actions .^against, -the other was-said not to be good because it was not any satisfaction. (Baa Abr., Accord, a.) But there is no difference in principle between-an agreement concerning debts, one of which is to be contracted in the future as in Eaves v. Henderson, and an agreement concerning debts already existing; and it has been decided that an-agreement to discontinue and a-discontinuance of cross actions for . false imprisonment constitute an accord and satisfaction, and bar another action- by either. (Foster v. Trull, 12 John., 456.) Whenever a.valid new contract-is--substituted:in-the place .of the old, as the. referee has found-was done in this .case, an aetionwill not lie -upon the .old contract, but. the remedy, of the parties is on the new or substituted agreement, although the transaction may not amount to a technical accord and satisfaction. (Good v. Cheesman, 2 B. & Ad., 328.) Where two brothers, A and B, principal and surety in an annuity, had, in an agreement between them and a third brother for the settlement of their affairs, declared that the bond was the debt of B, the surety, it was held that this agreement, whether subsequently acted upon or not, was a binding accord between A and B. (Cartwright v. Cooke, 3 B. & Ad., 701.) Hills v. Mesnard (10 Ad. & E. N. S., 266), is in principle not unlike Eaves v. Henderson (supra). The action was by payers against acceptors of a,' bill. The defendants became the acceptors for the accommodation of one Hundle, and the plaintiffs, the payees, agreed to appropriate certain moneys which they expected to receive in discharge of the bill. They subsequently received the money and the court held it a payment of the bill pro tanto. Lord Denman, Oh. J., says: it was competent for the parties to agree beforehand that the money should be specifically applied to the discharge of the liability on the bill yro tanto, \u201c and it seems to be the good sense of the transaction to treat it as so much money paid to the plaintiffs by Hundle on their account and as their agent.\u201d\nGardiner v. Callender (12 Pick., 374). is in point and decides that when E. H. B., one of the executors of A. S., gave to the executors of W. P. a memorandum as follows: \u201c It is agreed that the sum of $3,235, due from E. H. B. to the estate of W. P., shall be applied on a certain note for $6,000 now held by the representatives of A. S.,\u201d the memorandum amounted to a payment on the note and was not merely an executory agreement. The fact that a memorandum in writing was made of the agreement, does not vary its legal effect. It was not required by any law to be in writing. The court, as in Hills v. Mesnard, sought the good sense of the transaction, and to give effect to the sensible arrangement of the parties, holding that it could not be necessary in order to connect the one debt with the other by an agreement in present\u00ed, that there should be the vain formality of passing the money from one party to the other and returning it again to the party from whom it just came, or that a formal release or receipt should be executed. This case is not cited by counsel or alluded to.by the court in the subsequent case of Cary v. Bancroft (14 Pick., 315), but the latter was decided upon a ground which distinguished it from the former case; the court holding in the case last cited that the agreement was executory and not executed, requiring some further act to be done before the one note would operate as payment or extinguishment pro tanto of the other. Dehon v. Stetson (9 Met., 341), followed Cary v. Bancroft, and was decided upon the same ground. Another point was in the case, to wit: that one of the partners interested in the debt which it was sought to apply in payment as the individual debt of one of his partners, had not beemconsulted, and had no knowledge of the \"contemplated arrangement. Whether such consent was material or necessary is doubtful. See Wallace v. Kelsall (7 M. & W., 264), in which it was held, that to an action by three plaintiffs for a joint demand, a plea of an accord and satisfaction with one of the plaintiffs by a part payment in cash and a set-off of a debt due from that one to the defendant, was good without alleging any authority from the other two plaintiffs to make the settlement.\nThere was some evidence tending to prove the fact found by the referee. Evidence was given of the negotiation between the parties upon the subject, and what each party said, apd that all parties had acquiesced in the arrangement, or without any arrangement had suffered the debts to remain as they were, without attempting to enforce them for several years. Whether the minds of the parties met upon any terms, and if so what were the terms of such aggregatio mentium was a question of fact for the referee, whose conclusions are final in this court, not having been reviewed by the court below.' \u2022 He has found upon the evidence that the parties did' agree that the mutual debts should be applied in cancelment and discharge of each other, so far as they equaled each other in amount and to the amount of the smallest, and that without any further action by them \u2014 that is, that the agreement was executed, not executory. Whatever might be our conclusions upon the evidence, were we called upon to pass upon and declare the effect of it, we cannot say there was no evidence. Not only was there some evidence, but it was as strong, if full effect is given to the language proved by the witness, as it was in Gardner v. Callender.\nThe judgment must be affirmed.\nDavies, J., also .delivered an opinion for affirmance, and all the judges concurred.\nJudgment affirmed."},{"case_name":"James Tillinghast, Administrator, v. Benjamin A. Holbrook","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4813133\/","date":"1862-09-01","court":"Supreme Court of Rhode Island","content":"Brayton, J.\nThe plaintiff in this case was nonsuited, on the ground that, upon the conceded facts, he could not maintain an action for the note, and because the title to it had passed, before suit brought, to the heirs of the intestate, to whom it was payable, and not to her administrator.\nThe general rule is, that in order to maintain trover there must be in the plaintiff, at the time of suit brought, a property in the goods ; and that when the whole interest in the property converted passes, after the alleged conversion and before suit brought, to another person, and there be no special damage to the original owner, his right of action is gone. Philips v. Robinson, 4 Bingh. 106; 12 Moore, 368; Harrington v. Price, 3 B. & Ad. 170. It must be shown that there has been damage to the personal pro perty, or estate of the party, in his own hand while living, or in that of his executor or administrator, when dead; and the question here is, if, by the conversion, damage resulted to the personal estate of the intestate in her lifetime, or, since her death, to her estate in the hands of her administrator.\nThe property alleged to have been converted is personalty, and not realty; and by the rule of succession would, on the death of the intestate, pass to her administrator; and any suit for its conversion, either in the lifetime of the intestate or after her death, must be brought in the name of such administrator. The note, in this- case, was given by the defendant for the proceeds of certain real estate of the intestate, which she, being within the age of twenty-one years, was incompetent to convey. To enable her to do so, and to vest a good title in the purchaser, an act of the General Assembly was passed at the October session, 1852, empowering her, with her then husband, to make sale of the estate to the defendant. The authority to convey was granted upon this condition, \u2014 that the proceeds of the sale should be invested in this note, secured by mortgage, and payable to the intestate; and also, \u201cprovided, that said proceeds invested as aforesaid, or otherwise, shall descend and be inherited as the said real estate xvould have descended and been inherited.\u201d\nIt is claimed, that the moneys secured by this note, being the proceeds of the real estate sold and the note by which the payment is secured, passed immediately on the death of the intestate to such of her heirs at laxv as would have inherited from her the real estate, and not to her administrator. Had the land remained, and the owner died intestate, it would have passed to such of her heirs, by the table of descent, as were of the blood of the person from whom it came to her by gift or descent. Upon the conveyance, however, it became converted into personalty, as which, it is provided, that it shall be \u201c distributed amongst the heirs of the deceased in the same manner real estates descend and pass;\u201d \u201c but without any respect to the blood of the person from whom such personal estate came or descended.\u201d These proceeds, then, might, by the provisions of law, have gone to heirs of the intestate other than those to whom the land xvould have passed, viz.: to such of them as had none of the blood of the person from whom the land came. The purpose of this proviso evidently was, to prevent such result, and to provide that the moneys into which the land had been converted, notwithstanding such conversion, should go to the same persons to whom the land would have gone, if no such authority to convert had been granted by the General Assembly. The language of this proviso requires, that the proceeds of sale shall not pass to the heirs generally, but in ascertaining the heirs, respect shall be had to the blood of the person from whom the land came, if any persons of that blood remain. To whom the moneys are ultimately to go is sufficiently certain; the more important questionis, at what time the legal interest passes to the heirs, whether directly and immediately, on the death of the intestate, or mediately, to the same heirs, in the course of distribution. In either mode the object of the proviso is answered, and that equally. The last mode would not, as the first would, require us to disregard the statute provisions in regard to mortgages held by deceased persons. They provide, that money due by mortgage of real estate shall be considered personal property, and be included in the inventory as assets; that the administrator shall have the same control of the interest of the real estate mortgaged as he would of personal estate mortgaged ; that he may take the surrender of possession, or sue in ejectment for the seizin and possession of the real estate, and shall hold the possession to the use of the heirs, or of the devisee to whom it may be devised. He may sell it for the payment of debts, and if the mortgagor redeems after possession taken, he shall receive the redemption money for distribution or payment to the devisee, and may discharge the mortgaged premises by release, quitclaim, or other legal conveyance. To require a disregard of all these provisions, the language ought to be strong, and this construction become necessary in order to give effect to the words. All these provisions, however, may well enough be regarded and held applicable to the present note and mortgage, without diverting the mortgage money from those heirs who maybe of the blood of the person from whom the land came. If held not applicable, and the proceeds to' pass, not to the administrator but directly to the heirs, it would be doubtful, at least, if within any of the provisions of law they cou|d, as personalty, be applied to the\u2018payment of the debts of the intestate, even for want of general personalty for that purpose.\nThe language of the proviso does not, in our judgment, require this construction. Had the legislature never applied the terms \u201c descend \u201d or \u201c inherit,\u201d and the term \u201c heirs,\u201d to the succession by law to other than real estate, the language would have been more controlling, and the implication much stronger of an intent to impress upon this fund the character, and to give it all the incidents, of realty. In the public act we find the terms not so limited; on the contrary, personalty is to be distributed to heirs, and in the same manner as real estates descend: and in that distribution, no inquiry need be made from whom the personal estate descended,. \u2014 implying that it might descend, though it came by distribution. In no case, however, was it implied that the legal title was to pass, not to the administrator, but directly to the heirs. The word \u201c inherit \u201d being correlative in meaning with the word \u201cdescend,\u201d we may presume was used in the same sense, and does not strengthen the language in this respect. Regarding, then, the language of the public act in this' respect, it seems sufficient, in order to give effect to the words and to the object and purpose of the proviso, to hold, these proceeds, and the note and mortgage, to be what the statute declares mortgages of real estate shall be,---part of the personal property of the deceased, to be included in the inventory, \u2014 and giving the right to the administrator to sue for the debt secured, or for'the possession of the estate mortgaged; but, nevertheless, that the proceeds of sale shall not pass to any others of the heirs of the intestate than such as are of the blood, &c., while any heirs of that blood remain. This is the only incident of realty which the proviso seems to have impressed upon this fund. The only purpose or necessity for the provision at all was, to provide for the succession of such heirs, if any such there should be; and if that blood failed, it never could have been the purpose to take this property out of the regular course of distribution.\nThe nonsuit ordered in this suit must be set aside, and a new trial granted, the defendant, in any event, to recover no costs of this motion.\nAt the March term of the court, 1862, the new trial of the case was had before Brayton, Justice, with a jury, when, in addition to the facts reported as proved at the first trial, it appeared, that the said Emily A. Simmons was born on the first day of September, 1885, and had just reached her seventeenth year when authorized by the General Assembly to sell her real estate as aforesaid, and to receive therefor the note and mortgage of the defendant; that in the month of May, 1858, she procured a divorce from her husband, Simmons, and shortly afterwards intermarried with Hiram A. Olney. Being a person of loose habits, she afterwards separated from her second husband, Olney, and with her child, took up her residence with one Nehemiah Bucklin, whose house was a disrejrutable one. Whilst thus living apart from her husband, an infant and a married woman, the Municipal Court of the City of Providence, exercising probate jurisdiction, on the thirteenth day bf March, 1855, on the application of her husband and of her father, and after due notice and upon full hearing, appointed Stephen Martin of Providence her guardian, adjudging that she, for want of discretion in managing her estate, was likely to bring herself to want, and thereby to render herself chargeable to. the City of Providence. Martin duly qualified himself for his trust, and a letter of guardianship issued to him out of said court, but he never obtained possession of said note and mortgage, which remained in the hands of the said Emily A. Olney, his ward. From time to time, the defendant, Holbrook, paid to her the interest as it became due on said note, and, upon her. order, different sums of money, and, finally, in June, 1855, paid in full all that, deducting such former payments, was computed to be due upon the note, to the said Nehemiah Bucklin, who then held the same.\nEvidence was also submitted to the jury tending to prove that the said Emily A., whilst she and her child were living with said Bucklin apart from her husband and against the request of her guardian, and shortly before the transfer of this note, received the sum of four hundred dollars, which was at once squandered away; and that whilst there, she endorsed the note over to said Bucklin, the consideration of the transfer, in part, being the board of her self and child for about four months, and some money paid by Buclclin to her at the time of the transfer. In August, 1865, Emily A. Olney died, being a little less than twenty years of age. The plaintiff was duly appointed administrator on her .estate, and on the first day of February, 1868, demanded this note of the defendant, who'refused to deliver to Jbum the same.\nAt the trial, the counsel for the defendant requested the court to instruct the jury, that the note stred for was lawfully in the possession of the defendant, if they were satisfied from the evixdence-thathe had paid a valuable consideration therefor ; but the court refused so to instruct them, .and charged them, if they believed, from the evidence, that the said Emily A. Olney was a minor at the time she parted' with said note, and if they also believed that she died before attaining her majority, that her transfer of said note might have been avoided by her in her lifetime, and her representative, the present plaintiff, was entitled to avoid the same.\nThe counsel for the defendant also requested the court to instruct the jury, the note in question having come to the hands of the defendant through one Nehemiah Bucklin, for a valuable consideration, and it also appearing that the same was secured by a mortgage given by the defendant to the said Emily A., in conformity with the act of the General Assembly, passed at the October session, A. 13. 1852, that if the jury found that the defendant paid a valuable consideration for said note, he was lawfully entitled to'hold-the, same against the plaintiff. This instruction the court refused to give; but, on the contrary, charged the jury, that the note in question was a mortgage debt; and if they found that the said Emily\u2019A. was, at the time she parted with said note, the wife of Hiram A. Olney, and that he was then living, the defendant could acquire no title to the note, or right to hold the same against the plaintiff, unless the same was conveyed by a deed executed by the said Hiram A. and Emily A., his wife, in conformity to the provisions of Oh. 136, section 4, of the Revised Statutes.\nIt having appeared, that \/at the time the defendant became possessed of said note, the said Emily A., wife of the said Hiram A. Olney, had been, by a decree of the Municipal Court of the City of Providence, placed under the guardianship of Stephen Martin, who. had duly qualified himself to act in said trust, the court, at the request of the plaintiff, and against the objection of the counsel of the defendant, instructed the jury, that the said Emily A., though a married woman, could be legally placed under the disability of guardianship, for the cause stated in said decree ; and if the jury found that she parted with and endorsed said note, whilst under that disability, the defendant, claiming under such endorsement, was not entitled to hold the note against the plaintiff.\nThe counsel for the defendant further requested the court to instruct the jury, it having appeared that a portion of the consideration money paid by the defendant for said note was received by the said Emily A., she being within the age of twenty-one years, and a certain other portion of it was beneficially enjoyed by her in the way of board for herself and child for a period of four months, that if Emily A. OIney were alive, and after arriving at full age elected to avoid her transfer of the note, and commenced an action against the defendant to recover possession of the same, she would not be permitted to recover any greater amount of damages than the difference between the sum which she had so received and the amount of the note and interest from the time of the conversion; and if the jury believed the evidence as to the sum of money and other valuable considerations which she had received for said note from the defendant, the plaintiff, her administrator, had no greater rights than his intestate; and the jury should deduct from the amount of. the note, with interest from the time it came into the hands of the defendant, the sum which, under the evidence, the jury believed that she had received. The court declined to give this instruction, but charged the jury, that in assessing the damages, they might deduct from the amount of the note and interest all sums paid to the said Emily A. for the annual interest on said note; and if she had .been furnished with articles for the use of herself and child, and such articles were a part of the consideration for the transfer of said note, and the jury were satisfied, from the evidence, that the supplies furnished her were actually necessary for her or their use under the circumstances proved, the amount of such supplies should be also deducted from the amount of the note ; that when money has been furnished to an infant, in order to charge' him or her with the payment of it, it is necessary that it should appear from the evidence that it has been applied to the procurement of necessaries; and that if they found evidence to satisfy them that any money had been so supplied to the said Emily A., the amount so found might also be deducted.\nThurston & Sipley,for the defendants :\u2014\nI. The court erred in instructing the jury, as in the first cause of error is assigned. 1. This act of Mrs. Olney, in parting with the note, so far as the defendant is concerned, was not a contract either void or voidable. fily the act of the General Assembly, the note was expressly made payable to her, or her order, and the defendant could not have been, called upon for payment until the expiration of five years, but he was not debarred from paying it sooner; and if he could pay it- to Mrs. Olney, he could also pay it to any endorsee ; for the character of negotiable paper is given to it by the act of the General Assembly. 2. So far as the defendant was concerned, fie made no contract or bargain with Mrs. Olney; he simply paid his debt, and took up the evidence of it. If the plaintiff\u2019s theory is correct and the ruling of the court sound, the defendant would be responsible to Mrs. Olney\u2019s administrator after he had paid the money to Mrs. Olney herself, on the principle that a debtor cannot make payment to a minor. 3. The endorsement of the note to Bucklin by Mrs. Olney, and the payment of the note by the defendant; were upon the same day. Although the note had been previously pledged to Bucklin, Mrs. Olney received full value for it from Bucklin, from anything that appears to the contrary in the evidence ; and the defendant paid the full amount due upon it to Bucklin, so that, in substance, the payment of Holbrook was made to Mrs. Olney. 4. It is conceived that if it be held by the \"court, that the transfer to Bucklin of the note was avoidable act, then the remedy of the plaintiff should be pursued against Bucklin, and not against the defendant, who was only discharging an obligation. 5. Assuming that the transfer to Bucklin and the payment of the note by the defendant were acts which Mrs. Olney, on account of her minority, could repudiate, then the further question, of the assent of the plaintiff to the act of his intestate, should have been submitted to the jury, in view of the lapse of time before any step Avas taken to recover the note. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 237, and cases cited; 1 Am.

The court erred in the second particular assigned, in instructing the jury that a married woman cannot transfer a mortgage debt except by deed executed by herself and her husband jointly, and acknoAvledged by her separately. See Dig. of 1844, p. 270, \u00a7 2. The section referred to is aimed against husbands Avko seek to dispose of their Avives\u2019 property. It ought not to be construed to prevent a debtor from paying his debt to a feme covert, or even to debar her from legally parting with a mortgage debt, if she chooses so to do.\nIH. The court erred in the third particular assigned. 1. The act of the Municipal Court of Providence, placing a- guardian over the person and property of a married woman was a void act, and no disability accrued to Mrs. f01ney in consequence. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 226. In Aoc\u00edcAv. 6rarucro,l Ves. Sen. 157, the Chancellor said, that marriage ipso facto did not determine the guardianship, though the court could never appoint a guardian to a female infant under coverture. Reeves, on the Domestic Relations, 328, says : \u2014 \u201c Marriage by a ward in all instances affects the rights of a guardian more or less. If a female ward marry, the guardian\u2019s power must cease both as it respects her person and her property. This, I apprehend, has never been questioned when she married an adult, for such husband has a right to her person, with an uncontrollable right to her property.\u201d The office of a testamentary guardian determines on the marriage of a female ward. Mendes~v. J\u00ed\u00e9ra&s, 1 Ves. Sen. 89. 2. The unreasonableness and inconsistency of such a power is manifest from the fact, that, by the theory of the law, husband and wife are one and indivisible. During the coverture the wife is sub potestate viri, and it is not competent for him to delegate the custody of her person and tlie disposition of her property, to another. 8. This court has power to interpose between husband and wife, and appoint a trustee ; but if courts of probate can do this, the provisions of the law conferring this power on this court are a nullity. 4. But under the statute, the court of .probate has no power like this. Their authority is limited (Rev. St. CH. 138, \u00a77) to a case where the individual is liable \/to bring himself to want. Now, in the proceedings in this case, it is asserted that Mrs. Olney is the wife o'f Hiram A. Olney; no suggestion is made that he is liable to bring himself to want; and as the wife cannot be in danger of being, chargeable so long as the husband is in no danger of becoming so, there was nothing in this ease, within the statute, for the court to do.\nIV. The court erred in the fourth particular assigned. The privilege of minority is a shield, and not a sword. Upon the avoidance of a contract on this account, it is obligatory, both at law and in equity, upon the minor, \u00b1o restore all that he has received. In this case, she had received from Bucklin four months board, and the balance, in money; she had also received divers sums of money from the defendant, exhibited by receipts produced by the defendant; and the jury should have been instructed to allow all such sums so proved, and ought not to have been restricted to the consideration of those items only, which were absolutely necessary for her support. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 240; Badger v. Phinney, 15 Mass. 359 ; Khtehen v. Lee, 11 Paige, 107 ; Bmiih v. Evans, 5 Humph. 70; Breed v. Judd, 1 Gray, 455 ; Hillyer v. Bennett, 3 Edw. Chan. 222 ; Taft & Go. v. Pike, 14 Verm. 405 ;, Willis v. Twamhly, 13 Mass. 204 ; 1 Am. Lead. Cases, notes, p. 260, (4thxed.) and cases cited.\nJames .Tillinghast, with whom was BracJley,for the plaintiff :\nThe first exception cannot be sustained. The instruction was, certainly, sufficiently favorable to - the defendant. The act of Mrs. Olney in parting with this note, if not entirely void as we submit, was, under the circumstances, clearly voidable by her as a minor, and having died under age, the plaintiff is equally entitled to avoid it, in behalf of her estate. See 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 234, &c.; Willis v. Twamhly, 15 Mass. 204; Bing'h. on Infancy, (ed. of 1849,) 49, n. 1, and cases cited. Second exception. The instruction was correct. Our statute concerning the property of married women, itself stands in the place of the trust conveyance for her benefit, provided by the statutes of other states. She has, therefore, no powers over the estate, except those given her by the statute. Compare Metcalf v. Goolc, 2 E. I. 855. The statute gives her no power to coiivey, except by deed. Eev. St. Ch. 136, \u00a7 4 ; Stat. of 1844, p. 270, \u00a7 2. Any other construction of the statute would enlarge the wife\u2019s power over her estate to the destruction of the husband\u2019s rights therein, as secured by the act. Eor, apart from the statute, at common law, the title to this note could be passed only by the endorsement of the husband, made by himself or by his agent duly authorized, \u2014 the only difference, in case the wife acts as agent, being, that possibly (but of this quere \u00b6 the cases are conflicting) she may, in case of such a note as this, payable to her own order, make the endorsement in her own name; but it still operates as the husband\u2019s endorsement, not as hers. Her own endorsement made, as in this case, without his authority, is entirely void; in this all the cases agree. Barlow v. Bishop, 1 East. 432; Mil~ lerv. Delamater,\u00a5Z Wend. 433; Savage v. King, 17 Maine, 301; 1 Parsons on Contracts, 212. When, therefore, the statute takes away from the husband this right to make title by his endorsement, it equally takes away the power of the wife to do so ; and title can only, therefore, be made in the prescribed statute form, i. e., by the deed of both.\nThird exception. The probate guardianship over Mrs. Olney, as a person liable to bring herself to want, &c., under the statute, was valid, particularly as our statute, secure\u2019s to her, separate property, and the guardianship was granted at the request of her husband. It is similar to the well settled jurisdiction of the English Chancery over lunatics, though married women. See Stock on Law of Non. Comp. 95-122 ; In re Tomlinson, 1 Yesey & Beames, 57 ; In re Kewson, 13 Eng. Law & Eq. 197.\nFourth exception. This instruction was sufficiently favorable to the defendant. See'Bingh. on Infancy, 29, 30, and n. C.\nBratton, J.\nThe first ground assigned for a new trial is, that the jury were misdirected in this: \u2014 That they were charged that the intestate, an infant 'at the time of her death, might, during her life, have avoided her act in parting with the note in question, and that her representative', the present plaintiff, was entitled to avoid it after her death.\nAll contracts of an infant are, as a general rule, and, as it is said, almost as a universal rule, voidable; and may be avoided by him. See 1 Am. Lead. Cases, 248, and cases cited by the defendant; 3 Bac. Ab. 141; Hedgeley and wife v. Holt, 4 C. & P. 104. The negotiation of a promissory note was avoided in Nightingale v. Withington, 15 Mass. 272; and all the cases cited by the defendant recognize the right of the infant to avoid, at his election. It is equally well settled, that if the infant die within age, not having avoided the. contract, it may be avoided by his representative. Oliver et al, v. Houdlet, 13 Mass. 237; Slocum v. Hooker, 13 Barb. 536; Roberts v. Wiggin, 11 N. H. 73; Smith v. Mayo, 9 Mass. 62. This right is not affected by the act of the General Assembly authorizing the sale of the real estate, and the taking of the security for the purchase money. That act does not profess to remove any disability under which the intestate then was, either of infancy or coverture, further than was necessary for the sale and conveyance of the real estate, and securing the proceeds of the sale for-her and her heirs. Regarding the act of the defendant, in the view suggested by counsel, as a payment by him of a debt in anticipation, and before it fell due by the terms of the contract, it cannot defeat the right to avoid the act of the infant in transferring the note.\nThe defendant knew all the disabilities of the original payee of this note. He is the maker. He knew that he was paying (if we regard the payment made to her, and the payments to Bucklin as made to her) to an infant, and that he paid at his peril. If it were a legacy to be paid, and the defendant had paid it to an infant, the payment would have been void. Philips v. Paget, 2 Atk. 80, where the executor was compelled to pay a second time; and Sparhawk v. Buel, 9 Verm. 41, where payment of a legacy to a minor was held void. The rule is not confined to legacies. In Hedgeley and wife v. Holt, 4 0. & P. 104, the suit was for the wages of a servant, the plaintiff\u2019s wife, an infant. The defenc\u00e9 was, that she had been paid, \u2014 part in money paid for dresses, and the residue, moneys generally ; and Bayley, J., said, \u2014 \u201c Payments made for necessaries, and which could not be avoided, are valid payments ; but infants cannot bind themselves for things not necessary;\u201d and the plaintiffs were allowed to recover, deducting only moneys applied to purchase dresses,, holding, in effect, that the other payments were void. There is no case cited by the defendant which affirms that payment of money to an infant is valid, even when payable by the terms of the contract. The payment here claimed was not in performance of the original contract, but involved the discharge of it by a new agreement.\nThis note was made payable to the intestate, after she should have arrived at full age, \u2014 the interest to be jiaid to her annually, for her separate use. It was secured by mortgage. As a ground for a new trial, the defendant complains and says, that the instruction to the jury, that she, being a married woman, could not transfer this note, unless in the mode prescribed in Ch. 136, section 4, of the Revised Statutes, viz., by deed of her husband and herself, acknowledged by her apart'from her husband, was erroneous. Independent of the above act, entitled \u201cAn act concerning the property of married women,\u201d the endorsement of a feme covert would pass no interest in the note, and would not enable the endorser to maintain an action in his own name thereon. The property vesting in the husband, he becomes solely entitled to negotiate it as holder, and to endorse it in his own name. Story on Bills, \u00a7 196, Chit. on Bills, 25; Barlow v. Bishop, 1 East. 432. The act referred to does not enlarge the power of a married woman in this respect. It does not, by its terms, clothe her with the powers of a feme sole, or authorize her to sell or transfer, or to sue for or recover any of her property, without joining her husband. As to actions, it is expressly provided, that the husband shall join; and had a suit on this note been necessary in the intestate\u2019s lifetimeit must have been in the name of husband and wife. Eor her security, the act has put a restraint upon the husband\u2019s power over certain kinds of property of the wife, and among them, debts secured by mortgage. These are so far secured to her sole and separate use that they cannot be taken for the husband\u2019s debts; nor can they be sold, leased, or conveyed by the husband, \u2018\u2018 unless by deed in which the wife shall join as grantor,\u201d and acknowledged by her, as in case of tbe real estate of a married woman. This is now the only mode in which the husband can dispose of a debt of the wife secured by mortgage. This restraint upon the husband does not empower the wife to act alone, and to transfer it in her own name ;-.-and as he can only do it in the mode prescribed, she can only do it by joining him in that mode.\nThe third section of the act respecting guardians, contained in the Digest of 1844, p. 272, provides, that \u201cwhenever any idiot, or lunatic, or person non compos mentis, or any person who, for want of discretion in managing hispstate, shall be likely to bring himself and family to want, and thereby to render himself and family charg\u00e9able, shall reside or -have a legal settlement in any town, the court of probate of such town shall have the right to appoint a guardian of the person and estate of such person.\u201d The Municipal Court of the Cifr$L.of _Providence, exercising probate jurisdiction, upon the application in writing of Hiram A. Olney, her husband, alleging that the said Emily, his wife, was, for want of discretion in managing her estate, likely to bring herself and family to want, and thereby to render herself and family chargeable, upon hearing, after legal notice to her, adjudged the complaint to be true, and thereupon appointed one Stephen Martin guardian of her person and estate, who accepted the appointment, and qualified himself to act by giving the required bond. The application did not allege that her husband was unable to support her, or that he was spending his estate, or likely to come to want, and become chargeable. Section tenth of the same act provides, that \u201c all contracts, bargains, and conveyances, made by any person under guardianship, shall be utterly void.\u201d\nOne of the questions raised by the motion for a new trial is, whether a married woman can be legally placed under guardianship for the cause stated in the decree of the Municipal Court, viz., that for want of discretion in managing her estate she is likely to become chargeable, \u2014 the charge of the court being, that, under this act, it might be legally done. The defendant claims that it cannot be. The terms of the statute are broad enough to include every person, wlio, having the legal power of managing 1ns or her own estate, is, for-want of discretion in that manage ment, likely to come to want, and.be chargeable as a pauper. It is said, however, that the case of a married woman is impliedly excepted out of the act: and the argument is, that it is inconsistent with the theory of the law, \u2014 that being, that the wife is sub potestate viri; and that it is not competent for the husband to delegate the custody of her person, or the disposition of her property. It is said, also, that in chancery a guardian will not. be appointed over an infant under coverture; that the right of the guardian appointed before marriage is affected by the right which accrues to the husband upon the marriage, and that, for this reason, the testamentary guardianship determines upon the marriage of the ward. In the cases cited, Mendes v. Mendes, 1 Ves. Sen. 91, as to testamentary guardians, and in Roach v. Garvan, 1 Ves. Sen. 160, that guardianship of an infant must cease at the marriage, as well as in the passage in Eeeves, on the Domestic Eolations, p. 328, the reasons given why such guardianship should not continue are, that, upon th\u00e9 marriage, the husband succeeds to the rightful control of all the property of the ward,\u2014 to the right- of disposition of the personal estate, and to the possession and pernancy of the profits of the real estate, so that there is nothing for a guardian to control. This reasoning clearly does not reach the case of one who has the power of disposing of her income, to the utter exclusion of all control of the husband. Where the control is exclusively in the husband, it could never be true that the wife, for want of discretion in management, could be wasting her estate. It might be, if the sole power of disposition were in her. There is no case which holds, that where it is found to be true, that she is so wasting her estate, a court of equity will not interfere.\nThis power, however inconsistent at first- view it may appear, is not a new power, though it is here vested in a new jurisdiction. It is one which the Court of Chancery in England has exercised when the interest of the married woman required it. It is said that that court, as the delegate of the crown as parens patriae, had originally the right, not only to the custody of infants, but also of idiots and lunatics ; and that the jurisdiction had a rightful foundation in the prerogative of the crown,- \u2014 in its general power and duty to protect those who have no other lawful protection ; and it'is said, also, that in every civilized state such a superintendence and protective power does somewhere exist. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jurisp. \u00a7 1333. This power extends, by construction, to all persons of unsound mind from whatever cause, and includes all who are found, by inquisition, incapable of conducting their own affairs. 3 Bl. Com. 304; 1 Inst. 246. It is equally the duty of the court to appoint committees for those who have become incapable of managing their affairs, as for those who never had the capacity to do it; and, in Ex-parte Cranmer, 12 Ves. 445, it is significantly asked by the Chancellor, why should not a man be entitled to protection in his second state of infancy, as well as in the first ? The whole prerogative is, that it falls' to the king to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves; and referring to the phrase used by Lord Cooke, he says, \u201c upon this the jurisdiction (which God forbid should not exist) is clear over those who, from sickness, accident, or old age, have lost their understanding.\u201d In such case, a writ in the nature of a writ de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo will issue, to enquire if the person is fit for the government of himself and his own affairs j and if the return be that he is not, and is of unsound mind, a committee will be appointed. Though from the very nature of the subject, cases would seldom arise requiring the exercise of this power in regard to married women, yet the power to proceed by commission against a feme covert would seem to be as unquestionable as against a feme sole, or other person. It is recognized^ as an existing power. In Ex-parte Tomlinson, 1 Ves. & Beames, 57, the Chancellor speaks of an application for a commission against a lady unqiiestionably lunatic, which was opposed by the hu'sband. It was refused, not for want of jurisdiction, (that seemed to be admitted,) but because, as he said, he considered that there was nothing which called upon him to interpose. It did not appear to him necessary for her good to interpose. In Brodie v. Barry, 2 Ves. & Beames, 36, this power is again spoken of as an unquestioned power. That was an application by the husband for an allowance to him, out of the separate estate of the wife\", who was non compos, and resident in Scotland; and in this case, the Chancellor says, that were she resident in England instead of Scotland, a commission might have issued; and the consideration would then be, whether, regarding the means of the husband and the extent of the separate estate, an allowance would be proper. In re Hewson, 13 E. L. & Eq. 197, Mrs. Hewson, who was found lunatic in 1845, had a separate estate. The committee claimed against the husband\u2019s executor, moneys received by him out of her separate estate.\nIt is this power over idiots, lunatics, persons non compos mentis, or who, for want of discretion, were incapable of managing their estate, which the legislature proposed to vest in the town councils, (now constituting the courts of probate in the several towns.) There was, at the time the act was passed, no court of chancery to exercise this power, \u2014 a power, it is said, of such absolute necessity, that it would seem strange if, in any civilized community, it did not somewhere exist.\nIn 1742, the General Assembly, for the first time, legislated upon the subject of the apjiointment of guardians over the persons or estates of persons other than infants; and provided for all the cases to which the jurisdiction of the chancery in England had been extended, or which seemed to require a remedy. The title of the act indicates its general purpose, \u2014 \u201c An act empowering the several town councils of this colony to have the care and oversight of all persons who are delirious, distracted, or non compos mentis, and their estates.\u201d It enacts, that \u201c it shall be in the power of each town council in this government, to take into their care all persons and their estates, in each respective town, who are delirious, distracted, or non compos mentis, or such who, for want of discretion in managing their estates, are likely to bring themselves and families to want and misery, and thereby render themselves and their families chargeable to the respective towns in which such persons live ; and the said town councils are hereby fully empowered to appoint one or more proper person or persons as guardians to such person or persons who now are, or hereafter shall happen to be, delirious, distracted, or non compos mentis, or otherwise discomposed as aforesaid, to have the ordering of such person or persons and families, and to improve the rents and profits of their estates, to and for the support of such disordered persons as aforesaid and their families; and also to act and transact their secular affairs ; and to sue and be sued in the behalf and name of all such person or persons, in as full and ample- order as they themselves could, if compos mentis.\u201d It will be seen that this act did, in the most ample manner, vest in the town councils, and now does in the several courts of probate, this jurisdiction over all persons who are of unsound mind, and incompetent to manage their estates, exercised by the court of chancery in England, either by its own inherent power, or by delegation of the prerogatives of the crown as parens patrien, to protect those who have no other protector.. It is given them for the same purpose, \u2014 that the estates of such as have not the capacity to manage them should be managed, improved, taken care of, and applied for their benefit, \u2014 the comfortable support of themselves, and of their families if they have any. \u2022 The act suggests another motive, viz., to save the towns from the burthen of supporting-such persons after their estate shall be wasted away. To carry out the purposes for which this power is vested in chancery, and the purposes expressed in, and implied from, this act, it is as necessary that a married woman should be the subject of this jurisdiction, as any other person who is incompetent to manage his or her estate. If this protective power be not exercised, of what avail would it be that property is secured to her sole and separate use, while she has not sufficient discretion to apply it to that use ?\nIt is no objection, as suggested, to the exercise of this power by the court of probate, that this court may appoint a trustee of her property. Such an appointment would not prevent her wasting it so long as she had the power to direct the action of the trustee, and to bind her estate in his hands, independently of his will. The trust is created to exclude all power or control of the husband over her estate, but not to restrain her power of disposition. The trust, in such case, answers the purpose for which. it was designed, but not the purposes of this act.\nNeither is it an objection, as is suggested, to the validity of the decree appointing the guardian in this case, that the complaint and application made to the court did not allege that the husband was unable to support his wife. It must be proved, undoubtedly, in every case, to the satisfaction of the court, that she is likely to become chargeable, and that, for want of discretion to manage her-estate; and it may be matter for the consid eration of the court, that the husband\u2019s means are ample and beyond contingency, \u2014 showing that there is no reasonable danger that she will not always be provided for; but it is no picture of the imagination to suppose a husband without such means, nay, himself dependent upon her income for his own support. We must assume that the Municipal Court had proof sufficient to satisfy them, that, for want of discretion in managing her estate, Mrs. Olney\u2019s estate was being wasted away, and if totally wasted, there would be nothing to prevent her becoming chargeable. They have so adjudged, and if they had jurisdiction, that judgment is conclusive.\nNeither do we think that it is any sufficient objection to the decree, that the guardianship of the property is coupled with the guardianship of the person. It is not necessary, in the exercise of any of the guardian\u2019s powers, to invade any of the rights of the husband, either in the disposition and control of the property of the wife, or the custody of her person. Whatever control of her person may be necessary for her protection and for the assertion of her just rights must necessarily be given to the guardian, but this may be, and would be, in subordination to every just right of the husband. The custody of her person would not be taken from him unless for' her protection. In the case before us, all idea of an invasion of the husband\u2019s right is excluded by the fact, that this proceeding was had upon his application.\nUpon the whole, we see no sufficient objection to the validity of the decree of the Municipal Court, appointing a guardian over the person and estate of Mrs. Olney; and must hold, that from the time of the appointment, and while she- continued under guardianship, she was incapable of performing any legal act in regard to this promissory note, and that the attempted transfer of the note to the defendant by 'her was absolutely void, and passed no interest, to him. This being so, without considering another point made by the defendant, we must overrule the motion for a new trial, and render judgment upon the verdict, for the plaintiff. ,"},{"case_name":"Kneedler versus Lane et al.; Smith versus Lane et al.; Nichols versus Lehman et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/229168\/","date":"1864-01-16","court":"Supreme Court of Pennsylvania","content":"The opinion of the court was delivered\nby Strong, J.\nWhen the motions for preliminary injunctions were made in these cases, and all the' judges of the Supreme Court were invited to hear the argument, and advise what orders should be made, I was of opinion that there was no equity in the complainants\u2019 bills, and I advised that the injunctions asked for should be denied. I thought then, as I think now, that the act of Congress of March 3d, 1863, under which the defendants were acting, is constitutional, and therefore that they had neither done nor proposed to do anything contrary to law or injurious to the complainants. The reasons upon which my opinion was founded I then reduced to writing', and they are on file in this court. They are not all which I might have given.5 Upon the power of a State court to enjoin a \/ Federal officer against the performance of a duty imposed upon him by an act of Congress, I refrained from expressing any opinion. I refrain now. Yet I had no doubt then,, and I have none now, that these bills do not present a proper case for the interference of a court of equity, by injunction, even if ths_act of__Oongress were unconstitutional.^ The facts charged exhibit no case for the action of a court of equity. No chancellor ever enjoined in such a case, and I think it has never before been supposed that he has any jurisdiction over such a wrong (if it be a wrong) as these complainants ask to be restrained. During the whole of the two arguments to which I have listened, one in support of the original motions, and the other against the present motions to dissolve the injunctions, I have heard no reference to an authority for the position that a court of equity has \u00abany right to interfere in such a case. I believe no authority of the kind can be found. Reference has, indeed, been made to our act of assembly of June 16, 1836, which confers upon this court and the several courts of Common Pleas power to \u201c prevent or restrain the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law, and prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals;\u201d but until now it has never been supposed that this act extends the preventive power of this court beyond that possessed by any English chancellor. No one has ventured to assert that every civil wrong may be restrained by injunction, and that a judge sitting in equity can enjoin against any act that a common law court and jury can redress. It was jurisdiction and power in equity that the legislature intended to bestow upon our courts; and it has never been seriously claimed that they bestowed more than is possessed and exercised by courts of equity in England and in other States. But when, before these cases, was an 5 injunction ever granted to restrain the commission of a merely \\ personal tort? What chancellor ever asserted he had such \\power?) It was hinted in the argument that the power must M be Vested in this court, because the privilege of the writ of >! habeas corpus has been suspended in certain cases. The hint will not bear examination. How can the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, either by Congress or any branch of the Federal government, enlarge the jurisdiction of this court? Or how can the restoration of this privilege curtail its jurisdiction ? The extent of the powers of every court in this State is defined by State law. It is not in the power of Congress to enlarge it, either by direct or indirect action. Besides, if the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus could confer upon a State court a power to enjoin against an arrest (a power which, without the suspension, it would not possess), then the Constitution of the United States, in authorizing it in cases of rebellion or invasion, _when, the public safety may require it\u00a1 has merely converted a habeas corpus into an injunction, and substituted a bill of equity for a common law writ. Then the object sought to be accomplished by the constitutional provision has utterly failed. Manifestly, the Constitution contemplates' the possible necessity of arrests without the interference of courts in times of rebellion or invasion, and it has provided for such cases by authorizing a denial of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. But what does this amount to, if the very act of taking away the writ enlarges the power of State courts of equity, and justifies them in interfering to prohibit the arrests. I will not, however, pursue this subject further; I mention it at all only because I would not have it thought that I admit the power of this court to interfere by injunction, even if the defendants proposed wrongfully to force the complainants into the military service of the United States.\nWhen the injunctions were ordered in these cases I endeavored to show that the act of Congress of March 3d, 1863, is constitutional; that consequently -the bills exhibit no wrong done, or threatened to be done, to the complainants, and that for this reason they have no equity. I have heard nothing since which has raised even a doubt of the correctness of the opinion I then gave. Very much might be added to what I said in vindication of the constitutional power of Congress to enact the law, and in refutation of the objections urged against it; but I should hardly be justified in entering again upon a discussion of that subject before these eases came up for final decrees.\n. It was strenuously insisted at the argument that the present motions should not be entertained, because the defendants have neither demurred to the bill, nor -put in an answer, nor pre'sented affidavits denying the facts averred, and because the cases stand now as they did when the orders for the injunctions were made. It is said that a\u201epreliminary injunction will not be dissolved until an answer has been put in, or at least until affidavits on the part of the defendants have been filed. In answer to this it may be said that whatever may be the extent of the rule thus invoked iq opposition to these motions, it is still but a rule of practice existing for the relief of the court, and not for the protection of complainants. An interlocutory injunction is entirely at the discretion of the court. It is not a thing of right. Complainants cannot demand it. 'It is always granted or dissolved according to the will of the chancellor, and if at any stage of the cause he sees fit to dissolve it, no right of the complainants is taken away. I admit the general rule to be that when an application to dissolve an injunction is made before answer, it must be supported by affidavits on the part of the defendant in answer to those upon which the injunction was obtained. Decisions to this effect may be found in any number. But the rule is applicable only to cases where the facts averred in the bill and special affidavits of the complainants are disputed. It has no relation to cases where the defect is in the complainant\u2019s equity, not in the evidence of his facts. More frequently a motion to dissolve an injunction is based upon a denial of the facts charged in the bill, but a defendant may move to dissolve it on the sole ground of want of equity in the bill. Minturn v. Seymour, 4 Johns. Cha. 173 ; Canal Co. v. Railroad Co., 4 Grill & Johnson, 7. When the motion is made for such a reason it need not be supported by affidavits, and a bill requiring such support would be absurd.\nThe facts all appear in the bill of the complainant. They are not controverted. Nothing is in issue but the equity arising out of conceded facts, and affidavits either asserting or denying that would be a novelty indeed. Neither courts of law or courts of equity, in any case, require the law or the equity to be made to appear by affidavits. The decisions- cited in support of the rule of practice referred to have no relation to such cases-as the present, which are motions to dissolve injunctions for want of equity in the bill. They could not have been cited unless the distinction between the facts which raise an equity and the equity itself had been overlooked.\nThus, in the case first above cited, Chancellor Kent allowed a motion to be made to dissolve an injunction granted by himself for the want of equity in the bill, though the defendant had not answered. Nor does it appear that he had submitted any affidavits. And in the Canal Co. v. Railroad Co., above cited, it was said by Chancellor Bland, in reference to a motion to dissolve an injunction, that \u201c if it should appear the facts as stated in the bill, looking to the bill alone,, gave rise to no equity, it is very certain that the injunction would be dissolved whether the defendants had answered or not, or however imperfectly they might have answered.\u201d The contest in these cases relates solely to the question whether the complainants have any equity on their own showing. Clearly they have not, if the act of Congress is constitutional. Now, it is not denied that, if the defendants, before these motions were made, had put in answers admitting all the facts charged in the bills, as they might have done, it would be the duty of the court' to dissolve the injunctions, if the facts raise no equity in favor of the complainants, and that such a course would be perfectly regular. In what particular would the conscience of the court be better informed had such answers been put in, than it is now? At most, then, the objection urged with so much vehemence to entertaining the present motions, the objections that the cases stand now as they did when the injunctions were granted, is but the minutest technicality, and interposed not in furtherance of justice, but to defeat jt. In truth, however, it does not rise even to the dignity of a technicality, for the present motions are founded, not upon a denial of anything that could be verified by affidavit, but upon a want of equity in the bills, and to such motions the rule requiring answers contr\u00f3verting the facts alleged by the complainants is totally inapplicable.\n_And were it not so, if the rule is for the protection of the court, and not of the complainants, as no one doubts, and if the dissolution of the preliminary injunctions, equally with the grant of them, lies wholly in the sound discretion of the court, as all the books agree, there are abundant reasons in these cases why the motions to dissolve should be entertained, and why the orders heretofore made should be set aside.\nThe orders were made at Nisi Prius, and they are, in fact, but,the orders of a single judge, though he undoubtedly took the opinions of all his brethren. Still, the. orders were his, and his. alone. They could be nothing more. Our act of assembly of July 26, 1842 (P. L. 433, sec. 9), turns all cases in equity, brought in the Supreme Court, over to the judge at Nisi Prius, and they come into the Supreme Court in banc only after final decree. And it was at Nisi Prius that these motions were made. The judge before whom they were made has called in the other judges, not to decide but -to advise what disposition shall be made of them. This he has done from respect to them and because they advised when, the injunctions were ordered. It is not easy to see that any other course would have been decorous. The motions are, therefore, pending. Nothing can be gained or secured by a continuance of the injunctions. The bills on their face-show that the complainants must have gone into the military service of the United States, and beyond any possible interference of the defendants, or that they had commuted, or had been exempted, before the injunctions were ordered, and even before the motions for injunctions had been argued.\nThe orders of the judge at Nisi Prius can, therefore, have no possible beneficial effect upon the condition of the complainants, while if they remain, made as they were in accordance with the advice of a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, and upon the ground that the act of Congress is unconstitutional, they hold out to every drafted man a temptation to resist all attempts to coerce him into military service. Unnecessarily to continue such a temptation is cruelty, if a majority of the Supreme Court now believe the act of Congress to be constitutional, and that, consequently, forcible resistence to it would be a crime.\nAgain, the orders for the injunctions were made ex parte, after argument on behalf of the complainants alone. No one attended for the defendants. It is true there was an appearance on record for the defendants in one of the cases, and notice of the motion was served on the solicitor, who appeared in that case. But there was no appearance in the other two eases, and there was no proof of notice of the motions to all the defendants. They are not the same in the several cases. If there was laches in responding to the notice of the motion in one case, there is no proof of any laches in the other two. And, in fact, the injunctions were ordered against official action of government officers. To the government laches is not to be imputed.\nNor ought it to be overlooked that the orders for the injunctions were in their character extraordinary and unprecedented. When before was an act of Congress ever declared unconstitutional by a State court in deciding upon a motion for an interlocutory order ? A just respect for the government under which we live demands that if there was a mistake in such a case, the court should seize with avidity the earliest opportunity to rectify it instead of persisting in the error under cover of a rule adopted only to secure its own convenience. I may add that in other cases there has been no hesitation in listening to applications for the correction of mistakes into which even the Supreme Court in banc has been supposed to have fallen. This very week a motion was entertained in the Supreme Court to change a final judgment given at Pittsburg in October term last. It was supported by no affidavit, nor had there been any change of the record, or any new pleadings. Yet not a judge hesitated to entertain the motion, or to hear an argument in its support and another against it. If such motions are allowed in reference to final judgments, how can it consistently be said that a motion to dissolve injunctions ordered on interlocutory motion, based- on the reason that the bill exhibits no equity, may not be entertained, unless accompanied by affidavits denying, not the facts, but the equity ?\nOnce more. The records show that the injunctions ordered in these cases have never been issued. They would have been fruitless if they had been. The complainants have filed no bonds, nor have they ta*ken out any injunctions. They have rested satisfied with the orders. The matter, therefore, remains perfectly within the jurisdiction of the court, even if the dissolution of an injunction itself was not'discretionary. These are quite sufficient reasons, in my judgment, for entertaining the present motions, even if the rule of practice, on which the complainants rely, applies to such oases as these. And manifestly it does not. There is nothing in the way of deciding these motions on their merits. And as I am satisfied that the bills of complainants have no equity, and that the act of Congress is such as Congress has the constitutional power to enact, I think the orders for preliminary injunctions made in all these eases should be rescinded, and that the motions for the injunctions should he overruled.\n\u25a0 Such being the opinion of a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, the orders are directed to be vacated, and the motions for injunctions are overruled."},{"case_name":"George Bowman, plaintiff and respondent, vs. William M. Tallman, defendant and appellant","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1425661\/","date":"1864-06-30","court":"New York Superior Court","content":"McCunn, J.\nThis is an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant to recover the sum of $1341.18, for professional services rendered as an attorney and counsellor at law. The complaint is in the usual form, setting forth that by reason of certain retainers, on the part of the defendant, he, the plaintiff, performed certain professional services, as an attorney and counsellor at law, and that he is justly entitled to recover a fair compensation therefor. The answer does not deny the rendering of the services, nor the value thereof, but sets up as a defense a want of retainer of the plaintiff on the part of the defendant, and avers that the alleged services were performed for other parties, and when so performed were entirely worthless ; and charges the plaintiff with? a want of knowledge of his professional duties, and alleges that owing to such want of knowledge and neglect on his part, he is not entitled to recover.\nOn a careful examination of the case, I think there are but two questions for the court to consider :\n1. Was there such a retainer, or an agreement,- on the part of the defendant as would entitle the plaintiff to recover in this form of action ? And 2. Is the charge of professional ingnorance sufficient to preclude such a recovery as claimed ?\nIt is a well established elementary principle of law, that the party employing an attorney or counsel to perform any service in his professional capacity, in the absence of a special agreement to the contrary, is personally responsible for any such services rendered. (Wilson v. Burr, 25 Wend. 386. 2 Shaw, 421, marginal reference. 2 Chitty\u2019s Plead. 69, and note D. Hill v. Tucker, 1 Taunt. 7 and 5 id. 46.)\nThe general rule is, that the party employed looks to the employer for payment; and where a trustee employs an agent, in the execution of his trust, such agent must look to the person employing him, individually, for his payment, and can have no claim on the trust funds. (Noyes v. Blakeman, 2 Seld. 580.)\n\u25a0 Whether Tallman had, or had not, in his case, authority to make an agreement with the plaintiff, is immaterial; that was a question between Tallman and the heirs., and could not, in the slightest degree, affect the plaintiff's claim. Moreover, the parties for whom the defendant was acting, were minors, and non-residents of the state.\nThe defendant was the general agent of the property, and acted for all the heirs. That the defendant had previously been a client of the plaintiff, and employed the plaintiff to do business for the infants, and non-residents, who were irresponsible parties, without suggesting or agreeing that he should become individually responsible for the same, \u00f3r without notifying the plaintiff he would not be responsible, and this, taken together with the fact that the defendant controlled the entire .business funds and all the other concerns gf the estate, warrants me in concluding that the defendant is clearly responsible.\nI find, on examining the case, that the defendant himself even agreed to pay the plaintiff out of the trust funds, when he obtained the same, and in this there is a good and valid promise when there was a strong moral obligation to pay before.\nThe theory, that a promise, though the party making the same may not be legally bound, can be supported by a moral obligation, is not a modern principle of law. It has long been established that where a person is morally and conscientiously bound to pay a debt, though not legally bound, a subsequent promise will give a right of action, (Lee v. Muggeridge, 5 Taunt. 46.)\nI am clearly of opinion that the learned justice who tried the case, would have been justified in taking the .question of employment or. retainer entirely from the jury, and directing a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.\nHe, however, left the question to the jury as to whether Mr. Tallman employed the plaintiff individually or not, and whether \u2019 he agreed to pay for such services ; and inasmuch as the jury found only such a verdict as the court should have directed, the defendant has sustained no injury by the ruling of the court. There was no conflict of testimony as to the fact that the defendant personally employed the plaintiff without any lawful authority to fyind any one but himself, and there being no dispute about the rendering of the services, or the value of the same, this disposes of the first proposition.\nThe remaining question to he disposed of is, \u201c whether the plaintiff was right in advising the proceedings first undertaken, to sell the property, under the statute, or if not right in that respect, whether he was so far wrong in such advice as to preclude him from recovering in this case.\n\u201c It has been suggested that however clear the power of a court of general equity jurisdiction would be under the circumstances disclosed in this case, to sell the property in question, yet the proceedings, which were resorted to, were not in an action, were solely authorized by statute, and that such statutory provisions must be strictly followed, or the sale will be void.\"\nAs to this I concur; moreover, I hold that the authority must be found in the statute, but I think the statutory provisions as applied to the case are clear and ample.\nIt is conceded by all that the statute was intended to furnish a cheap and prompt mode of selling infants\u2019 estates where such sale is necessary. If the statute did not apply, it failed of its object, in a case, calling most pressingly _for its action.\nBut the statute did not fail. The statute expressly provides for selling interests of all infants who were seised. All the infants who were seised applied for the sale, and I think the courf, to whom the application was made, was bound to sell without hesitating upon the objection, that if they did not sell, other 'interests might hereafter spring into existence. This was an additional reason for prompt action, in order that a just, necessary and beneficial sale might not be delayed or prevented.-\nThe infants before the court (in connection with owners of life estates) held and owned for the time being the whole estate, and that was sufficient under the statute to authorize the sale. The interests of the infants involved in this case were not extraordinary or uncommon.\nThe will under which the estate was devised contained no extraordinary provision, and none, whatever, which was violated in the sale. Such cases seem to have been expressly contemplated by the legislature, when they provided for the preserva tion of the proceeds of the sale as \u201c real estate \u201d to which the interests of unborn children will attach, and not to the real estate sold. Public policy forbids any other course in such a case. Supposing the theory to be correct that this property could not be sold for the purpose of paying this assessment, the entire estate would have been in jeopardy, perhaps lost to all the parties concerned. Moreover, the necessity of such a sale in this case has not been disputed.\nIt has not been argued, nor does it appear that there is any substantial difference between an application for sale under the statute and a partition sale, and the court in the case of Mead v. Mitchell, (17 N. Y. Rep. 216,) expressed the opinion that a sale in partition binds after born children, on principles of equity independent of the statute. (Cheesman v. Thorne, 1 Edw. C. R. 630. Wills v. Slade, 6 Vesey, 498. Baker v. Lorrillard, 4 Comst. 257.)\nIf the interests of children in existence attach to the fund in court as real estate, most certainly can the vague interest of' unborn children attach to the fund in court as real estate.\nI hold, that a sale of the estate under the statute would have been a sale of the whole interest, entirely freed from the danger of any interest thereafter, and which would follow the estate where it lawfully had gone, that is to the fund in court, as real estate to be preserved for just such contingencies. (7 Paige, 185.) It would be absurd to think that a property of this kind could be liable to extinguishment by this assessment, when we have the parties in court who held the whole estate, and could not dispose of any portion of the property for the purpose of preserving the rights of all interested.\nIf the contrary was the rule, how long then must this estate continue to be inalienable ? Infants unborn are not seised; hence courts cannot sell their interests, because such interests do not exist; they can sell only interests existing. If a child should be born, it will be vested with the interest in the share substituted for real estate and held by its co-heirs. The whole interest must exist somewhere, and this being the rule, it is of course subjected to legal control, and the reason why the inter est of an unborn child cannot be sold, or why it cannot have a guardian appointed, is because there is no such interest in existence.\nI repeat, however, that if such unborn infant have such an interest as an infant in existence, not only are they identical, but they demand the interposition of the court, especially in such a case as this, where, without such interposition, the interests of all must perish.\nThe counsel objecting to the title on'the sale of the property under the statute, show no reasonable grounds for such objections, and the law deems every one satisfied, when he shows no such reasonable grounds. (Baker v. Jones, 2 Car. & P. 743. Perkins v. Wash. Ins. Co., 4 Cowen, 645.)\nThe opinion of the learned judge at Supreme Court, special term, touching some of the points in the case, does not in the slightest degree impair my belief, that the court of last resort would have compelled the purchasers to receive the property under the order of sale, made by the court; nor does it shake my opinion; that a sale under such an order was proper, and sustained by law, and I think the Supreme Court, at general term, must have considered the interests involved of but little importance, from the fact that I find the questions were passed upon by the learned judges of that bench without a single expression of opinion from any of them.\nNotwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court, I am still fully of opinion that the advice given by the plaintiff to the defendant was proper, and that the learned justice who tried the case below was justified in holding that the plaintiff was right in the course which he pursued, or at least that he was not so far wrong that he should be deprived of a fair compensation for his services.\nThe judgment below should be affirmed with costs.\nBarbour, J. concurred,\nwwo\nRobertson, Ch. J. The answer in this case sets forth at length the proceedings taken by the plaintiff for the sale of certain real estate devised by the father of the defendant, the decisions of the Supreme Court against the sufficiency of one, the abandonment of another, and the success of a third. It also makes a separate submission of certain questions apparently as matters of law, one of which is, that \u201cthe plaintiff is not entitled to recover for services in the nugatory and useless proceedings set forth in the complaint,\u201d which are the same as those set forth in the answer. It does not contain any allegation that the worthlessness of such proceedings was caused by any incompetence, ignorance or neglect on the plaintiff\u2019s part, or that he might, with due diligence, have ascertained that the advice given by him on which such proceedings were taken was erroneous, or that the contrary advice would have been free from any reasonable doubt by any prudent and skillful member of his p'rofession. The main defense on the trial was, as alleged on the motion for a dismissal of the complaint, pursuing the theory of the answer that the services of the plaintiff were \u201cworthless,\u201d and in the requests to charge the jury \u201c worthless to accomplish the purpose intended to be effected by them.\u201d What such purpose was, was not stated.\nThe point of law intended to be thus presented by the answer, motion to dismiss the complaint, and request to charge, was simply that because the statutory proceeding taken by the plaintiff was in law ineffectual to accomplish the purpose for which he was alleged to have been retained to take them, or were made so by the decisions of the Supreme Court, at special and general terms, in such proceeding the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. The principle of professional incompetency and negligence carried to that length I think cannot be sustained. There is no implied agreement in the relation of counsel and client, or in the employment of the former by the latter, that the former will guaranty the success of his proceedings in a suit, or the soundness of his opinions, or that they will be ultimately sustained by a court of last resort. (Lanphier v. Phipos, 8 Car. & P. 475.) He only undertakes to avoid errors which no member of his profession of ordinary prudence, diligence and skill would commit. (Moutrion v. Jeffreys, Ry. & Moo. 317. S. C. 2 Car. & P. 113.) It is not enough that doubts may be raised of the soundness of his opinion or correctness of his course, unless they are accompanied by the absence of all reasonable doubts of the propriety of an opposite course or opinion in the mind of every member of his profession of ordinary skill, sagacity and prudence, caused by a decisiveness of reason and authority in its favor. (Kemp v. Bent, 4 Barn. & Ad. 424.) The practice of the law, in reference to the right of compensation for professional exertions, although dependent on the exercise of intellect and study, as its instruments, is subject to the same rules as any other employment, even where the implements are of a more material kind, and not to any of either greater or less stringency. On the one hand, practitioners are bound to possess the skill and exercise the diligence and attention common to prudent members of their profession; and, on the other, they are released from all liability for consequences, which, considering the fallibility of human reason, must necessarily be sometimes unforseen. They are only chargeable with utter incompetence or want of ordinary care in aparticular case. Therefore, when after using proper diligence, no member of the profession, of ordinary skill and capacity, could entertain a reasonable doubt of the propriety of a contrary view and conduct, if the facts are undisputed, the court can determine, as matter of law, whether, in view of authorities attainable by proper research, any doubt in regard to the law is reasonable. These views are rather sustained than opposed by cases in which attorneys have been denied compensation for services even in an action or proceeding properly begun, but rendered worthless by the mode of conducting them. (Moutrion v. Jeffreys, ubi sup. Hill v. Featherstonhaugh, 7 Bing. 769. Duncan v. Blundell, 3 Stark. 6. Hopping v. Quin, 12 Wend. 517.)\nThe learned judge before whom the action was tried instructed the jury that the correctness of the course of the plaintiff was a question of law, and informed them that he had already in the course of the trial held that the plaintiff was not so far wrong as not to be entitled to compensation for the services performed, to which an exception was taken. He also refused to charge, as requested, that the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings were worthless to accomplish the desired purpose, whatever it was, or that the decision of the Supreme Court must be taken as establishing such worthlessness. In such instructions and charge, I think he was correct, both because it is not such mere worthlessness which as a fact is exclusively of services alone, but the ignorance, incompetence, and inattention on which it is founded, which should deprive a party, employed to render them, of all compensation, and because there was no direct allegation in the answer of such worthlessness as a fact, but only an argumentative one, founded on the failure and abandonment of the proceedings and the adverse decision of the Supreme Court, both of which fail, - in my view, to establish it as matter of law, which could deprive the plaintiff of compensation.\nI have not the slightest doubt of the correctness of such decisions of the Supreme Court, if they are necessarily open for examination in this case. The clear language and sole purpose of the statute, fortified by the two decisions of Baker v. Lorillard (4 Comst. 257,) and Forman v. Marsh (11 N. Y. Rep. 548,) seem to me to set the question at rest. In the former case, J ustice Bronson, in delivering his opinion, expresses certain views consisting of three propositions, in which he says the majority of the court concur; although upon the second one, which was that the contingent interests of certain unborn infants were not bound by a sale under the statute in question, (2 R. S. 194,) he states that some did not \u201c choose to express opinion but nothing is said indicating that even upon that point a majority did not concur. Justice Harris, in the same case, adverting to the fact that the first taker took a vested estate which would open to let in after born children, suggested the idea, which, on examination, will be found to be unsupported, that the first taker thereby beeame a trustee for those in remainder, and reied upon the 180th section of the statute, (2 R. S. 195,) as seeming to look \u201c to a state of things where the whole title might be vested in the infant, and yet some other person might have some contingent or beneficial interest in it.\u201d He certainly did not mean to assume that without the statute the first takers had such a legal estate as trustees, that they could sell and bind the contingent remainders ; nor that the law invested those who were not competent to take care of their own interests, and were incapacitated to sell their own estate, by mere force of coming into court to seek its protection and aid in order to procure a sale'of their own interests and property to supply their own wants, or promote their own interests, with the guardianship of the contingent interests of others, which could only take effect by taking away part of their estate, and whose interests and necessities might be diametrically opposed to theirs. Such a doctrine would\" break down all the well settled distinctions between legal limitations and equitable interests. He was evidently misled by a hasty or incorrect view of the 180th section. The object of that section was held by Justice Edwards, in delivering the opinion of the court in Forman v. Marsh, (ubi sup.) to be \u201c to deprive the (special) guardian of power, either to affect the rights of representatives of infants, or give them a power of testamentary disposition not before possessed,\u201d he declaring in the most emphatic manner \u201c that such were the only reasons which had been or could be suggested for its introduction.\u201d It is true that Justice Buggies in the last case, overlooking the peculiar force of the exceptive particle \u201c but,\u201d as used in such section, considered it as divided into two branches, of which he considered only the second to be intended to preserve the character of real estate for the land, and the first as \u201c intended to protect the interests of those who might have future estates vested or contingent interests in the land.\u201d Against whom or what, it is to be regretted that he omitted to state. The 180th section was an amendment passed in 1815, (Laws of 1815, p. 104, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6,) of the original act passed in 1814, (Laws of 1814, p. 116, ch. 108,) at the same session with the special act which originally suggested the propriety and necessityof its passage. (Clarke v. Van Surlay, 15 Wend. 443.) If the original act did not authorize a sale which would' defeat future contingent interests, there was no necessity for introducing any restriction in such amendment; and certainly the latter, whatever it might look to, did not purport to confer any new authority. The legislature could hardly he chargeable with the absurdity of imposing a restriction on the right of testamentary disposition of the property by the infant petitioners, and at'the same time giving them power to dispose of the interests of others in one and the same section. The exceptive particle \u201c but,\u201d makes the whole section read as merely depriving the infant applicants of any \u201c greater estate or interest in the proceeds \u201d than \u201c one of the same nature with that which they had in the property \u201d sold.\nA very cursory examination of the statute itself will suffice to show that there is not another expression in it which looks to the sale of any other interest hut that of the petitioning infants, who are the only applicants and parties to the proceedings. Its first section (\u00a7 170) defines the persons who are' to apply as infants seised of real estate; the object to be attained is a sale or other disposition of their property, the mode of application by petition, by a next friend or guardian* implying living persons, and the kind of disposition is submitted to the discretion of the court. The person whom the court appoints to make such disposition is made special guardian not of the proceedings, but such infants, (that is, the petitioners,) to whom he is to give a bond for the performance of his duties. (\u00a7\u00a7 171 to 174, inclusive.) A reference, which is then ordered, is a summary inquiry, not into the propriety of a sale, but \u201cmerits of the application.\u201d (Id.) The considerations by which the court is to be governed in directing any disposition of the estate are-there prescribed. (\u00a7175.) Those are either the necessities of the infant petitioners in reference to their support and education, or else their interests in reference either to the exposure of the premises in question to waste and dilapidation, or their unproductiveness, or other \u201cpeculiar\u201d reasons or circumstances, (\u00a7 175,) and the court is not authorized to sanction any disposition, except such as is required to-meet the exact Case. A mortgage or a- lease is authorized equally with a sale, if answering the desired purpose. In such a case, the court clearly is not to act as a court cutting off contingent remainder men, as by a fine and recovery, which may not be necessary, and clearly would be improper, in order to benefit the first takers, (Cochran v. Van Surlay, 20 Wend. 375, per Walworth, Ch.) but as the representative of the legislature as parens patriae, (Id. p. 373,) as in the precisely analogous proceedings, where infants or others non sui juris hold estates in joint tenancy or in common, (2 R. 8. 330, \u00a7\u00a7 86 to 91,) except that their exposure to the expense of a partition suit is made a sufficient necessity. The court is not authorized to inquire into or required to protect the interests of contingent remainder men in the disposition it may make. After the disposition ordered is made by the guardian, the infant applicants alone are m\u00e1de expressly wards of the court. Any surplus to be invested is to be for their benefit alone. (\u00a7\u00a7 178, 179.) And, finally, no greater effect is given to the conveyance by the special guardian than to one executed by the petitioning infants.when they had attained their majority. Even the prohibition of a disposition of the premises contrary to the provisions of the instrument by which the title was acquired, refers to such acquisition by the infant petitioners alone. The statute Speaks throughout only of the \u201c estate \u201d of the infant applicants and their \u201c property,\u201d and says nothing of land, except in regard to leases or of the title to or fee of it. Even the restriction of the 180th section is only upon infants whose \u201c real estate,\u201d is sold. If the statute gives authority to pass the estates of contingent remainder men, it makes no distinction between the living and the unborn infants and persons of full age. The living contingent remainder man would b.e as much cut off by such a sale as unborn infants. Besides, where are such contingent unborn remainder men to look for protection to their interests ? The special guardian\u2019s bond is not to them ; he is not the protector of their rights ; the first takers are entitled to receive the proceeds of the disposition on coming of age, since the court cannot determine what proportion to keep back, and if the contingent remainder men are not then born, they have nothing afterwards to look to but the responsibility of those who have received such proceeds. Such a proceeding, in case the interests of contingent remainder men are cut off under a sale pursuant to the statute, would, clearly be taking the property of one to benefit another. There is a wide distinction between such a proceeding for the benefit of a living first taker without regard to- other interests, and the representation by the first taker of all future contingent remainders, where their common interest is assailed or required to be protected. (Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. \u00a7\u00a7 144-147, 159.) In partition suits, the rights of copartners, joint tenants, or tenants in common, to sever their interests, is the sole ground of such representation, (Wells v. Slade, 6 Ves. 498,) and a sale is only authorized when a partition is impracticable, and the court may protect the intersts of those represented, by retaining the whole share. The whole question in such proceeding is not one of right, but of expediency. It has none of the characteristics' of such fictitious actions as \u201c fines and recoveries,\u201d invented to unshackle lands from intricate impediments to alienation. Indeed, the plaintiff himself seems to have perceived the distinction just noted, when he speaks in his testimony of \u201c the statutory proceeding not being in the nature of an adverse suit.\u201d\nI have in the preceding considerations assumed what seems to have been heretofore assumed by every one who has had any thing to do with the proceedings set out in the complaint, and as is alleged in the answer, not only that the infant petitioner who had survived her mother had a vested interest in the land, but also the others, whose mothers were living ; but I can find no warrant for it in the eighth clause of the will of the grandfather of such infants (Wm. Tallman, Jr.) which is the only part before us. It contains a reference, to a previous and subsequent \u201c bequest,\" the former to his wife, and the latter to three of his daughters, whose names are not given ; but we are not informed of the nature or terms of either. It first \u201c gives, devises and bequeaths \u201d a residue of personal estate, the premises in question and other lands, subject to the prior bequest to his wife, and the payment of such subsequent one to the three daughters. It then proceeds as follows : \u201c All which bequests aire given to them during their natural lives, in equal portions, share and share alike, and after their decease, to their children, the child or children of each to take the share of their mother; \u201d but concludes by saying: \u201c And in case any of my said daughters should die without lawful issue, then * * the portion devised and bequeathed to such daughter shall be divided between the remainder of my children in equal portions, share and share alike.\u201d I am unable to perceive how such clause creates a remainder in any grandchild, if its mother should leave descendants, but no children surviving her. To effect such a construction, considerable violence must be done to its language, while words of established different significations used in juxtaposition must be presumed to have been employed to mean the same thing. Thus, for such purpose, not only must the word \u201c bequests,\u201d when referring to some gift of the testator in which a remainder to children is created, be so far wrested from its legitimate meaning as to include devises, but, in order to be applied to any devise in the will, the employment of the same word in its ordinary sense immediately precedingly to which its accompanying relative pronoun grammatically refers, must be disregarded and overleaped without the slightest necessity or justification. So, too, as the statutory definition of the phrase \u201c dying without issue \u201d is dying without heirs or descendants of the first taker surviving him, (1 R. S. 724, \u00a7 22,) the remainder over to all the testator\u2019s children could not, therefore, take effect ; if there should be descendants of any of his daughters living at the time of their death, although their children might all be dead; yet the remainder in the \u201c bequests \u201d spoken of was given to children only, and not to issue or descendants. So that if such remainder over were to take effect on the same subject as the first remainder, both provisions would fail, if there were descendants but not children of the first takers living at the time of their death. No different result can be obtained, except by construing \u201cchildren\u201d to mean \u201c issue,\u201d which is plainly forbidden both by the mean ing of the word, the contrast in its use and the insertion of the words \u201ctheir mothers.\u201d\nIf the bequests to the wife and the daughters of the testator, and the remainder to grandchildren, be laid out of view, and the last sentence left to operate as a conditional limitation over on the first devise and bequest only, the meaning is clear. Such devise would create a fee in the four daughters named, (1 R. S. 748, \u00a7 1,) subject to be cut down' to a life estate in case of leaving no descendants, (1 R. S. 724, \u00a7 22,) surviving them, and their interest would then fall back into the testator\u2019s estate, to be redivided by the same clause absolutely among his other children. While the special bequest would remain a legacy to three daughters for life, with remainders to their children, alone opening to let in any afterwards born. The change of the term \u201c share,\u201d if applicable only to an interest in a collateral legacy to three daughters, to \u201c portion,\u201d as applied to the interests given to four in the bulk of the testator\u2019s property, as well as the contrast of the whole language of the gifts of the two remainders, is very significant. This construction seems to me so consistent with rules of grammar, and so natural and obvious, that I am somewhat astonished that in the legal proceedings in regard to such premises it should have been overlooked, if not knowingly disregarded, for other purposes. As the other construction, which was actually applied, only took from the mothers to give to the children, it was, perhaps, not material that it should have been adopted without much inquiry.\nBut, as regards the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services, such construction is material, because a conveyance by the testator\u2019s daughters and the defendant, with one by the special guardian of the infant petitioner, who had survived her mother, and thus inherited the interest devised to her, would carry a complete indefeasible title to the whole estate of the testator in such land. The special proceeding was then of use, and even indispensable. And although the plaintiff may have failed to present the proper views to the Supreme Court, in his argument before it, for any cause whatever, that would only affect his right to compensation for such argument, but not for the steps taken in the proceeding.\nIndependently, however, of the questions of the construction of the statute or will in question, the plaintiff's proceedings would not in any event have proved entirely unprofitable ; the estate of the other infant petitioners, whatever it was, might have been sold as well as that of the petitioner who had survived her mother. Neither the order of the court, nor the contract of the special guardian, is before us. We cannot, therefore, determine whether the latter contracted to convey more than he had authority to dispose of. At all events, a good sale might possibly have been made, and the assessment paid, which was threatening to swallow up tho whole value. The defendant does not appear, even by his own statement to have relied upon any express assurance by the plaintiff that a statutory proceeding would carry the whole title in the land to a purchaser. The court might have thought proper to order only a mortgage to raise enough to pay off the assessment. According to the statements of both parties, cheapness, expedition, and the union of all parties seem to have entered into the resolution to take the proceeding under the statute. The defendant continued to retain the plaintiff to act for him after the refusal by the first purchaser to take, and even after the decision by the Supreme Court, at both special and general terms, and employed him to carry through the final successful action in partition. He was only surprised at the amount of the bill, offered a less amount, and was willing to pay it if he could out of the estate. All this .is hardly consistent with the supposition, that the plaintiffdtad not done what he undertook to do, or had given assurances that were not borne out by the decision of the court, and the abandonment of two sales in succession, op the ground of a defect in the proceeding. There cannot, therefore, well be said to have heen such conclusive evidence of the worthlessness of the proceeding to accomplish every object desired as to require the court to have given the positive instruction asked for on that point. The proceeding may have been an experiment. There is no question before us as to the amount due, if any thing is Rue.\nAnother defense set up in the answer was, that the defendant had no title nor interest in the real estate in question, and in retaining the defendant acted solely as agent of the owners, and so notified the plaintiff, and it was understood that the latter should be compensated for his services out of the pro-' ceeds of the sale of such estate. On the trial, the learned judge before whom the same was tried instructed the jury, in substance, that if they found from the evidence that the defendant \u201cemployed\u201d the plaintiff to render the services for which the action was brought, and agreed to pay him therefor, he was entitled to a verdict for his claim. To which an exception was taken. After the interruption of such exception, the judge proceeded to explain such instruction by a direction to the jury that in determining such question of employment they must believe that the defendant \u201cintended to make himself personally liable,\u201d and that he would not be so liable without an express contract to pay, either if the plaintiff \u201c knew that he was acting for others in a matter in which he had no interest,\u201d or \u201c if he did not intend to make himself personally liable, and the plaintiff so understood it.\u201d No exception was taken to instruction as thus qualified. It is to be presumed the defendant\u2019s counsel was satisfied therewith, as being a compliance with his second request to charge, having taken no exception to the refusal of such request. The only proposition involved ip such a request was, that the defendant was not liable unless he either \u201c made an agreement with the plaintiff (to become personally liable) or intended to make him (the plaintiff) believe, and he did believe and understand, that he (the defendant) would be personally liable.\u201d\nThe instruction as given, with its qualifications, substantially embraced the proposition so requested to be put to the jury ; at all events, it was correct, for undoubtedly an express promise to pay by the defendant would bind him, even although the plaintiff knew him to be acting for others, and that he only intended to bind them \u2022 and if the defendant, with intent to make himself personally liable, the plaintiff understanding such to be his intent, employed the latter, and agreed to pay him for the services to be rendered, he is clearly liable. \u201c Employment,\u201d (Monell v. Marshall, 25 How. 425,) and \u201c retainer,\u201d seem to imply a personal obligation. (Hill v. Tucker, 1 Taunt. 9, per Mansfield, Ch. J. Wilson v. Barr, 25 Wend. 386.) If the defendant was acting as a trustee and not as an agent, he was responsible in the first place, at all events, as principal. (Noyes v. Blakeman, 2 Seld. 580.) Indeed, in regard to attorneys, the presumption as to the person to whom the credit is held to be given seems to be reversed. (2 Chit. Pl. 69, n. d. 2 Show. R. 422. Wilson v. Burr, ubi sup. Hill v. Tucker, ubi sup.) Under the charge, the jury must be presumed to have found either that there was an express contract made by the defendant to pay, or an agreement by him to pay, intending to make himself personally liable, and giving the plaintiff to understand he so intended. And the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony alluded to in the charge was sufficient to sustain it.\nNo question of fact was raised in this case by proof by experts of the views which members of the plaintiff\u2019s profession would entertain of the correctness of his opinion, if given, that the statute gave the court jurisdiction to order a sale of the contingent interests of others not applicants under it, as well as those of such applicants, or, in other words, bind them by the disposition made.\nNot being able to find, therefore, any errors in the charge of the learned judge, or his refusals to charge, which seems to be the principal subject of exception, or the reception or rejection of evidence, I concur in affirming the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed."},{"case_name":"Emily Martin and others vs. Andrew Martin, executoi &c., impleaded with Lynch, executor","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/5125005\/","date":"1864-11-07","court":"New York Supreme Court","content":"By the Court,\nLeonard, J.\nThere is clearly no express devise of the landed estate of the testator to his executors. A devise of an estate in lands has been implied when acts and duties to be performed under' the express directions of the will would otherwise fail; and in such a case it has been held that the intention of the testator to devise the estate to trustees is manifested, and that they take the title by implication.\nIn the present case it does not appear to be 'necessary to hold that the executors take any estate in the lands. They are authorized to sell, lease, receive rents, repair, and in case of loss or damage by fire, to apply the insurance money to rebuilding. All of these duties can be performed by the executors under the authority conferred by the will, treated as a power in trust merely.\nThe testator did not contemplate any trust. This is clear from the fact that no application is made by. the provisions of the will in respect to the large fund which would necessarily accumulate in their hands from income. The direc tioiis contained in the will would apparently absorb but a small portion of the income. A trust is created, usually, for some express object'; and is to be continued only till that object is attained, or the period limited therefor has expired. Here there is no object for a trust indicated, unless it be supposed that repairing the property is sufficient.\nBut whether the testator intended to vest the estate in trust, or to create a power in trust for its management, it will operate only upon thei shares of such of his children as were infants at the time of his death, and continue only as to each share during the infancy of the children respectively. By the second section of his will his whole estate passed to his children at the death of the testator. It would be inconsistent with this provision to hold that the title to any part of'the estate was vested in trustees, and equally inconsistent with their rights as owners for the executors to exercise a power to sell, &c. after the children had reached their majority, except for the purpose of paying debts.\nThe judge has found that there are no debts, except a very small amount, not equal to the amount of personal property. This fact seems to be sustained by the evidence. It is true, one of the witnesses had heard of a large claim, but its existence as a debt was not proved. Under such circumstances it can not be doubted that the children had a right to take and hold the land.\nThe testator appointed his executors the guardians of his minor children, and I think he intended them to act for their interest in selling the _ land, combining the exercise of the .power to sell with their duty as guardians. All the children had, however, reached their majority before the testator died, excepting only his son Thomas. When this action was commenced, Thomas was over twenty years of age, and at the trial he wanted some three months only of his majority.\nIt appears to be pretty clear that the defendants, Andrew Martin and Peter Lynch, were not guardians of Thomas Martin; for the same clause of the will which appoints Andrew and Peter guardians, also appoints Thomas a guardian over himself. As to Thomas Martin, the guardianship was inoperative under this provision.\nBut assuming that Andrew Martin had the power to sell the share of Thomas under the directions of the will, the court has the power to control its exercise when a sale is manifestly opposed to the interest of Thomas.\nThe judge at special term acting as parens patriae, could determine from the facts proven whether it was for the interest of the infant that his real estate should he converted into currency. Why, it might be well asked, could Andrew Martin choose for the infant in this respect better than the judge ? Has he more intelligence? Is he more disinterested ? It can not be doubted that the property of an infant in 1863 was safer, invested in land, than it would be if exchanged for the currency then in use.\nWhatever may be the answer to these questions, it is of very little practical importance to reverse the decision even if it could lawfully he done, as all the children, including Thomas, are now of age, and the executors can no longer exercise the power of sale under the will.\nThe exceptions taken to the refusal of the judge to admit evidence as to the habits of Thomas Martin in respect to temperance, are of no moment, as the evidence was immaterial.\nThe objection as to the admission of the written statement of the wishes of Thomas Martin, in respect to the sale of the real estate, is not well taken. Ho argument can be urged against its admission, except its want of materiality. If the evidence had been excluded, it does not appear that the judge could have arrived at any other decision of the case.\nThe only conclusion to be drawn from the statement is, that Thomas thought very much as the judge did. As evidence, the statement had no operation.\nProbably the defendants acted honestly in their wish to sell; and in defending this action I think their costs should be allowed them out of the fund.\n[New York General Term,\nNovember 7, 1864.\nThe judgment should be affirmed, and -the costs of both parties on the appeal paid from the estate.\nLeonard, Geo, G.

J.\nIf the statute of 1859 can be sustained as an exercise of the legislative power of local taxation, several of the suggestions, which it would otherwise be necessary to consider, will be inapplicable. When the State, or a local division of it, acting under a law of the State, seizes and sells land for the non-payment of taxes, or of public charges in the nature of taxes imposed on such land, the proceeding is administrative and not judicial. The legislature may or may not make use of judicial forms or judicial tribunals, as shall seem most convenient, or most conducive to the object in view, and most advantageous to the State and to the taxpayers. The general laws for the assessment and levying of State and county taxes, and the special statutes under which assessments are laid and collected in cities and villages, are examples of this kind of legislation. No judgment of a court is ordinarily required from the commencement to the conclusion of the process, and if a judicial agency for some part of the proceeding is provided in particular cases, as in the confirmation of the report of commissioners of estimate and assessment in the city of New York, it is not because the matter is judicial in its nature, or because such a mode of determining questions is, in such cases, required by any provision of the Constitution, but merely from considerations of convenience and general propriety. This principle is not disputed by the counsel for the purchasers in this case, so far as the imposing of the burthens which were sought to be enforced by those sales are concerned. It is not questioned but that the assessments were legally laid upon the several portions of the farm devised by the will of John Baker. By the general law the mode of enforcing payment of such assessments was, by exposing the several portions separately charged to a sale for the shortest term of years for which any one would take them and pay the assessment and the charges. It would have been equally within the power of the legislature to have provided that the whole or a portion of the premises charged should have been sold in fee simple, as is done in respect to State, town and county taxes; and whether one or the other mode should be resorted to, was simply a question of legislative discretion. By an act passed in 1855 (ch. 321), it was provided that where there were present and future estates in the same land, vested or contingent, so that the distribution of a burthen charged upon it by tax or assessment among the different owners would raise questions of difficulty, any party in interest was entitled to apply to the court by action to be commenced against the other owners, who were to be brought in by process or advertisement, and the court was authorized to give judgment for a sale in fee simple of the whole or such part of the land charged as should be required to pay the tax, and an order was to be made for a just and equitable apportionment of the burthen among the several owners, and for the application of the proceeds of the sale accordingly. This was, no doubt, an expedient enactment, but it was not required by any constitutional principle. The legislature might have directed the land to be sold in fee, or for a term, and have left the question open to adjustment between the parties by ordinary action between themselves.\nThe act of 1859 (ch. 392) was a law of the same general nature. It seems to assume that there was some reason of justice, or convenience, for taking assessments laid upon the parcel of land devised by John Baker, out of the general provisions of law for enforcing assessments for public improvements. As to a part if not the whole of it, there was a present and one or more future estates, which assimilated the case to those provided for by the act of 1855. But the act of 1859, now in question, is special and limited in its operation, being confined to the forty-five acres of land devised by Baker, and affects only the persons interested in that land. It is rarely judicious to direct acts of legislation to the case of a limited number of persons, or to a separate parcel of property. It is ordinarily, if not always, better to leave every person to the operation of the general laws of the State; and where these are found to operate unequally there are usually principles of the common law which will enable the parties to adjust the rights and equities which exist between themselves. The act of 1859 is also peculiar in applying the new method of enforcing payment, to assessments which had been laid and confirmed prior to the passage of the act, as well as to future assessments. Two questions then arise: first, whether the act is invalid on account of its restricted character in respect to the persons and property to be affected; and second, whether it is invalid on account of the circumstance that it is made applicable to existing assess ments, and provides a method for the enforcement, different from that which was provided by law when the assessments were made.\nFirst. A few years ago a case arose in the second judicial district respecting the validity of a local assessment. By an ordinance of the city of Brooklyn, passed in conformity with the charter of that city, the expense of constructing a sewer for the particular benefit of the owners of property upon certain streets, was directed to be assessed upon a specified district embracing the lots fronting on those streets. The proceedings of the city council were removed into the Supreme Court by ceriiora\/ri, where they were reversed and set aside by the General Term in that district, on the ground that the legislature had no authority to provide for the imposing of such a burthen upon a locality other than one of the local divisions of the State. The principle was laid down in the opinion of the court in this language: \u201c Legitimate taxation is limited to the imposing of burthens, or charges, for a public purpose, equally upon the persons or property within a district known or recognized by law as possessing a local sovereignty for certain purposes, as a State, county, town, village, &c.and the court conceded that the rule would exclude from the operation of the taxing power all those cases in which the expenses of laying out public squares, of opening or widening streets, or of other like improvements, are charged upon certain persons or property in consequence of supposed benefits. (The People v. The Mayor, &c., of Brooklyn, 6 Barb., 209, An. 1849.) Shortly after-wards a case arising in the same city, involving the same principle and decided in the same way by the Supreme Court, was heard in this court upon appeal. The whole doctrine of assessments for local improvements was elaborately considered in a very interesting opinion prepared by Judge Buggles, in which the views of the Supreme Court on the first mentioned ease were carefully examined, and this court, with the concurrence of all the judges, reversed the judgment appealed from. It was held that raising money for a local improvement was an exercise of the taxing power inherent in the legislature, and that this power of taxation implied a power to apportion the tax (territorially), as the legislature should see fit, and moreover that this power of apportionment had no limit where there was no constitutional restraint, and that the constitutional inhibition against depriving a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, and forbidding private property from being taken for public use without just compensation, had no application to the case. The principle might be further illustrated by reference to legislative precedents and adjudged cases, but the opinion of Judge Ruggles furnishes all which it seems necessary to be said upon the question. It follows, from what has been observed, that it would have been legally competent for the legislature to have formed the parcel of land devised by Baker into a separate district for the purpose of administration respecting assessments for public improvements, and to have subjected it to a system of local legislation different from that which prevailed in other portions of the city. It is true that the reasons which influenced the legislature in the cases like those arising in Brooklyn, namely, the compelling the persons and property locally benefitted to defray the expenses of the improvements, were different from those which one may suppose to have prevailed in enacting the statute of 1859. The condition of the title to the property was, doubtless, in the latter case the motive for subjecting it to an exceptional system. But the power of the legislature being established, they are the sole judges of the motives upon which they shall proceed, and their will must stand for the reason of their act. I have not laid any stress upon the circumstance, that all the parties having an apparent interest were notified, and actually appeared, in the proceedings which followed the presentation of the petition of the school corporation. The case not being in its nature within any of the general laws which regulate judicial processes, it was sufficient if the parties promoting the proceedings conformed to the special prescriptions of the statute, and this appears .to have been done. And it was not essential to the constitutional legality of the statute that it should have authorized a jui*y trial, or in any other way have conformed to the rules which relate to judicial controversies between citizen and citizen. In executing the taxing power, the legislature provides such agencies and safeguards against surprise, mistake or injustice as is thought expedient. It is manifestly proper that the tax-payers should have notice of the imposition proposed to be laid upon them, and an opportunity for making suggestions and explanations to the proper administrative board or officer; and this is generally secured in all well considered systems of taxation. But it is for the legislature to determine and prescribe in every case what shall be sufficient,- and there is not, that I am aware of, any constitutional provision bearing on the subject. It has been made a question whether the act under consideration authorizes a sale in fee simple. It provides for a sale and conveyance in general terms without any allusion to a lesser estate than one in fee. The assessments which were to be satisfied bound the land as such, and all estates and interests which every person had in it, and there is nothing in the act to suggest the idea that a partial interest was to be the subject of the sale.\nSecond. As to the assessments already established, and where nothing remained but to enforce the payment of such assessments, the statute took up the matter in med\u00c1o\u00a1 and changed the system under which the collection was to be made. The obligation to pay the amounts had been created, and the land had been charged according-to the pre-existing law. I do not perceive any constitutional objection to the change which was made. The act of 1855, the constitutionality of which has been established, presented the same feature; The proceeding was subjected to the new system even where it had gone so far as a sale of the premises for a term of years. A sale of a part under the judgment of a court was authorized for the purpose of raising money to effect a redemption, or to pay the tax if a sale had not taken place. This act of 1855 had been held constitutional by an express judgment of this court. (Jackson v. Babcock, 16 N. Y., 246.) It does not distinctly appear whether the assessment in question, in that case, had been laid before the passage of the act, but from a comparison of the dates I think it must have been so. But, however this may have been, the power of the legislature to regulate and change the forms of \u2018procedure in all cases, where no vested rights have been acquired under the existing law, cannot be questioned. (Stocking v. Hunt, 3 Denio, 274; Gould v. Morse, 1 Kern., 281.) Many of the amendments of the Code of Procedure, as is well known, were made to take effect upon existing suits.\nThere is a point made in the affidavits of the purchasers, and repeated in the brief of their counsel, that some of the lots were sold under the proceedings had before the Special Term, after sufficient had been raised by the prior sales to pay all the valid assessments existing against the land when the order for the sale was made, and when the sale took place. I think it was not the intention of the act to provide by sales of parts of the land for a fund to pay indefinite future assessments when they should be made. The Supreme Court, it is true, is authorized to order sales of any such portions of the lands \u201c as shall be necessary to pay any assessment or assessments imposed, or to be imposed, upon the said land.\u201d (Sec. 1.) This expression, I think, was used to show that the remedy was to be a continuous one, and to apply to cases of future assessments when they should be made, and not to confer an authority to sell in advance of such assessments and such sales, to satisfy prospective charges of that nature, which would scarcely fall within any just idea of exercising the power of taxation; and if not, it would be difficult to defend such a provision from the charge of violating the constitutional injunction which secures private property from legislative confiscation. But assuming the construction of the act to be such as I have supposed, I do not perceive that too many lots have been sold. The amount of unpaid assessments, as ascertained by the referee\u2019s report, and determined by the order, was $26,600.52; but of this amount $18,533.12 were challenged as illegal assessments, and it was said that suits were pending to set them aside. The court fixed upon a definite parcel, distinctly described, as necessary and proper to be sold, and this parcel was to be and was in fact divided into convenient lots by the referee, who was charged with the duty of selling, and he sold so many lots as brought $18,790. This was less than the aggregate amount of the unpaid assessments as ascertained by the order, but more than the sum of those which were undisputed. It was competent for the court to order a sale to the amount of the unpaid assessments, though questions might be made as to some of them, and the sales which were actually made, would have been valid, upon the facts appearing upon the papers, prior to the motion of the purchasers. Upon that motion it was shown on them part, that the disputed assessments had been adjudged void by a competent court, before the sale took place, but the corporation showed upon its part, that the progress of municipal improvement had not ceased while these proceedings were progressing; but on the contrary, between the report of the first referee and the sale, additional assessments to the amount of $72,260.64 were laid upon different parts of the premises; and that after the sale and before the hearing of the motion to be relieved, several other large amounts were assessed, so that at the last mentioned period the premises, or parts of them, were legally chargeable with the large sum of $22,374, exclusive of interest. But it may be said that the lots should not have been sold to pay assessments, which were not in existence when the proceeding was commenced, or at least at the date of the report, on which the order for sale was made. The answer given to this is, that the order of sale provided, in terms, that the referee appointed to make the sale should apply the purchase-money in the first place to the satisfaction of all valid liens upon the property sold, which was directed for the purpose of giving to the purchasers an unencumbered title; and then the residue of the pimehase-money was to be applied to the satisfaction of valid assessments existing at the time of the report of the first referee, so that the actual produce of the sales was not the nominal amount at which the lots were struck off to the purchasers, but the surplus after deducting the amount paid to extinguish the intervening liens. In the statement made on behalf of the purchasers, to show the sum which, under the order of sale was to he raised, the damages assessed in favor of the governor as trustee was deducted, as it ought to have been if it had been paid; but it was shown on the other side that the city comptroller had refused to pay it over. Hence, the amount to be raised by the sales was not reduced by that circumstance. If it shall be eventually paid pursuant to the direction of the order, it is evident that there will be sufficient employment for it in the payment of subsequent assessments. I conclude, therefore, that it has not been shown that any lots were sold after the power to sell had been exhausted.\nThe result of these views is, that the sale in question was made pursuant to a valid act of the legislature passed in the execution of the power of local taxation.\nI have assumed hitherto, that there was some interest in the Baker farm belonging to parties who were not required by the act of 1859 to participate, and who did not in fact participate in the legal proceedings which were had in the Supreme Court, and who could not, therefore, be affected by those proceedings. The act itself exempts from the effect of the sale the interest of any lessee, (other of course than the petitioners), and also of the heirs of Baker. The latter, if they exist, could have no estate, provided the devise to the governor of the ultimate remainder, was valid. On the supposition that it was not valid, they would be seized of a vested interest in reversion, and the question would be, whether the absence of heirs of Baker was so conclusively shown that the land would be forced upon the purchasers by the Court of Equity. Baker died sixty-seven years ago in the city of Hew York, leaving no. descendants, and without any known collateral relatives in this country. One of the witnesses examined before the referee understood that he had-a brother, one Sir Charles Baker, in England. The petition contains the following statements on the point: \u201cthat no person has at any time, or in any way set up, or asserted, any claim to said premises as an heir-at-law of said John Baker, to the information or belief of your petitioners, that as they are informed, and believe, he left no descendants now surviving, and that his collateral relations and their descendants, were alien subjects of the king of Great Britain, and incapable of taking said premises by inheritance, and that your petitioners have no notice or information of any kind, or degree, that there is any person whatever claiming to be, or reported to be, an heir or relative of John Baker.\u201d And the referee reports that he finds all material statements in the petition to be true. But as by the act the rights of the heirs, if there were any, were expressly saved, there, is nothing in the nature of an estoppel by judgment in these procedings, to affect them if they should hereafter appear. It is to be observed also that the estate in reversion has not yet taken effect in possession, the life estates not having yet terminated, and that by possibility the persons entitled as heirs may be awaiting the extinction of those estates to enter upon their inheritance. Still if there had been any collateral heirs who were residents of or residents in this. country, according to all common experience their existence would have been known in the city of Sew York. Although not yet entitled to the enjoyment of the estate, by reason of the prior limitation, they would as reversioners have been interested in its management, and in any transaction respecting the title, and it is scarcely conceivable that some one of the numerous persons to whom interests in the property were given by the will of Baker, would not have been made aware of their existence. It is more easy to suppose that there may be descendants of collateral relatives extant in England, but being aliens to this country, they would be incapable of inheriting. Upon this branch of the case my conclusion, formed with some hesitation I admit, is, that the existence of heirs is so improbable that it is not to be considered as prejudicing the title. The purchasers have all the title which the State can confer, and if the land has escheated for defect of heirs of Baker, or their alienage, those purchasers will by force of the act of 1806, hold under the title by escheat. Supposing the devise of the final remainder to have been void, it was still a devise in terms for the use and benefit of the Protestant Episcopal Charity School, and was therefore embraced within the provisions of the seventh section of the act, which authorizes the corporation to take and held all estates so devised. The act would at least furnish a good title as against the State.\nBut I am of the opinion that the devise to the governor for the time being, in trust to take and receive the rents and profits of the land, and apply them to the education and support of the charity scholars of this school, was a valid charitable devise. The school it is true, was not incorporated, but it was a distinct and well known institution, and there was a competent trustee authorized to take when the remainder should vest in possession. The case of Williams v. Williams (4 Seld., 525), determined that the law of charitable uses, as it existed in England at the time of the revolution, and the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery over the subject, became the law of this State upon the adoption of the Constitution of 1777. In that case, as in this, the direct disposition was to a trustee competent to take an estate devised upon valid trusts, though that was not considered material by the judge by whom the opinion was prepared. Subsequent cases in this court have perhaps limited the application of the doctrine to devises which presented that feature, namely, the existence of a competent trustee. (Owens v. The Missionary Society, 14 N. Y., 380; Downing v. Marshall, 366, 382.) But that qualification is not material here. The present, therefore, is a valid charitable gift, upon all the cases.\nBefore considering the effect of the act of 1806, it may be useful to determine the legal character of the last remainder limited by the will, assuming it to be valid, upon the question, whether it was vested in interest or contingent. The general if not the universal rule is, that where there is a person in being in whom the estate in remainder would vest in possession if the precedent estate should immediately terminate, it is vested in interest, though it may not be certain that such person will be living or qualified to take at the actual cessation of the prior estate. (Fearne on Bern., p. 215; Lawrence v. Bayard, 7 Paige, 70; 1 R. S., 724; Sec. 13.) Tested by that rule, the remainder expectant upon the expiration of the life estate would vest in the governor who was in office at the death of John Baker. But we know with certainty that this would be contrary to the intention of the testator, for the language of the will is, that he gives and devises the land \u201cfrom and immediately after the determination of the said several estates for life by the death of the several devisees for life, unto the governor of the said State of Eew York for the time being P This is equivalent to saying that the governor, who shall be in office at the death of the last tenant for life, shall take the land as devisee in trust for the charity. There is no succession in the line of the governors of the State of property devised to them by private parties for extra-official purposes, such as exists between heir and ancestor, or in the officers of corporations, and, therefore, the remainder would not descend from governor to governor, as changes should happen in the incumbency of that office. The land is given to the governor who was intended to take, in fee simple, and hence the legal estate would descend to the heirs, or pass to the devisees, of the governor who should first die seized of the remainder. But it was certainly very remote from the intention of the testator that at the falling in of the life estate, the charitable devisees should be obliged to look up the representatives of the governor who was in office at some period during a former generation. My opinion, upon considerable examination and reflection, is, that the remainder vested in interest in fee simple, in the governor who was in office at the death of the testator, subject to be defeated by the fact of the incumbency of a different person at the time of the termination of the life estate. \u2022 This last limitation would be a valid executory devise, and would not be void for remoteness, for it must take effect at the termination of specified lives in being. It is of the essence of such conditional litiiitations that they are not capable of being defeated by any act of the person seized of the precedent estate in fee. Such a construction of the limitations of the will as I have suggested, would be consistent with the intention of the testator, that the governor in office at the death of the last tenant for Efe, would be the person to take the absolute estate in fee, for the purposes of the trust, and would not violate the rule just referred to, requiring a remainder to vest at the commencement of the estate for life, if there is then a person in existence competent to take, if the estates for Efe should immediately terminate. The point is material only to show that the approval of the act of 1806 by the governor then in office, Morgan Lewis, could not be made use of to defeat the estate of the governor who shall fiE the office at the expiration of the life estate. If that had happened during his official term the act of approving the law would probably have estopped him, but it can have no effect upon the executory limitation. I forbear to enlarge upon this view, or to refer to authorities in its support, because in my view the act can be supported upon the principles to be immediately stated.\nThe act of 1806, if liable to no constitutional objection, had the force of a law, and divested the estate of the trustee referred to in the wiE in favor of the school corporation, who thereupon became seized of the estate for the purpose of the charity. It has been decided in this court that the legislature has no constitutional power to cause land to be sold for the purpose of disentangling an estate, where the parties entitled to future estates are under no disability and are competent to act for themselves, though it is fully admitted that it may be done where the rights of infants, lunatics, &c., are concerned (Nowers v. Biegen, 3 Seld., 358), and by a series of cases in this court and the late court for the correction of errors, as weE as in the courts of original jurisdiction, it is firmly estabEshed that the legislature has full power to order sales of the estates of infants for the purpose of unfettering the title for the support of the infants, or for any reasons connected with their interests and welfare. (Clark v. Vam, Sorlay, 15 Wend., 436; S. C., in error, 20 id., 365; Towle v. Forney, 14 N. Y., 423; Williamson v. Moore, Court of Appeals, March Term, 1862.) A great number of statutes have been passed for these purposes during almost the whole existence of the State government, and which may be readily found without citation here. In the second and in the last of these cases the authority to pass such laws is deduced from the sovereign power, which is vested in the government, to superintend the interests, and provide for the welfare of infant children and lunatics, and which, under the system prevailing in England, is vested in the king, who is said in such cases to act as parens patriae, and which the Court of Chancery usually exercises by delegation from the sovereign. Now, by referring to the English books, it will appear that the same power which is vested in the crown, touching parties under the disability of infancy and lunacy, embraces the case of property given for the purposes of charity, and it is vested in the sovereign in the same paternal character. (Shelf, on Mortmain, pp. 267, 268, 399, 691, note d.) And there are several adjudications in the courts of this State to the same effect. In the case of The Elder, &c., of the First Baptist Church in, Hartford v. Witherall (3 Paige, 296) real estate had been granted by private individuals to the plaintiffs under the name by which they had associated as an unincorporated religious society. By the act for the incorporation of religious societies it was provided, in language very similar to the act of 1806 under consideration, that a church, when incorporated under that act, should be authorized to take into its possession all the property of the society, whether the same was given directly to such church or society, or to any other person for their use, and to hold such property as fully and amply as if the right or title thereto had been originally vested in the trustees of the corporation. The First Baptist Church in Hartford afterwards became incorporated under the act, and the cotirt held that the title to the property vested in the corporation by force of the act. A similar decision was made in The Dutch Church v. Mott (7 Paige, 81, 82), and in Inglis v. The Sailors' Snug Harbor a devise was held valid which provided for vesting the property in a corporation to be thereafter created. (3 Pet., 114.)\nIf I am right in these last positions, the act of 1806 was a valid exercise of legislative authority, and operated according to the intent to extinguish the title of the governor in office, and of all future governors, and to vest the remainder in the school corporation. That corporation having subsequently become the grantee of the surviving devisees for life in the whole of the Baker farm, except the ten acres leased to Hogg, it was seized of an absolute fee simple of the lots sold under this proceeding, and the purchasers will, upon the execution of the conveyances, acquire a perfect title to their lots.\nI have purposely omitted until now, to consider one of the points insisted on by the counsel for the purchasers. It is argued that the devise was not for the benefit of the school mentioned in the will, but of the individual charity scholars, and hence, that it is not within the scope of the act of 1806, which speaks of property which may have been devised for the use or benefit of the Protestant Episcopal Charity School. The children were not to take any benefit except as belonging to the charity school; considered independently of the school, no poor children had any connection with the gift. The general intendment of such a disposition of property is, that the care and instruction mentioned is to be dispensed by the institution to whom the .scholars are confided, and where clothing and maintenance are to be furnished, they would naturally, if not necessarily, come through the same channel. According to the common understanding, a gift to the children belonging to an existing school, of such benefits as the school was accustomed to furnish, would be a gift to the school. The scholars are' a fluctuating class of persons who would be incapable of taking such benefits, except through some medium competent to supply them. This would be my judgment of the natural effect of the will if there was no authority for the doctrine. But the precise case has arisen in the English Court of Chancery. In The Attorney General v. Tancred (Amb., 351), it appeared that a testator had devised land to trustees to pay the profits to twelve students to be educated at Christ\u2019s College, Caius College and Lincoln\u2019s Inn. The devise being a charity was void by the mortmain act, 9th Geo. 2d, chap. 36, except as the universities and their colleges which were especially excepted in the fourth section of the act. The Lord Keeper said: \u201c The heir-at-law insists that the devises are void as to the eight studentships, because they are not given in termmis for the benefit of the colleges, and therefore not within the word or meaning of the exception in the statute. But I am of opinion that such dispositions are for the benefit and advantage of the colleges and within the meaning of the exception.\u201d A more pointed decision of the question could scarcely be made.\nIn whatever light I have been able to view the questions, I am of opinion that the purchasers will have a good title. I am, therefore, in favor of reversing the order appealed from, and of requiring the respondents to complete their purchase and of charging them with the costs.\nAll the judges concurred in the result.\nOrder reversed, and the respondents required to complete their purchase and to pay costs."},{"case_name":"LORING et al. v. MARSH et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6642397\/","date":"1865-10-01","court":"United States Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts","content":"CLIFFORD. Circuit Justice.\nObviously the first question involved is the construction of the statute of wills, and therefore is a question of local law. The universal rale is, in eases depending on the statute of a state, and more especially in those respecting the titles to lands, that the federal courts adopt the construction of the state tribunals when that construction is settled or can be ascertained. Where the construction is settled by the state court, the rule is, that the federal courts will follow that construction; but when the question has not been decided by the state court, then the duty of ascertaining the true construction in the particular case is necessarily devolved upon the tribunal where the case is pending. The language of the provision under consideration is as follows: \"When a testator omits to provide in his will for any of his children, or for the issue of a deceased child, they shall take the same share of his estate, both real and personal, that they would have been entitled to il he had died intestate, unless they shall have been provided for by the testator in his lifetime, or unless it appears that such omission was intentional, and not occasioned by accident or mistake.\u201d Gen. St. Mass. 1SG0, c. 92, p. 478, \u00a7 2\u00f3. The same provision, and substantially in. the same words, is contained in the statutes of the state, called the \u201cRevised Statutes,\u201d passed twenty-four years earlier. Indeed the substance of the provision as held by the courts, may be traced'back to colonial times. The colonial statute of 12 Wm. III.,passed in the year 1700, provided in its second section that any child or children, not having a legacy given them in the will of their father or mother, shall have a proportion of the estate of their parents given and set out unto them as the law directs for the distribution of the estates of intestates, provided such child or children have not had an equal proportion of his estate bestowed on them by the father in his lifetime. The preamble of the section refers specially to the fact also that many children are born after the making of the will, showing conclusively that after-born children, as well as those omitted in the will who were in being at its date, were intended to be included. Doubts, however, arose whether it included grandchildren, but the legislature, on the 18th of May, 1718, passed a resolve declaring the affirmative of the proposition, and such, ever after, was the received construction. Ancient Charters, c. 7, p. 351, \u00a7 2. The phraseology of the provision was somewhat changed in the act of the 6th of February, 1784, and the preamble was entirely left out. 1 Laws Mass. 1800, p. 111. By the eighth section of that act it is provided that any child or children, or their .legal representatives, in case of their death, not having a legacy given him, her, or them in the will of their father or mother, shall have a proportion of the estate of their parents assigned unto him. her, or them, as though such parent had died intestate, provided such child, children, or grandchildren have not had an equal proportion of the deceased\u2019s estate bestowed on him, her, or them in the deceased's lifetime. The earliest decision of the courts of the state upon the subject is that of Wild v. Brewer, decided in 1797. and reported in the supplement of 2 Mass. 571. The testator in that ease devised the income and improvement of his real estate to his wife, during her natural life, and then directed that, at her decease, the same should be divided among his grandchildren, describing them by their respective names, and as \u201cchildren of my daughter Sarah,\u201d giving the estate to them \u201cin equal parts or portions forever, for them to improve and dispose of as they may see fit,\u201d but he made no provision for his daughter, the mother of the devisees. She, with her husband, petitioned for partition of the estate, claiming a distributive share as heir atlaw.andthe case was submitted to thecourt, upon an agreed statement of facts. Held, that she was not entitled to a portion of the estate as though the testator had died intestate. The'next ease is that of Terry v. Foster, 1 Mass. 146, decided in 1804, and is the first case upon the subject reported in the regular series of reports. The appellants in that case were the grandchildren of the testator; and the report of the case shows that their mother, the daughter of the testator, deceased before the date of the will. The material provision of the will was: \u201cI give to my daughter Mary Russell, five dollars, and to my daughter Bushop. five dollars; to my grandchildren of my daughter Terry, deceased, to be paid to them when the youngest of them comes of age.\u201d Doubts were entertained by all the judges, whether any legacy was actually given to the appellants, but they all held that the act of the 6th of February, 1784, did not repeal the colonial statute, and that any child or grandchild being noticed or mentioned in a will showed that he was not forgotten; that the statutes taken together \u00e1s in pari materia, extended only to cases of entire omission; that it was not necessary that the child or grandchild should have a legacy to exclude them, but that it was sufficient if it appeared by the will that the testator had not overlooked the claimant. Three years later the case of Church v. Crocker, 3 Mass. 17, was presented for decision. The report of the case shows that the testatrix in that case, gave one-fifth part of the residue of her estate to her six grandchildren, the children of her son Edward, but no legacy was given to Edward himself. The argument for the plaintiff was, that inasmuch as no legacy was given him in the will, he was undeniably entitled to a distributive share in the estate; but the court held otherwise, after the fullest consideration. Public policy, say the court, requires that the right of testamentary disposition in parents respecting their children, should be exercised at their discretion; and they held that the intention of the eighth section was. not to limit this discretion as distinctly conferred by the first section of the act, but to provide for a child or grandchild when this discretion from accident or some other cause had not been exercised. The conclusion was, that when a child is named in his parent\u2019s will, although he has no legacy given him, he is not entitled to a distributive shave of the estate, because that fact shows that the child was in the mind of the testator at the time the will was prepared, and consequently that it cannot be held that he was omitted by accident or mistake. The last case under that statute is that of Wilder v. Goss, 14 Mass. 357, which has an important bearing upon the question under consideration. It is shown by the statement of the case that the daughter of the testator died before the testator, and before he made his will, leaving seven children who survived their grandfather. The wife of the appellant claimed a distributive share in the estate, as heir at law, because she had no legacy given her in the will, and was not named in the same. 'The name of the mother of the claimant was Rebecca Thurston. Among other things, the testator stated in the will that having before that time conveyed to his son-in-law, John Thurston, the principal part of his real estate, he should make no further devise to him, but gave a legacy to Thomas Thurston, brother of the claimant, and then the residue \u2022of his estate to his other three daughters, who were living. The facts show that the \u2022claimant was an heir at law to the estate of the testator when the will was made, and that she neither had any legaey given her nor was she named in the will. But the court held that the mention of her father by the testator as his son-in-law, and the giving of a legacy to her brother, must have brought the recollection of his deceased \u25a0daughter to his mind, and showed that the family was in his remembrance, and consequently that she, was not entitled to a proportion of the estate. Whenever it appears,' \u25a0 say the court, that the testator has, through forgetfulness or mistake, omitted to bestow anything upon his child or grandchild, the legislature wisely intended to effect that which it was highly reasonable to believe the testator, but for such forgetfulness or mistake, would himself have done. But the court insist that to go further than that, would be to defeat the principal intention of the legislature in tlie first section of the act, which authorizes every person seized of an \u2022 estate in lands which may extend beyond his own life, to devise the same as he shall see fit. Consequently, whenever it may fairly be presumed from the tenor of the will, or of any clause in it, that the testator intentionally omits to give a legacy or to make a devise to his child or grandchild, whose parent is dead, the court will not interfere. Such were the views of the supreme court of the state, in the several cases which arose under the statute of the Cth of February, 1784; but the court went further in the case of Wilson v. Fosket, 6 Metc. [Mass.] 400, which is a case that arose under the Revised Statutes of 1S3G, and held that it was not necessary that it should appear by the will itself that such omission was intentional, but that it may be shown by parol proof; and such, it | \u00a1 | is believed, is the settled doctrine of the state I court.\nReferring to the prior decisions, the court .ay the construction has been, that whenever, from the tenor of the will or from any part of it, sufficient appeared to indicate that .the testator had not forgotten his children or grandchildren (as the case might be) when he made his will, they would not be entitled to a distributive share of his estate, although no legacy was given them by the will. The emphatic language of the court is, that whatever may have been the grounds of the decision, it came to be well settled that the object of the prior statute was to furnish a remedy solely for those cases where, from accident or other causes, the child or grandchild might be supposed to have been really forgotten by the testator in making his will.\nReference is then made to the decided cases which affirm that doctrine, and it is undoubtedly true that they sustain the proposition. The construction given to the provision in the prior act was adopted in the Revised Statutes, which \u201cintroduced the broad principle of barring a child of a claim to a distributive share, upon its being made to appear that such omission to give a legacy was intentional and not occasioned by any mistake or accident\u201d Wilson v. Fosket, C Metc. [Mass.] 404, decided in 1844. After-born children, it will be remembered, were included in the provision contained in the colonial statute, and the twenty-second section of the Revised Statutes expressly provided that when any child of a testator, born after the father\u2019s death, shall have no provision made for him by his father in his will or otherwise, he shall take the same share of his father\u2019s estate, both real and personal, that he would have been entitled to if his father had died intestate. Rev. St. 1830, p. 419. Explicit as this provision is, it still left the question as to what the rule should be in a case where a child was born after the making of the will and before the death of the father, quite undetermined. No such question was presented to the state court until 1855, when it came up in the case of the will of Thomas P. Bancroft. Bancroft v. Ives, 3 Gray, 367. The agreed statement in the case shows that the testator, having married the plaintiff in that- ease, had three children by her, and made his will, giving a legacy to each of the children and the residue to his wife. Said children all died in the lifetime of the testator, unmarried and without issue. But two other children were afterwards born to him, who were in full life at the date of the controvei'sy. Plaintiff claimed the whole estate, but the court held that the provision under which any child for whom its father \u201cshall omit to provide in his will is entitled to a share in his estate, unless such omission was intentional,\u201d applies also to children born after the making of the will and before the death of the father? Speaking of that provision as contained in the Revised Statutes, the court say: \u201cWe think it manifest that it was not the intention of the commissioners and legislature to alter the law in this respect, but only to give effect to the old statute, and to affirm and give the authority of positive law to the construction which had been put upon it in several ca.ses.\u201d Some of the remarks of the chief justice who gave the opinion, are supposed to be inconsistent with that view of the law, but the opinion itself affords conclusive refutation of that suggestion. Proof of that statement is found in the quotation already given from the opinion, and if more be needed, it will be found in the fact that the court cites with approbation every one of the prior cases which contributed to establish that construction. Omission to provide for children born after the will and before the death of the father, may well be regarded as occasioned by accident or mistake, in a case where the will, made before their birth, gave legacies to all the living children. Hence the court say in that case, \u201ctaking his will and the legacies therein given to the children then living, it appears that it was not his intent to omit any of his children, but to give each a legacy,\u201d as therein provided.\nThe true rule therefore is, that a child or the issue of a deceased child, when the testator omits to provide for him in his will, is entitled to a distributive share in the estate, unless it appears that such omission was intentional, and not occasioned by accident or mistake. \u201cWhenever, from the tenor of the will, or from any part of it, or from parol proofs, or both combined, sufficient appears to show that the testator had not forgotten his children or grandchildren, as the case may be, when he made his will, no such child or grandchild is entitled to a distributive share in his estate, although no legacy was given him by the will.\u201d Direct decision is made to that effect in Wilson v. Fosket, 6 Metc. [Mass.] 403; and there is nothing in the remarks of the chief justice in Bancroft v. Ives, 3 Gray, 370. to overrule or qualify that doetrine. Undoubtedly a testator may revoke, republish, alter, or modify his will by any codicil or number of codicils quite up to the time of his death; and in that sense, it may be said that a man\u2019s will is ambulatory; but it by no means follows, if a man makes a will and dies without revoking, republishing, altering, or modifying it, that it must not be construed as of the date when it was made; and if if appears that a child or grandchild having no legacy was intentionally omitted, and not by accident or mistake, such child or grandchild is not entitled to a distributive share. It must be so, else it is not true, as is provided in the first section of the statute of wills, that every person of full age and of sound mind, may devise and dispose of his estate therein described, by his last will and testament in writing. Nothing need be said in explanation of the remark that all th'e testamentary papers, in force and capable of taking effect at the decease of the testator, constitute his will, as it is a remark which all must approve, and in that view, unquestionably the time to which the question of omission applies, is the time of the testator's decease; but it cannot be that the court in that case intended to hold that evidence of prior acts and declarations of the testator were not admissible, as tending to show whether the supposed omission was or was not. intentional at the time the will was made. Assuming such to be the effect of that remark, then it is directly contrary to the ruling in Wilson v. Fosket, 6 Metc. [Mass.] 403, and is expressly overruled by the case of Converse v. Wales, 4 Allen, 512, which is the latest case upon the subject. It was alleged in that case, that the omission was intentional, and that it was not occasioned by accident or mistake; and to prove those facts, the respondents were allowed to introduce evidence of the declarations of the testator, made before and after the will, during a period of twenty years, and they were also allowed to introduce several former wills, in which no provision was made for the petitioners. The instructions of the court to the jury were also to the same effect; and the petitioners excepted to the ruling of the court in admitting the evidence, and also to the instructions of the court.\nThe opinion was given by Chief Justice Bigelow. He held that in the absence of written evidence there was no mode of proving the intent of the deceased testator, in such a case, more direct and satisfactory than by his acts and declarations on the subject while living, and that the previous wills made by the testator are in the nature of declarations having a direct bearing on the issue. They tend, say the court, directly to show if the same omission exists in them as is found in the will offered for probate, that it was not occasioned by forgetfulness, mistake, or any accidental circumstances, but was the result of a well-settled and deliberately formed purpose. Doubt cannot be entertained, if prior wills are admissible to prove that the omission was intentional, that subsequent codicils are also admissible for the same purpose. Applying those principles to the present case, it is quite obvious that the question under consideration is one of fact, to be determined from the tenor of the will, the attending circumstances, and the parol proofs exhibited in the case. Take the facts as they appear on the face of the will and the codicil, and they are sufficient to show that the complainants were intentionally omitted, and not by mistake or accident. One third of the net income of the remainder of the estate was given in the will to the father of the complainants during his natural life, and he and the complainants were living at the date of the will. By the terms of the \u2022\u00ab'ill the legacy to the father was limited to his life, but the devise over for the benefit of the poor is plainly and clearly expressed, All the parties were then living; and there is not a doubt entertained by the court, as matter of fact, that it was the settled purpose of the testatrix to omit the complainants, and to dispose of the inheritance as specified in the will. Reasonably considered, nothing else can be inferred from the carefully arranged terms in which the legacy to the father and the devise over are expressed. Strong confirmation of this view is found in the terms of the codicil. The codicil was executed on the 14th of July, 1S59, after the death of Cornelia TV. Thompson, as before explained, and its language is: \u201cI revoke so much of my said will as provides for the said division or the said income, and its payment in three parts.\u201d Mention is made of the death of her daughter Cornelia, and she orders and directs that the income of the estate shall be paid, under the conditions and provisions contained in the will, to her two surviving children by their respective names, during their joint lives, and one half thereof to the survivor of them, showing, in the language of Chief Justice Bigelow, that it was the result of a well-settled and deliberately formed purpose. Irrespective, therefore, of the parol testimony, I am of the opinion that it appears, from the tenor of the will when taken witli the codicil, that the omission of the complainants, if such it may be called, was intentional, and was not occasioned by accident or mistake, within the meaning of the provision under consideration, in the Massachusetts statute of wills, as expounded by her courts. Ample provision was made for the father of the complainants, and it makes no difference that the legacy to him was limited to his life, because the fact of that limitation in the will, and its careful repetition in the codicil, especially when taken in connection with the devise over for the benefit of the poor, show conclusively that the entire disposition of the estate was in accordance with the settled purpose of the testatrix. But if there could be any doubt upon this subject, the parol testimony introduced by the principal respondent is conclusive that there is no legal merit in the claim of the complainants. Suffice it to say, without reproducing the evidence, that it is fully proved that the testatrix repeatedly said that her son should have his share of the income during his life, but that his children should not have any portion of her estate after his decease; and the witnesses say that her declaration was that the son should have the use of one third of the property during his life, and that after his decease it should go for charitable purposes. Such proofs coincide with the tenor of the will, and with all the presumptions to be drawn from the surrounding circumstances, and when considered in connection with those circumstances and the unmistakable inferences to be drawn from the tenor of the will, they afford a demonstration that the claim of the complainants has no legal foundation. Strong doubts are entertained whether grandchildren living at the date of the will of the grandfather, can ever be regarded as omitted because not named as legatees in his will, in any sense within the meaning of the statute, where it appears that their father was living at the same time, and was provided for in the will. Plainly they cannot be so regarded if the father is the donee of an inheritable estate, because it is expressly enacted, that where such a legacy is given to the father and he dies before the testator, his children shall take the legacy given to him in the will. Gen. St. c. 92, p. 479, \u00a7 28. The same conclusion must follow where the legacy to the father is of an estate for life, if the remainder is also devised, unless it be assumed that a devise by a father to his children for life and a remainder over to third persons is void, in case one of the children dies before the father, leaving issue. Grant that proposition, and then it is not true, as enacted in the first section of the statute, that every person may devise and dispose of his estate by will in writing. Carefully examined, the claim of the complainants is not founded np-on any accident or mistake in the testatrix, but it is indubitably an attempt to restrict and qualify the right of parents to dispose of their estate by testamentary devise. Children are omitted when no legacy is given them, and they are in no manner named in the will, as exemplified in the decisions of the state court. Grandchildren stand upon the same footing where it appears that their narent died before the execution of the will, because, in that state of the case, they are the issue of a deceased child, and fall directly within the provision upon that subject. Posthumous children fall within the same category, because they are within the express words of the colonial statute; and under the decisions of the courts, it is also settled that children born after the date of the will and before the death of the testator shall have the same rights. In all these cases the foundation of the right, as expounded by the courts is, that the omission was unintentional and through accident or mistake, as appears by all the decisions of the state courts. But in the case at bar, there is no such foundation or just pretence for it, and therefore the rule cannot apply. The testatrix, when she made her will, gave \u25a0 legacies to all her children, and when one deceased without issue she made a codicil, and did the same thing for all who were living, including the father of the complainants. As before stated, they were born before the will was made, and neither child nor grandchild was born after the will was executed. \u2019 All of the circumstances were in the mind of the testatrix both when she made the- will, and when she afterwards deliberately modified it, and nothing occurred subsequently, to give the least coun tenance to the theory that there was any such mistake or accident as the law contemplates, to warrant the interference of the court.\n[NOTE. This case was, upon appeal to the supreme court by the complainants, affirmed. Mr. Justice Nelson, who delivered the opinion of the court, considered at length the Massachusetts statute providing for omissions in wills of provision for children or their issue. In this case he considered that the omission was intentional. He said: \u201cOur conclusion on this branch of the case is that, upon a perusal of the provisions of the will, regard being had to the course of deci sion under the statute in the courts of the state, it sufficiently appears, especially in connection with the oral proof, that the omission to provide for the issue of the deceased son in the will was intentional, and not by accident or mistake.\u201d The contention that the power conferred by the will upon Marsh and Guild was a mere naked power, and as such not competent to be executed by the survivor, or one of these, he considers in this case not tenable. He says: \u201cInasmuch as the trustees are invested with the legal estate, in order to enable them to discharge the trusts already declared, it is well settled that the power conferred is a power coupled with an interest, which survives. on the death of one of them, and may be executed by the survivor. It is not necessary that the trustees should have a personal interest in the trust ; it is the possession of the legal estate. as a right virtute officii in the subject over which the power is to be exercised, that makes an interest, which, when coupled with the power, the latter survives. A trust, therefore, will survive when in no way beneficial to the trustee.\u201d 6 Wall. (73 \u00fc. S.) 337.]\nThe complainants'scarcely deny that the power conferred upon the trustees in the will, to select and appoint the committee, could be executed by the surviving trustee, provided it be held that the power is one coupled with an interest, but they contend that it is a mere naked power to two persons which cannot be executed by one. The substance of that provision of the will is, that \u201cwhen upon the decease of all my children, the trust fund is to be disposed of as aforesaid,\u201d that is, for the benefit of the poor, \u201cthe said Marsh and Guild, or their successors as trustees, shall select and appoint three or more gentlemen, who shall be informed of the facts by the trustees, and shall determine how, by the payments to permanently established and incorporated charitable institutions, my wish to benefit the poor will be best carried into effect,\u201d &c. Three persons were accordingly selected and appointed by the surviving trustee, and they have determined that the several corporations made parties respondents, shall be the recipients and beneficiaries of the testatrix\u2019s bounty. The record shows that the power has been executed, but it is insisted by the complainants that the proceedings are a nullity. The courts of the United States cannot exercise any equity powers, except such as are conferred by an act of congress, and those judicial powers which the high court of chancery in England under its judicial capacity, as a court of equity, possessed and exercised at the time of the formation of the constitution of the United States. Powers not judicial, exercised by the chancellor as the representative of the sovereign and by virtue of the king\u2019s prerogative as parens patriae, are not possessed by the circuit courts. Fontain v. Ravenel, 17 How. [58 U. S.] 390. The supreme court hold that the prerogative power belonging to the sovereign, has not been delegated to the federal government, but remains in the several states, and is to be exercised according to the laws and usages prevailing in. the several states. Consequently, whenever, by reason of citizenship or otherwise, a cause is brought before the federal tribunals involving the validity of a bequest or devise to \u25a0 charitable uses, the question to be considered always is, whether it would be held valid' or not in the courts of the state. Numerous decisions of the supreme court assert this doctrine, and it has been the uniform course of the court. Trustees of Philadelphia Baptist Ass\u2019n v. Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 1; Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. [27 U. S.] 566; Inglis v. Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. [28 U. S.] 99; Wheeler v. Smith, 9 How. [50 U. S.] 55. The state decisions cited for the principal respondent show beyond controversy, that the equitable jurisdiction of the supreme court of the state is established over charities in its broadest application; that the statute of Elizabeth is part of the common law of the state, and that it is the settled course of judicial decisions that a devise of property to charitable uses will be upheld. Argument in support of those propositions is unnecessary, as the authorities to support them are numerous, direct, and conclusive. Authority to select and appoint the committee was not a personal trust, because it is expressly provided in the will that it shall be exercised by the persons named, or their successors as trustees. The directions of the testatrix in that behalf were not to be carried out until the decease of all her children, and as they or sorpe one of them might live for many years, it was provided, that if the persons named as trustees deceased before the time designated for the selection and appointment arrived, the duty might be performed by their successors.\nThe terms of the will show that the entire estate was vested in the trustees, and their successors as trustees, and they were authorized to sell and convey any and all real estate which might at any time be in their hands, according to their joint and sole discretion. Looking at the terms of the will, no doubt is entertained that the power in question is one coupled with an interest. Such a power survives, and may be exercised by a surviving trustee, or by successors. Butler v. Bray, 2 Dyer, 189; Attorney General v. Gleg, 1 Atk. 356; Lewin, Trusts, 299. Suppose, however, that any doubt could arise upon the subject under the general equity law, still, the decisions of the state courts fully support the proposition, and they must be regarded as conclusive. Greene v. Borland, 4 Metc. [Mass.] 330; Dixon v. Homer, 12 Cush. 43; Dexter v. Gardner, 7 Allen, 243.\nSufficient has already been remarked to show that the third proposition of the complainants cannot be sustained, because it is made to appear that the intention of the testatrix to give the property for the benefit of the poor, has been legally carried into effect. Other propositions were submitted by tlic complainants, but they are so fully answered by the state decisions, that it seems quite unnecessary to enter into argument upon the subject. Unless the state decisions are to be overruled, it is plain that the second and third propositions of the complainants cannot be sustained. In view of the whole case, I am of the opinion that the complainants are not entitled to relief.\nBill of complaint dismissed with costs."},{"case_name":"Catherine Heuser et al. v. Jonathan M. Harris, Executor, etc., et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/5295158\/","date":"1867-01-01","court":"Illinois Supreme Court","content":"Mr. Justice Bkeese\ndelivered the opinion of the Court:\nAbout the 6th of February, 1865, one Henry Seibert, then of Madison county, in this State, departed this life, leaving a will, which was duly proved in the probate court of that county. The will bore date, Madison county, October 4, 1862, the fourth clause of which, after appointing Jonathan M. Harris his \u201cadministrator,\u201d was as follows: \u201cI do request that the administrator shall sell the land at public auction, to the highest bidder, first giving six months\u2019 notice in the Edwards-ville paper and in one Alton paper, on time, as follows, one and two years credit, etc.; this money is to be divided as follows, one-half shall go to the school-district in which the farm lays, and shall be under the control of one person elected by the people of the district, and he shall be elected for four years at one time, and be required to give security for the faithful trust put in his hands, and no one shall receive any per cent for their trouble; this shall be loaned out, and none of it shall be used except the interest, and it for no other purpose than for schooling the children, and the other half shall go to the support of the poor of Madison county, but none of it shall be used but the interest, but first the administrator shall have a reasonable pay out of the proceeds of land for his labor.\u201d\nCatharine Heuser and Mary Schneider, being his sisters, and only relatives nearest of kin to the testator, exhibited their bill in chancery in the Madison Circuit Court against Jonathan M. Harris, to whom letters of administration with the will annexed had been granted, and the directors of school district Ho. \u00e9, town 5, H. B., 6 \"W., qmd the County Court of Madison county, alleging that they were the only heirs at law of the deceased, and claimed that this fourth clause of the will was inoperative and void on account of uncertainty,\u2014that portion of it giving one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the land to the school district in which the farm was situate, in this, that by law the school directors of that district have the care, custody and control of all school money belonging to the district or accruing to the same, and. are the only persons authorized by law to take charge of the same. That the will provides no mode by which the person who is to have control of this fund shall be elected; that, by law, school districts can be changed, and the will provides that the person shall be elected by the people of the district, applying indiscriminately to men, women and children, whether of sufficient understanding to vote or not; and the will further provides that this person, so to be elected, shall give security for the trust, without stating to whom such security shall be given, or the manner in which it is to be given, or the amount thereof, and therefore the provision cannot be executed. And as to that part of the will giving the other half of these proceeds to the support of the poor of Madison county, that is void for uncertainty, and cannot be carried into effect, because the money is not placed in the hands of any person for distribution, nor is there any method or manner prescribed in which it is to be distributed, or in what proportion, nor can it be ascertained to whom the money is to be distributed, as \u201c the poor of Madison county \u201d is a very uncertain and indeterminate term, and no method is provided by the will of ascertaining who are to take the benefits of the bequest.\nThe bill charges that the administrator had no lawful authority to make sale of the land, as the title to it is in them, complainants, as the only heirs at law of the deceased.\nThe prayer is, that this fourth clause of the will be declared null and void, and that the administrator be enjoined from selling the land, and the title thereto be decreed in complainants.\nA general demurrer was put in to this bill, which was sustained by the court, and the bill dismissed.\nTo reverse this decree this appeal is taken, and this decision on the demurrer and dismissing the bill is assigned as error.\nIt is argued by the counsel for appellants that the policy of the law is against bequests of the description made in this will, and the superior equities are in favor of the appellants, they being his sisters and only heirs at law, who should have been the natural objects of his charity, and he says that statutes have been passed in some of the States to prevent such disposition of property.\nThere being no statute in this State prohibiting such bequests, is it not a fair inference the law-making power of this State has not regarded them as impolitic % As to the superior equities of an heir at law over a devisee under a will, we are unable to perceive them. Eo next of kin, no matter how near he may be, can be said to have any equitable right to his kinsman\u2019s estate. The law of the land has placed every person\u2019s estate wholly under the control of the owner, subject to such final disposition of it as he may choose to make by his last will and testament, subject to the statutory rights of his widow, if he leaves one. Ever since the introduction of the practice of making wills it has been universally conceded that the testator may dispose of his property by his own will as he pleases.\nA child has no natural right to the estate of his father: if he has, it is a right which cannot be asserted against the testamentary disposition of the estate by the father. So, in the absence of other relatives near of kin to the owner of an estate, a brother or sister, or parent, might seem to have a right to the estate, and so they would, in all these cases, upon intestacy, for it then becomes a legal, not an equitable right; so that it cannot be asserted, that the nearest of kin has any equity' whatever in the estate of his kinsman. A disposition of it by the owner, by will, or by deed, there being no legal impediment, determines its destiny, and no court in the- world can afford relief, or do, more than sympathize with the disappointed expectant. We have seen no legislation of any State directed against the policy of such bequests, and recollect no judicial decision in that direction. On the contrary, the courts, both in England and in this country, have recognized and upheld such charities, following, in this respect, the civil law, from which the rudiments of the law of charities was undoubtedly derived. It was a fixed maxim in Eoman jurisprudence, that legacies to pious uses, which included all legacies destined for works of piety or charity, whether they related to spiritual or temporal concerns, were entitled to peculiar favor and to be deemed privileged testaments. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 489, \u00a7 1137. By this law, the construction of testaments of this nature was most liberal, and the legacies were never permitted to be lost, either by the uncertainty or failure of the persons or objects for which they were destined. As instances, if a legacy was given to the church, or to the poor generally, without any description of what church or what poor, this law sustained it, by giving it, in the first case, to the parish church of the place where the testator lived; and in the latter case, to the hospital of the same place; and if there was none, then to the poor of the same-parish. Id. \u00a7 1139.\nThese principles of pious legacies under the high authority of the civil law, were readily introduced into the common law of England, anterior to the enactment of 43 Elizabeth, chapter 4, known as the statute of charitable uses, and have been known there and recognized for ages. Prior to this statute, however, devises to charitable uses generally, without imposing a trustee, and devises to a non-existing corporation, or to an unincorporated society, were held utterly void for want of a person capable of taking as devisee. It was to remedy this defect, that this statute was enacted, providing a mode of enforcing such rises hy a- commission under the direction of the Court of Chan- eery (id. \u00a7 1146); but it was soon settled, that the remedy was not confined to the proceeding by commission, but that the Court of Chancery had jurisdiction by original bill. The mode of proceeding by commission has now fallen into disuse, and information in the name of the attorney-general, as an officer of the crown, the King being viewed as the father of the country, and the proceedings instituted for the public good, is now the usual mode.\nA long and uninterrupted course of decisions under this statute shows, most conclusively, that bequests of the nature of those in the will in question have received the unqualified sanction of the English Court of Chancery. They are held to be within the letter and spirit of the statute 43 Elizabeth, chapter 4, for, in the preamble thereto, are enumerated devises \u201c for poor people,\u201d \u201c for schools of learning, free schools and scholars of universities.\u201d\nThe object of this bequest is certain, and so is the recipient, being the school district in which the farm is situate, and that, by law, is a corporation and capable of taking. Here, then, are two of the difficulties suggested by appellants out of the way, and the remaining one is easily removed. That has reference to the appointment of a trustee. It is said by appellants\u2019 counsel, that there is no power to compel the election of a trustee every four years, and therefore the bequest cannot be carried out; that it is provided by the will that this election shall be by the people of the district, which would include both sexes and the children; and that by law the school directors have control of all the school property of the district, and therefore the designation of another person to take control of this bequest, is contrary to the law and to public policy.\nIt may be answered to all this, that there is no power to compel the election of any one to any office. Those possessed of the elective franchise, may exercise it or abstain, as best accords with their views of policy in the particular case. Elections are voluntary, and should the people of the district refuse to elect a trustee, the bequest would not, for that reason, be lost, for it is made to a corporation capable of taking it, and the mere instrument to control its application can be readily provided by a resort to a court of chancery. As to the persons who are to vote, designated in the will as \u201c the people \u201d of the district, that means, simply, such persons as vote at elections. As well remarked by appellees\u2019 counsel, the term must be understood in a political sense, and means those, and only those, with whom the elective power is deposited\u2014those who elect officers of district schools, and we think with him, that, to consider \u201c the people \u201d in any other sense, would do violence to the language.\nBut suppose the will did require an election by the people in the sense in which appellants\u2019 counsel would have that term understood, we do not think that would overturn the bequest, for why should not the whole population in the school district vote for this trustee ? What principle would be violated if they did? We see none.\nIf, however, a trustee should not be elected, the school 'district could apply to chancery to supply one, by giving to the will the most liberal construction, so as not to permit the bequest to be lost. Over this subject the jurisdiction of chancery is unquestionable, the statute 43 Elizabeth, ch. 4, being in force in this State. Scates\u2019 Comp. '720.\nIt is well settled in the English chancery courts, that, where money is given to a charity generally and indefinitely, without trustees or objects selected, the King, as trustee, or parens patriae, will direct a scheme, and where trustees are appointed, the chancellor will direct a scheme for the charity, he having jurisdiction over the trust (Boyle on Charities, 238, 239), and this when neither the trustee nor objects are selected. In this case both the object and the trustee are pointed out, the only real difficulty being the election of the trustee in the mode specified, which, by the argument of appellants, is so utterly impracticable as to defeat the appointment, and leave the fund without any person to control it. Surely, the powers of a court of chancery should extend so far as to supply a trustee to manage a testamentary bequest, and if it be admitted one -could not be elected under this will, a court of chancery, to carry out the intention of the testator, would, by a liberal intendment, appoint one. Every reasonable act will be done, and the most liberal construction of the will had, by a court of chancery, to aid the beneficiaries, when the intention is plain and undeniable. Hadley v. Hopkin\u2019s Academy, 14 Pick. 240.\nBut, without reference to 43 Elizabeth, we think that the innate, inherent jurisdiction of a court of chancery is fully competent to supply defects of this nature. The cases referred to by the counsel for appellees are numerous, and to the point. One, and it may be called a leading case, is the case of Fidal v. Girard, 2 How. (U. S.) 127. There it was held that donations for the establishment of colleges, schools and seminaries of learning, and especially such as are for the education of orphans and poor scholars, are charities, in the sense of the common law, and that under the statute 43 Elizabeth, chapter 4, such charity is not void because the beneficiaries thereof are uncertain and indefinite, and a court of equity has jurisdiction to enforce the charity for their benefit, and the right of the beneficiaries to have it enforced is not affected by the fact that no court had existed in Pennsylvania having equity powers or with jurisdiction to enforce such trusts.\nThis seems an answer to the argument of appellants, that school districts are subject to change by the legislature, and as the bequest was to the school district, as then established, the then inhabitants of the district were in the contemplation of the testator, as the beneficiaries, whereas, by a change of the district, some of them may be located outside of it and cannot avail of it. But the farm, notwithstanding, will be in some school district, and its inhabitants be the beneficiaries. The school district where the farm lies, is a never-dying donee, and it is quite immaterial who people it; the object of the testator\u2019s bounty will be fully attained. The mere fact, that the beneficiaries may change, can be no reason why the donees should not take the bequest, if the object of the gift can be substantially reached. Such a\ncharity as this is favored in the law, and will receive a more liberal construction than will be allowed in gifts to individuals. For instance, if a testator gives his property to such person as he shall\" name to be his executor, and he appoints no executor, or if one is appointed and he dies before the testator, and no other is appointed in his stead, the testator will be held intestate, and the next of kin will take the estate; but, if a like bequest be given to the executor in favor of a charity, the court of chancery will, in both instances, supply the place of an executor and carry into effect that very bequest, which, in the case of individuals, must have failed altogether. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1165, 512, referring to Mills v. Farmer, 1 Merivale, 55, 96; Moggridge v. Thackwell, 7 Vesey, 36. So, if an estate is devised to such person as the executor shall name, and no executor is appointed, or, if one being appointed, dies in the life of the testator and no other is appointed in his place, the bequest becomes a mere nullity; yet such a bequest, if for a charity, would be good, and the court of chancery would, in such case, assume the office of executor and execute it. Id. 1166, referring to the same cases, supra, and to Attorney General v. Jackson, 11 Vesey, 365, 367.\nIn carrying into execution a bequest to an individual, the mode in which the legacy is to take effect is deemed to be of the substance of the legacy; but, when the legacy is to charity, the court of chancery will consider charity as the substance, and in such cases, if the mode pointed out fail, it will provide another mode by which the charity may take effect. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1167, referring to the cases above cited and to Attorney General v. Berryman, 1 Dick. 168; Denyer v. Durce, 1 Tam. 32; 2 Roper on Legacies, 175 to 181; Attorney General v. Iron Monger's Company, 1 Craig & Phillips, 208; 222, 225; Same case in 2 Beav. 313; Attorney General v. The Cooper's Company, 3 id. 29; Same v. The Draper's Company. 2 id. 508. And another principle well established is, that, if the bequest be for charity, it matters not \u2022 how uncertain the persons or the objects may be, or whether the persons who are to take are in-esse or not, or whether the legatee be a corporation capable-by law of taking or not; or whether the bequst can be carried into exact execution or not; for, in all these and the like cases, the court will sustain the legacy and give it effect according to its own principles, and where a literal execution becomes inexpedient or impracticable the court will execute it as nearly as it can according to the original purpose or cy pres. Id. \u00a7 1169.\nThe opinions in the cases of Moggridge v. Thackwell, 7 Ves. and Mills v. Farmer, 1 Merivale, were by Lord Eldom, and result in this, that, if a testator has manifested a general intention to give to charity, the failure of the particular mode by which the charity is to be effected will not destroy the charity, for, the substantial intention being charity, equity 'will substitute another mode of devoting the property to charitable purposes, although the formal intention, as to the mode, cannot be accomplished.\nSo, here, if the election of a trustee be impracticable, \u2014 if all the machinery prepared by the testator cannot be put in working order, still the object of his bounty must not be defeated on that account. A court of equity will execute it cy pres, or as near to the intention of the testator as it can, to effect the purpose.\nThe counsel for appellants claim that the court will not under the cy pres power make a disposition of this property different from that proposed by the testator. But the authorities cited show, if the mode the testator has designated is impracticable, and counsel insist it is, then the court can and will substitute another mode, cy pres, or as near the one designated as may be practicable.\nThe object of the bequest cannot be changed. As this court \u2018 said in Gilman et al. v. Blackburn et al., 16 Ill. 225, and referred to by appellants\u2019 counsel, the intention of the donor of a charity will control unless that is impracticable, in which case it may be altered cy pres, and that charities are administered by the courts on cy pres principles for the very purpose of sustaining and carrying into effect the intention; but they cannot change the object or place because the fund could be more judiciously and efficiently applied in another place, or to a different object. This doctrine of cy pres has no place in lega cies to individuals, but, in a charity like this, there is reason and good sense in presuming, that, had the testator known the election of a trustee, in the mode he proposed, his executing bond, and to serve as such gratuitously, he would have adopted another mode, and the court must act as he himself would have done, and this is the foundation of the doctrine ay pres. An approximation to the intention of the testator, as near as possible, is all that is meant by this doctrine. And when the object is so plainly manifested, great latitude would be allowed in the selection of a trustee, or in a mode by which the intention can be carried into full effect. This would seem to be a matter by no means difficult, but it is not for this court to suggest it.\nThe counsel for appellants insists, that the bequest to \u201c the poor of Madison county \u201d is so general and vague, that it cannot be carried into effect. It is urged, that, as the will makes no appointment of trustees, or provides in any way who shall have the management of this portion of the proceeds of the farm, the court cannot execute the trust on the ey pres principle.\n~We think the principles above stated, and the cases referred to, fully settle this branch of the case.\nThat the term, \u201c the poor of Madison county,\u201d is vague, having no definite meaning, it is so, in the sense in which apellants\u2019 counsel presents it. The poor of a county are, in legal contemplation, understood to be those who are dependent upon public charity ; in other words, they are the paupers who are maintained by taxes levied on the people, or by the income from the public property. They are under the care and supervision, in some counties, of the County Courts, and in other counties, of the board of supervisors of the county, either of which is capable of taking a bequest of this kind as a trustee. And so must the counsel for appellant supposed when he drafted complainants\u2019 bill, as the County Court is made one of the defendants to the bill, on the only hypothesis, as we suppose, they might claim as donees of one moiety of the proceeds . of the sale of the farm, and in this he did not err.\nThe counsel for appellees has referred to some cases where bequests of this character have been sustained. The State v. Girard, 2 Iredell Ch. (N. C.) 210, where the devise was of lands and stock to the poor of Beaufort county, and Witman v. Lex, 17 Serg. and Rawle, 88.\nIn \u00a7 1139 of 2 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, before cited, a bequest to the poor, without any description of what poor, will go to the hospital of the place where the testator resided, and if there be none there, to the poor of the same parish. But here the bequest is made to the poor of Madison county, and the legal guardians of that poor, namely, the County Court, can administer the fund. They are a corporation, and capable of taking by deed or will, so that there can be no necessity here of resorting to th\u00bf doctrine of cy yores. The court of chancery would not dismiss a bill filed by that court for the purpose of getting possession of this fund, however insignificant it may be, or how unavailing to satisfy the wants of those whose condition excites so much commiseration, and which prompted the munificence of this benevolent testator.\nThe views we have here expressed dispose of the objections made by appellants to both of these bequests. We entertain no doubt, if the election of a trustee, and his qualification are impracticable, a court of chancery, on a proper application, would remodel the will in this regard, ey fres, as near as possible to effectuate the design of the testator.\nAs to the bequest to the poor of Madison county, we are of opinion, for the reasons given, and on authority, that the paupers of the county were meant by that term, and that the County Court of that county is a proper donee of the fund, and they can take it and control it as the trustee of the poor, in the mode prescribed by the will.\nThe decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill is affirmed.\nDecree affirmed."},{"case_name":"James R. Davis and Others\u2019 Lessee vs. Andrew Helbig","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1762339\/","date":"1867-07-15","court":"Court of Appeals of Maryland","content":"Crabs', J.,\ndelivered the opinion of this Court.\nTwo questions present themselves for the consideration of the Court on this appeal. First: Whether the Act of the legislature, passed at December session, 1845, chap. 253, entitled, \u201c An Act for the relief of John L. Hook and others, devisees of James Hook, late of Allegany county, deceased,\u201d was aproper exercise of legislative power ; and, secondly, if so, whether the power conferred by the Act on the County Court of Allegany gave that Court jurisdiction, and authorized the decree, by virtue of which the property in controversy was purchased. The three sections of the Act very clearly designate the reason and object of its enactment; the authority granted by the Act was two-fold : to effect a valid division of the real estate among the devisees of James Hook, on their application for that purpose, at that time depending in the Court, and also to transmute the share of the real estate to be allotted to Mrs. Davis and her children into personal property of money, provided the Court was satisfied it would he beneficial to all who were interested. The Acts of the legislature are presumed to he constitutional, and it is only when they manifestly infringe some of the provisions of the Constitution, or violate the vested rights of the people, that their effect and operation can he impeded hy judicial power ; for the Act of a legislature is not pronounced unconstitutional or invalid in a doubtful case. The power to decree the sale of real estate of minors in special cases, was frequently exercised hy the legislature of this State, and the power thus exercised was never successfully doubted or questioned hy the profession or the Courts. See 11 Gill & Johnson, 81. The increasing necessity of these special Acts caused, the legislature to enact the statutes of 1816, chapter 139;, and 1818, chapter 133. These Acts conferred general powers on the Courts to decree sales of the real estates of infants, provided they were satisfied it would he for the interest and benefit of the minors. The constitutional right of the legislature to pass these special and general laws was conceded, as the State was considered the general guardian and protector of minors who were disabled to act for themselves, and the legislature, exercising this tutelary power over the persons and property of infants, claimed and exercised the right to provide hy public or private Acts for converting real estate in which they had vested or contingent interests, into personal property and securities, when necessary for their benefit.\nIt was contended hy one of the counsel for the appellants, that in virtue of the 21st section of the Bill of Rights, the legislature was prohibited from passing this Act, as hy that section \u201c no freeman ought to he deprived of his property, without the judgment of his peers, of hy the law of the land.\u201d Surely this Act cannot he consid ered repugnant to that clause in the Bill of Rights; it did not propose to deprive the minors of their property, but was passed on the application of their father, representing that a sale of the property would be beneficial to the children and promotive of their interest, and it was therefore, we think, a just and proper subject for the exercise of the authority of the legislature as parens patriae. The commuting of realty into personalty has never been held as depriving the children of their property ; by the exercise of such a power, minor children are enabled to derive subsistence, comfort and education from their property, which otherwise might be wholly useless and unproductive, and this power is asserted by Justice Grier, in delivering the opinion of the Court, in the case of Florentine vs. Barton, 2 Wallace, 210, where he says, \u201c Statutes are found in almost every State in the Union, giving authority to guardians to sell the estates of their wards, subject to the supervision and approbation of a Court, and the power to grant such special authority to guardians has been generally admitted.\u201d This is not like the case of Crane vs. Meginnis, 1 Gill & Johns., 463. In that case the legislature undertook to appropriate the money of Meginnis to Crane, and it was therefore an exercise by the legislature of judicial power, and repugnant to the Constitution. It was an attempt on the part of the legislative department of the government to encroach on a co-ordinate department, and for that reason the third section of the Act in that case was declared hy the Court a nullity. Now, can it be said that this Act of Assembly has deprived any man of his property, or applied it to any other use than that of the children ? The sale of the property was in virtue of the exercise of the power vested in the legislative department, and which was not prescribed by the Federal or State Constitution. The views which we have expressed in this opinion of the constitutional power of the legislature to pass this Act, are fully sustained by adjudged cases of our sister States. In 16 Massa., 326, it was decided that \u201cthe legislature have power to license the sale of the real estate of minors, notwithstanding they have delegated the same power to the judicial Courts.\u201d In 19 New York, 463, Allen Justice, said, \u201cThe Courts have established this power by judicial decisions; and I think the legislature also had the power to direct as it did by the Act in question, a sale of the premises, so as to bind the interest of any posthumous children of the daughters, who on their birth w.ould become interested in the remainder created in the will.\u201d And in 2 Barr, 277, Chief Justice Gibson, commenting on the same question, says, \u201c The Act is constitutional, and the Court will enforce a contract of purchase from the trustees.\u201d Was the jurisdiction by this Act conferred on the County Court of Allegany to decree a sale of the property in controversy ? The adult heirs of James Hook under the will had filed their bill for a division of the real estate among his devisees, when they applied for this special Act, to enable them to make the division valid, not only against the children in esse of Matilda Jane Davis, the tenant for life, but also against the after born children. We are satisfied, looking at the three sections of the Act, that it was the manifest intention of the law, that the whole interest of Matilda Jane Davis and her children in this property, was to be considered and acted upon by the Court, for by the Act the Court was authorized in their discretion to order and direct such amendments or modifications of the bill or other proceedings as they deemed necessary and proper to \u2019 carry into effect the provisions of the Act. It is one entire Act, and* the provisions are not limited to the first and second sections, but are equally applicable to the third section. All the parties interested in the property were before the Court, and after the ratification of the division among the devisees, the petition for the sale of the por tion alloted to Matilda Jane Davis and her children was filed in pursuance and by authority of the third section of the Act. According to the just construction of this Act, no power was conferred on the Court to decree a sale of this property unless they were satisfied by proof, that it would be advantageous to the infants. The Court expressly state in their decree, that it is based on the Act of Assembly and the affidavits filed in the proceedings; and the money arising from the sales was ordered to be brought into Court to be invested or otherwise disposed of under the direction of the Court. So that every safeguard was observed by the Court to protect the interest of the children. The legislature, having the right to pass the law, also directed how the act should be done; and the whole proceeding was under the special Act, and independent of the general Acts on the subject, and not to be controlled or governed by them; and the only question to be adjudicated by the Court was, whether the interests of the minors would be advanced by the sale. But it was contended by the counsel for the appellants that the Act and petition did not make a case of jurisdiction in the Court. It is said, in 5 Gill, 256, that the true test of jurisdiction will, in all cases, be found on the determination of the question, whether a demurrer will not lie to a bill? Tried by this test, we are of opinion that the Court would have determined that the Act conferred jurisdiction as \u201c the power to hear and determine a cause is jurisdiction ; it is coram judice, whenever a case is presented, which brings this power into action.\u201d United States vs. Arredondo and others, 6 Peters, 709. Admitting the jurisdiction, a decree without proof, or upon insufficient proof, is one in the exercise of jurisdiction, and can only be the subject of appeal or review. As this Court said in 4 Gill, 122, \u201c they are irregularities and errors which could only be taken advantage of by the party aggrieved by them, on a re-hear ing, a bill of review, or an appeal in tbe cause in which they are found.\u201d A Court cannot examine into the merits of a decree collaterally, if it had jurisdiction ; and in 12 Gill & John., 338, a record was admitted in evidence of the sale of infants\u2019 lands under a decree, although there was no evidence to prove the allegations, except the answer of the guardian of the infants. And in 6 Gill & John., 1 and 111, it was held that the answer of the guardian of an infant is not evidence against him. The appellee in this case claims'under a judicial sale, and the soundest principles of justice and policy seem to demand that every reasonable intendment should be made to support the titles of bona fide purchasers of real property, and Courts of justice are not disposed to impair their safety by insisting on matters of form; they can only be avoided for substantial legal defects. These principles of the law, applicable to judicial sales, have been frequently recognized and adopted by this Court, and in the case of Eliott and Wife\u2019s Lessee vs. Knott, 14 Md. Rep., 121, it was ruled that an execution and sale of the real estate of a defendant in a judgment was valid against his infant child, although the defendant was dead on the day the fi. fa. was tested and issued, and this judgment of the Court was predicated on the case of Jackson vs. Robins, 16 Johnson, 582, which approved of the principle enforced by .Lord Chancellor Redesdale in the case of Bennett vs. Hammell, 2 Sch. & Lef., 566 ; in that case the Chancellor .said \u201c that there were irregularities in the proceedings, which he pointed out, and that the decree was erroneous, \u2019inasmuch as the infant ought to have a day to show cause against the decree when he comes of age. But he held that this was.not to affect the purchaser\u2019s title. It would be too much, he thought, to say that a purchaser under a decree of that description could be bound to look into all these circumstances, and to go through all the proceedings, from the beginning to the end.\u201d Chief Justice Le Grand, after quoting this opinion, with approbation, adds, \u201cthat Courts of justice guard and maintain with jealous vigilance, the titles of purchasers acquired under judicial sales.\u201d\n(Decided 15th July, 1867.)\nEor these reasons we are of opinion that the prayers of the appellants were properly rejected by the Court below, and concur with the Court in the prayer granted at the instance of the defendant, and therefore affirm the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed."},{"case_name":"The People ex rel. Dennis Graufield vs. George W. Perkins, Superintendent of the Reform School","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4794176\/","date":"1868-01-01","court":"Illinois Circuit Court","content":"McAllister, J.:\u2014\nThe writ of habeas corpus was allowed in this case for the purpose of inquiring into an alleged illegal imprisonment of one Dennis G-raufield, a boy a little over fourteen years of age, and who has been confined since the 20th of July, 1866, in the reform school of the city of Chicago. The writ was served on the superintendent at the reform school, and he admitted due service. He appeared, however, by the city attorney, who moved to quash the writ on two grounds, viz:\n1. The reform school being beyond the city limits, the court has no jurisdiction.\n2. The statute, defining the powers of the court, requires ten days\u2019 notice of the application of the writ.\nHe also moved that the ease be transferred to the superior court of Chicago.\nNeither of the grounds stated for the motion to quash is tenable.\nFirst, then, as to jurisdiction: The recorder\u2019s court is a city court; and whatever locality the corporation holds, in its character of land proprietor, and governs by its common council, is within the territorial jurisdiction of this court. The institution in question is called \u201cThe Reform School of the City of Chicago.\u201d The site upon which it stands was, pursuant to authority, given by the legislature, selected and purchased, and is held by the city for that purpose; and the institution, by the same authority, was committed to the full control of the city. This locality is as much a part of the city as any portion of Lake street is; and a crime committed there, if otherwise cognizable by this court, would be as \u25a0clearly within its jurisdiction as if committed in the armory.\nSecondly. As to the ten days\u2019 notice: If the position of the city attorney is correct, then, when a person in jail is ready to give bail in eases pending in this court, and desires a writ of habeas corpus for that purpose, he must give the sheriff ten days\u2019 notice, lie' in jail until the time expires, and then the sheriff may, by filing a request, as is done in this case, have the application transferred to another court. The act creating this court clearly gives it power to issue the writ of habeas corpu-s, the same as the circuit court may. The subsequent act relied on declares that \u201cNeither the said recorder\u2019s court, nor the judge thereof, shall grant any writ of ne exeat, injunction, or other writ or process, which said court or judge shall have power to issue in civil eases, excepting original writs of summons, capias, attachment, etc., unless the person against whom such writ is granted shall have ten days\u2019 notice,\u201d etc.\nIt is a familiar rule of construction that, when certain things are specified in a statute, and followed by general words, as in this case, \u201cother writ or process,\u201d nothing will be included under the general words except what belongs to the same class as those specified. The writs that are here specified are such as are auxiliary to the original process and proceedings. The writ of habeas corpus is not auxiliary to any other writ; but is the original summons. The writ of habeas corpus, like the common-law certiorari, is one of right and will never be deemed taken away by implication. The motion to quash the writ, and transfer the ease to the superior court must be overruled.\nWe must, then, meet the questions involved on the merits -of the case, viz: Was the boy Dennis Graufield illegally committed to the reform school, and is he there illegally detained? The evidence in the case shows that at the time of his capture he had and still has both father and mother living in this city. His father was and is in good circum\u2022stances, worth, as he states, between $10,000 and $15,000; had a good and respectable home, at which the boy lived, -and had as good parental care as a majority of children in the city. He was not accused, indicted, or convicted of any \u00abcrime, but was brought before Judge Jameson of the superior court, acting as commissioner under the reform school act, and, by his order, committed to the reform school, and that commitment is the only legal cause for his caption and -detention relied upon. The city attorney strenuously insists that this commitment is final and conclusive upon the whole world. If this be true, there exists among us a power -of the most dangerous and alarming character. This boy\u2019s parents were well settled and known citizens of the city. 'They were able and willing to take care of him, yet he was seized, and, without their knowledge, taken to the reform school, as it is called, wherein the superintendent claims the right to detain him until he is twenty-one years of age. So, in the same way, by the exercise of this power and its easy abuse, the little boy, of the tenderest of parents, may be seized whenever he has reached the age of six years and a day, and be sent to the same supposed reform school, and there detained in spite of the tears and waihngs of his parents until he is twenty-one. There is no appeal from the decision of the judge, and no writ of error will lie. Even the governor cannot release by pardon, because there is no offense to pardon. The only possible avenue of relief would be through the discretionary action of the board of guardians, which may be composed of men jealous of power or fond of it. Are the free-born subjects of this state, really, by the law of the land, to be placed in a position where, being themselves wholly innocent of crime, and their children likewise innocent, they are to be forced to beg on their knees, before some board, for the privilege of enjoying the custody and society of their own children? These are grave questions, and from the cases that have come before this court may well be asked at every fireside. I propose now to analyze this claim of power, and see whether it have legally any foundation or not.\nThe father who, by law, is entitled to the custody and earnings of his child during his minority, comes and claims that custody. The respondent says no. By a legal proceeding you have been divested of that right, and it has been vested in me, and shows the commitment of a judge of the superior court to establish his position. If the statute under which this proceeding was had has any validity, it is one not according to the course of the common law or any regular proceedings in the courts. It is a special proceeding. The judge does not act as a court; but as an officer with special and limited jurisdiction, in which case there is no presumption in favor of jurisdiction, but compliance with every provision of the statute essential to jurisdiction must be shown. The eighth section of the original act requires the commissioner to issue a summons or notice to the father of the boy, if living and resident in the city, to appear before him at such time and place as he shall in such summons or notice appoint; and to show cause, if any there be, why the said boy shall not be committed to the reform school. And upon appearance before him of the party named in said summons or order, or if, after due service had of the summons or order, there shall be no such appearance, the said commissioner shall, upon expiration of the time named in said summons or order for said appearance, proceed to examine said boy, etc. Municipal laws, pp. 132, 133. By the fourth section of the act of 1867, in reference to the reform school, the powers and duties of the commissioner are conferred upon the judges of the superior and circuit courts.\nBefore the judge has jurisdiction to proceed and examine the boy, the summons or notice mentioned must be served upon the father, if a resident of the city, and, in the absence thereof, the judge has no more power or authority to commit than the mayor would have.\nThe records of the superior court in this case were produced, and no summons or notice appears; none is recited, nor is it claimed that an)\u201d- of the papers are lost. There is upon this point something rather singular. It is not probable that a judge of the high character of Judge Jameson would proceed to commit without he supposed he had complied with the statute in this particular. And, it is quite probable from all that does appear, that he was imposed upon by somebody. The parents swear most explicitly that they, neither of them, had any notice. The respondent says in his return: \u201cI further return that said judge of the superior court of Chicago did issue the summons required by the provisions of said acts, and caused the same to be served prior to the examination of said boy.\u201d\nServed upon whom? If it is known upon whom served, why not say upon whom ? It certainly was not the father of the boy. This return and the absence of the pretended summons, together with the fact that the father was not served, gives rise to the suspicion that somebody falsely personated the father, and thus imposed upon the judge. At all events, the want of service defeats the jurisdiction of the officer and renders the commitment void. Burdick v. Blook, 1 Hill (N. Y.) 130, and cases there cited.\nBut could this commitment be upheld, even if every provision of the statute had been complied with? The nature and character of this so-called reform school have been fully investigated in this court upon the testimony of the assistant superintendent himself, and other evidence. It is called by the pleasant name of school; but is in reality a prison. It is just as essentially a prison as the state prison at Joliet. The inmates are subject to a coercive system of labor, for the benefit of the institution or superintendent; and it is as rigidly enforced as at the state penitentiary. As a prison for juvenile offenders, who have been indicted and convicted, it is far preferable to the jail or bridewell. But I deny the authority of any man, or set of men to seize boys who are innocent of crime, and hold them in prison subject to involuntary servitude. The worst burglar in the state can be \u25a0sent to the state penitentiary for only fourteen years; and yet by this system, a child who has attained the age of six years and one day may he seized and imprisoned like the burglar, subject to the same system of hard labor for fifteen years, although as innocent as when his eyes first saw the light of heaven.\nIf such a power exist whence is it derived? The learned \u25a0counsel for the respondent says: From the state as parens patries.\nBefore and at the time of American independence, the sovereigns of England claimed and exercised many prerogatives as parent of the country. Through his court of chancery he appointed guardians for infants and committees for the custody of idiots and lunatics. \u201cThe king as parens patries has the general superintendence of all charities; which he exercises by the keeper of his conscience, the chancellor.'\"\u2019 3 Bl. Com. 428. In Wheeler v. Smith, 9 How. (U. S.) 55, 78, the supreme court of the United States, McLean, Justice says: \u201cWhen this country achieved its independence, the prerogatives of the crown devolved upon the people of the states. And this power still remains with them, except so far as they have delegated a portion of it to the federal government. The sovereign will is made known to us by legislative enactment, and to this we must look in our judicial action instead of the prerogatives of the crown. The state as a sovereign is the parens patries.\u201d\nThe sovereign will is made known to us by legislative enactments. But it is also expressed by the constitution, which contains many limitations by which the legislative power is \u25a0controlled. Never since the days of the Magna Charta was it lawful for the sovereign of England, as parens patries, to keep infants innocent of crime, imprisoned during their minority. And in this state the power extends only to the placing of others, under circumstances, in the place of parent with the same limited authority. A parent may use moderate chastisement; have custody and control of his children ; hut he cannot keep them in continuous imprisonment.' \u201cWhen necessary to the discharge of parental duty he may resort to corporal discipline. He may impose such tempo rary confinement as may be necessary to secure obedience to his reasonable commands, so that it is not prejudicial to the life, limb, or health of the child.\u201d Hurd on Habeas Corpus, 43. Again, on page 45, the same author says:1 \u2018 Temporary confinement is allowed as a means of enforcing obedience to reasonable commands. But this power must also be \u25a0exercised with moderation.\u201d Such temporary confinement would not probably be deemed imprisonment within the inhibition of the constitution. Section 8 of article 13 of the \u2022constitution of this state declares: \u201cThat no freeman shall be imprisoned or disseized of his freehold liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty, or property but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be received,\u201d says Kent, \u201cas a proposition universally understood and acknowledged throughout this \u25a0country, that no person can be taken or imprisoned; or dis-seized of his freehold or estate; or exiled or condemned; or deprived of life, liberty or property, unless by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers. The words \u2018law of the land,\u2019 as used originally in Magna Charta, in reference to this subject, are understood to mean due process of law, that is, by indictment or presentment of good and lawful men; and this, says Lord Coke, is the true sense and exposition of those words. The better and larger definition of due process of law is, that it means law in its regular course of administration, through courts of justice.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 13; Story\u2019s Com. on Constitution, vol. 3, 661; Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill (N. Y.) 140, 146. \u201cThe law of the land, in the bill of rights,\u201d s\u00e1ys Chief Justice Ruffin in an elaborate opinion delivered in Hoke v. Henderson, 4 Dev. (N. C.) 15, \u201cdoes not mean merely an act of the legislature, for that \u25a0construction would abrogate all restriction upon legislative .authority. The clause means that statutes which would deprive a citizen of the rights of persons or property without a regular trial according to the course and usage of the common law, would not be the law of the land in the sense of the constitution.\u201d\nThat the statute in question, which purports to authorize others to seize a boy and confine him in prison for so many years, and compel him to labor for their benefit, without even an accusation of crime against him, is just such a statute as the principles of the bill of rights make void, there can be no doubt. 1 \u2018 There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in this state except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,\u201d says the constitution, yet there is a system of involuntary servitude rigidly enforced in this institution upon those who have committed no crime, or been subject to any accusation, enforced, too, by all the powers incident to close imprisonment. Nothing but the audacity of corporate power could complacently insist upon carrying out such a statute against innocent boys. \u201cIt requires,\u201d says the great luminary of American law, \u201cmore than ordinary hardiness and audacity of character to trample down principles which our ancestors cultivated with reverence; which we imbibed in our early education \u2022 which recommend themselves to the judgment of the world by their truth and simplicity; and which are constantly placed before the eyes of the people, accompanied with the imposing force and solemnity of a constitutional sanction. Bills of right are part of the muniments of freemen showing their title to protection, and they become of increased value when placed under the protection of an independent judiciary, instituted as the appropriate guardian of private rights.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 8.\nIt is considered by the court that Dennis Graufield is unlawfully imprisoned in the reform school of the city of Chicago, and accordingly ordered that he be forthwith discharged therefrom.\nNOTE.\nIn People ex rel. O\u2019Connell v. Turner, Superintendent, 55 Ill. 280, the supreme court held the same law unconstitutional on reasoning similar to that of Judge McAllister in the principal case.\nIn re Petition of Ferrier, 103 Ill. 367, it was held that the act of 1879, establishing industrial schools for girls who lacked proper parental care, were dependent upon the community for support or were surrounded by vicious influences, was constitutional. The court puts its decision on the ground that the institution created by the statute is in fact a school and not a prison and that the state under the act is only assuming its character of parens patriae in cases where the parents of the girl are incapable guardians of the child\u2019s welfare.\nThe industrial school act of 1879, was again held to be constitutional and no infringement of the right of personal liberty in County of McClain v. Humphreys, 104 Ill. 378.\nIn People ex rel. Schwarts v. McLain, the supreme court of Illinois had before it the question of the constitutionality of the Juvenile Court Act of 1899, and an opinion was rendered therein on December 20, 1905. A petition for a rehearing was subsequently filed but while under consideration, the case itself was dismissed and the opinion of December 20, 1905, withdrawn. The opinion although not binding as a precedent is nevertheless of considerable interest, and for that reason it is here reprinted in connection with the above decision. The court in its opinon holds:\n1. That a commitment of a boy to a state institution on the sole ground that he has been guilty of a misdemeanor in proceedings to which the parents are not parties, deprives the parents of the right to pursue happiness and of their rights in the boy\u2019s services, without due process of law.\n2. Mere violation of law cannot constitute delinquency where there is no such unfitness on the part of the parents to care for the boy as gives the state the right to substitute its care for that of the parents.\n3. That the provision for a trial by a jury of six is not unconstitutional since the proceeding is not criminal in its nature, the commitment being to an actual school wherein the state truly assumes the character of parens patriae and not to a prison wherein the boy is really held and punished as for crime. \u2014 Ed.\nPeople ex rel. Schwartz v. McLain.\nOriginal petition for habeas corpus by the people, on the relation of Joseph Schwartz, against Nelson W. McLain. Writ granted.\nLouis Brandes, for relator. Peck, Miller & Starr and Pence & Carpenter (Merritt Starr and George A. Carpenter, of counsel), for respondent.\nBoggs, J. This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed originally in this court. The petition avers that Samuel Schwartz, a son of the petitioner, of the age of 14 years, is unlawfully restrained of his liberty by the respondent, Nelson W. McLain, in his official capacity of superintendent of the St. Charles Home for Boys. It appears from the pleadings on which the cause has been submitted for decision that the relator, Joseph Schwartz, is a resident, and on the 20th day of June, 1905, was a resident of the city of Chicago; that he was the head of a family consisting of himself, his wife, Rachel, and their son, Samuel; that he (the relator) provided his wife and said Samuel, his son, with a comfortable, quiet and orderly home, and maintained and supplied them with food and clothing, and supplied said Samuel with books and stationery, etc., and caused him to attend the public schools, and that relator in all respects performed and discharged his duties as parent toward said Samuel, and that he (the relator) is a reputable and law-abiding citizen, and that the parents of said Samuel have not been guilty of any act inconsistent with the correct and moral control and custody of their son; that on that day a complaint or petition was filed in the circuit court of Cook county, on the chancery side thereof, charging said Samuel with two violations of the provisions of section 55 of the Criminal Code of the state, in that he made \u201crepeated indecent assaults upon Jennie Coliff and other repeated and indecent assaults upon one Fanny Cohen, all within the past two months and in the city of Chicago, county of Cook, and state of Illinois; that the said Jennie Coliff and said Fanny Cohen were then and there at the time of said assaults, and each of them was, a female child under the age of 14 years; that the said Jennie Coliff then and there resided at 72 Wilson street, in said city of Chicago, county of Cook, and state of Illinois; that said Fanny Cohen then and there resided at 88 Wilson street, in said city of Chicago, Cook county, 111.; that said assaults were, and each of them was, publicly committed in the rear of 92 Wilson street, in said city of Chicago, Cook county, 111., and said assaults were, and each of them was, an act of disorderly conduct and a notorious act of public indecency tending to debauch the public morals; \u201d that subsequently, in pursuance of proceedings in the said circuit court under said petition, a decree was entered finding said Samuel guilty of the acts of disorderly conduct and of public indecency tending to debauch the public morals, charged against him and in violation of said section 55 of the Criminal Code, and declaring said Samuel to be a ward of said court, and ordering that he be committed to the St. Charles Home for Boys, there to remain until he should arrive at the age of 21 years, unless sooner discharged according to law; and that the respondent restrains said Samuel in said home for boys in virtue of this order of the court.\nIt appears from the transcript of the proceedings that the order that the boy Samuel should be taken from the custody of the relator, his father, was not on the ground that the relator had in any way failed to provide or care for the said Samuel, or had neglected to exercise proper restraint over him, or that his habits or conduct were injurious to the moral or physical interests of the boy, but solely on the ground the boy had, by disoderly conduct and the acts of- public indecency before mentioned, violated section 55 of the Criminal Code. The relator and his wife, Rachel, the mother of the boy, were cited to bring Samuel, the son, before the court to answer the charges of disorderly conduct and acts of public indecency, but were not made parties to the proceeding, nor were there before said court any charges of the omission of parental duty and care preferred against them, nor did the order entered by the court proceed on the theory the relator or his wife, Rachel, had, by any parental delinquencies, lost the right to keep their son in their family and rear their boy and enjoy his society and receive the benefits of his labor and services. The decree that the boy shall be the ward of the court and should be taken from his home and the custody and care of his parents was based solely on the ground that the boy had committed the misdemeanors aforesaid in violation of the provisions of said section 55 of the Criminal Code, the violation whereof said section 55 provides shall be punished by the infliction of a fine in any sum not exceeding $200 for each offense.\nThe proceeding in the circuit court, which resulted in the decree committing the said Samuel Schwartz to the St. Charles Home for Boys, was in pursuance of one of the provisions of the act of the General Assembly entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the treatment and. control of dependent, neglected and delinquent children,\u201d in force July 1, 1899. 4 Starr & C. Ann. St. Supp. 1902 p. 375. In order to accomplish the purposes indicated in the title, the act provides that a petition in writing, verified by affidavit, may be filed in the circuit or county court, setting forth facts showing that a child in the county is either neglected and dependent or delinquent, and praying for proceedings to be had and taken under said petition for the disposition of such child as shall be found to be neglected and dependent or delinquent. Section 1 of the act defines a delinquent child as follows: \u201cThe words \u2018delinquent child\u2019 shall include any child under the age of sixteen (16) years who violates any law of this state or any city or village ordinance; or who is incorrigible; or who knowingly associates with thieves, vicious or immoral persons; or who is growing up in idleness or crime; or who knowingly frequents a house of ill-fame; or who knowingly patronizes any policy shop or place where any gaming device is or shall be operated.\u201d Section 9 of the act purports to authorize the court to commit any child so found to be delinquent, if a boy, to a training school for boys, or to \u201cany institution within the county, incorporated under the laws in this state that may care for delinquent children, * * * or to any state institution which may he established tor the care of delinquent hoys.\u201d It was in virtue of this provision of the said act that the said Samuel Schwartz was ordered by the circuit court of Cook county, to be taken from the custody of the relator, his father, and committed to the care of the respondent, as the superintendent of the St. Charles Home for Boys, on the ground that the boy had violated, in the manner hereinbefore related, the provisions of said section 55 of the Criminal Code, and had thereby become deemed to be a delinquent boy, within the meaning of said statute.\nIf this enactment is effective and capable of being enforced as against the relator, father of the boy, it must be upon the theory that it is within the power of the state to seize any child under the age of 16 years who has committed a misdemeanor punishable under the Criminal Code of the state by fine, or who has violated an ordinance of any city or village of the state, and take him from his \u25a0home and from the custody of his father and the care of his mother and commit him to a state institution which may be established for the care of delinquent boys, and there keep and train and raise him, though the father may have always provided a comfortable, quiet, orderly, and moral home for him, and have supplied him with school facilities, had not neglected his moral training, and had been and was still ready to render to him all of the duties of a parent. We do not think it is within the power of the General Assembly to thus infringe upon parental rights. At the common law and at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1870, the father possessed the legal right to the care, custody, and control of his minor children, and was entitled'to the services and earnings of such children. These parental rights cast upon the father, as a corresponding obligation, the duty to maintain, support, and educate the children, and to treat them with kindness and affection. Section 1 of the Bill of Rights (Const. 1870, art. 2, \u00a7 1) guaranties protection to the inherent and inalienable rights of men, among these rights being \u201cthe pursuit of happiness; \u201d and section 2 of the same article of the Constitution protects the parent against the destruction of his property rights in the services of his child without due process of law.\nThe right of the parent to the care and custody of the child has its foundation in the love and affection which nature has implanted in the heart of the father for his offspring. It is one of the strongest and deepest emotions of the human mind and heart, exists as a prompting of nature for the protection and safety of the child, and conduces largely to the happiness, of the parent. It is difficult to define \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d but it is clear it comprises the right to enjoy the \u201cdomestic relations and the privilege of the family and the home.\u201d Black on Constitutional Law, \u00a7 204. To guaranty to a parent the right to the pursuit of happiness forbids that he should be deprived of the right to the custody, the association, and the society of his child, or of his right to teach and train the mind of the \"child and fit it for the walks of life, unless considerations affecting the public welfare require such rights shall be abridged or surrendered for the general good of the state. The parent may, by reason of his failure to appreciate and perform that which is requisite to the moral, intellectual, and physical welfare and development of the child, forfeit his right to the custody and care of his child. The public welfare is concerned in the culture, education, and moral training of children, and the state may supplant the parent as custodian and protector of the child, if the delinquencies or unfitness \u2022of the parent require that the child shall be deemed the ward of the court, acting for the public. The child may be found to be so possessed of and controlled by wicked degeneracy, or so incorrigibly evil, and the parent so indifferent to the moral and intellectual growth of the child, or so otherwise unfit to he intrusted with the power to train and cultivate the mind and conscience of the child, that it may become lawful to commit the child to the public care and custody. In such an event the right of the parent may he deemed secondary to that of the general public as organized for the safety and welfare of mankind. But no such public considerations are here shown to exist. The boy, Samuel, has been shown to be guilty of offenses which in an older and more matured person would be but a misdemeanor, punishable only by a fine of not exceeding $200 for each offense. He is not a dependent, neglected child. His father has not, by any act or omission on his *part, forfeited his right to care for and enjoy the society of and train his son for the \u25a0duties and responsibilities of manhood. That extraordinary exigency which may justify the state in supplanting the father as the natural custodian and protector of his son does not here exist.\nThe property right of the father in and to the services and labor \u2022of his son during his minority would also, under the circumstances of this case and under the proceedings here under consideration, to which the father was not a party, be unlawfully infringed by the assumption on the part of the state of the control and custody of the son on the mere ground that the son had committed the misdemeanor in question. The statute here relied upon to justify the detention \u25a0of said Samuel as a delinquent child, under the circumstances of the case, infringed the constitutional rights of the father, and cannot be enforced. What is here said has no reference to the statute regulating the disposition to be made of \u201cdependent or neglected\u201d children. Moreover, it is to be understood we do not hold the statute .regulating the disposition to be made of delinquent children to be unconstitutional in toto and as to every parent or as to all children,, but that under the circumstances of this particular case constitutional rights of the father have been infringed, and therefore the detention of Samuel Schwartz in the St. Charles Home for Boys, cannot be justified or upheld.\nThere is no force in the contention so strenuously advanced by-counsel for the relator that the proceedings under this statute are criminal proceedings, and that a boy who is the subject of judicial investigation under this statute is entitled to a trial by a jury of 12 men. The proceeding is statutory, and its object is, not the enforcement of the criminal law, but the protection of children. Infants are, in general, in a sense wards of courts of chancery, and the practice and procedure in causes under this statute, affecting,, as they do, the care and custody of minors, and being for the protection of infants, should be that of courts of equity, so far as consistent with the provisions of the statute. The commitment to the home for boys, in cases in which the statute is applicable and is. properly enforced, is not imprisonment as punishment for the violation of the criminal laws of the state or the ordinances of cities and villages, but is merely the assumption of the state, in its capacity of parens patria, of parental authority for the education and reformation of the child, and the home for boys is not to be regarded as. a prison, but is, in fact, a home and a school established by law for the benefit and good of those who are found, under the provisions of the statute, to stand in need of parental care and means of reformation and intellectual-and moral training. Such is the general view of statutes and institutions of this character. Petition of Ferrier, 103 Ill. 367, 43 Am. Rep. 10; Milwaukee Industrial School v. Milwaukee County, 40 Wis. 328, 22 Am.

Lowry versus Reed","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/426999\/","date":"1868-11-07","court":"Supreme Court of Pennsylvania","content":"The facts of the case necessary to its understanding (no paper-books having been furnished) will be found in the opinion of the court, which was delivered, November 17th 1868, by\nThompson, C. J.\nThe petition of the relator in this case was in the usual form, setting forth in general terms that he was illegally restrained' of his liberty by the respondent, the sheriff of Armstrong county \u2014 not by reason or on account of any criminal or supposed criminal matter, and prayed that a habeas corpus might issue to inquire into the cause of his detention. At the same time the counsel for the relator informed the court, that he was in custody on proceedings in an attachment issued against him for refusing to obey the order of the Hon. Joseph Buffington, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of said county, made after hearing on a habeas corpus, to surrender and deliver up to her legal guardian, one Vermadille Funk, a minor under the age of fourteen years, then in his custody. Under these circumstances, at the time we awarded the writ of habeas corpus to bring up the body of the relator, we directed a certiorari to bring up the proceedings in the case, under which he had been committed, returnable at the same time with the habeas corpus. We have, therefore, before us the sheriff\u2019s return, that he detains the prisoner by virtue of a commitment under an attachment issued by the Court of Common Pleas of Armstrong county as for a contempt, and also, the proceedings returned on the certiorari resulting in the commitment.\nOn the argument in this court, it was alleged by the counsel for the relator, that no order had been made on him, on the hearing of the habeas corpus before Judge Buffington, to surrender the body of Vermadille Funk, to her guardian. This is an error. The order appears distinctly endorsed on the writ, and this was sufficient.\nIt was also alleged that it appears by the docket-entries, that the person of the infant was surrendered. There is a clerical error so palpable on the face of the copy of the docket-entries, which must have led to this position, that we need say no more than that the docket-entries, properly understood, prove no such fact as is claimed.\nA failure of the defendants to surrender the, child, pursuant to the order of the judge, and the agreement of its guardian with the relator and his wife, that the child might remain a couple or three weeks with them before being surrendered to him, being shown by the guardian, and that he had made efforts to get possession of the child, by going to the residence of the relator and demanding it, and that it was not there, and that the relator refused to give information where it was, a rule to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him for disobedience to the order made in the case, was granted. The rule was regularly served and the relator answered, setting up a gift of the child by its mother on her death-bed to his wife, its grandmother, and some other matters \u00f3nly proper to be heard on the hearing of the habeas corpus, and he proceeded in substance to allege, that the child was in the custody of its grandmother, by virtue of the gift mentioned, and that he had no legal right to use coercive measures to compel her to give it up, and that this would be required to enable him to give it up, and that such measures would inevitably result in serious family difficulties; that when the sheriff or deputy was at his house with a writ of assistance, he was absent with the child out of the county, at Oil Creek, in Yenango county, and that he had no knowledge of their intention to come on that occasion, and that he has not now, nor had he at any time, the custody and control of the child; and in conclusion he denied the jurisdiction of the court in the premises, protesting at the same time, that he meant no contempt towards the court in refusing obedience to its orders in anything he had done.\nWhile this rule for an attachment was pending, a writ of assistance was granted by the court on the application of the guardian, to which there was a return, that the infant, Vermadille Funk, could not be found, and that on reading it to the relator he declared that his mind remained unchanged, and that he would not surrender the child.\nThe court, under these circumstances, considering the answer to the rule to show cause why an attachment should not issue, as insufficient, did on the 3d of March last commit him to the jail of Armstrong county for disobedience to the order for surrendering up the infant child, named in the habeas corpus and order, and persisting in the same, to be held in custody until said order should be complied with, or the further order of -the court.\nIt is now argued that the agreement referred to, after the order paade by the judge on the habeas corpus, that the child might remain a short time with the relator and his wife before being delivered to its guardian on the order of the judge, was an abandonment of that proceeding, and the order made is not therefore enforceable by process. This is a great mistake. The private parties to the habeas corpus could not bargain away the rights of the infant, incapable by reason of its tender age to consent, by any arrangement. While the temporary arrangements' for delay in separating the infant from its grandparents was quite proper, on the score of deference for their feelings if fairly carried out, yet the Commonwealth, parens patriae, the legal plaintiff, will not permit the judgment of her tribunals in such cases to be disregarded, or set aside without her consent. Were the doctrine insisted on sanctioned, infants of tender, years, taken by process from restraint, and even improper custody, might be continued in it, by the agreement of the parties to the writ of habeas corpus. The court was right in seeing that the order should be enforced. No relinquishment of it, is at all predicable of the agreement in question, which itself resulted from commendable feelings on the part of the guardian.\nNor did the writ of assistance at all interfere with the right to proceed by attachment to enforce the order. Being unproductive of results, and the order remaining unobeyed and disregarded, as its return showed, it was perfectly proper to proceed to allow the process of attachment. This is so obvious that more need not be said as to this objection.\nWe have carefully examined the preliminary proceedings, the foundation for the attachment issued. They are all regular. The rule to show cause was regularly served, and the relator answered it. The court adjudged the answer insufficient, and \u2022with this we fully agree. Omitting to notice allegations in the answer, which were concluded by the order for the surrender of the child, we need only notice that the respondent put his defence or excuse, for refusing obedience to the order, on the ground that the child was exclusively in the custody, and under the control of his wife, its grandmother, and that he could not surrender it without coercive measures, which would greatly disturb his family tranquillity. This was manifestly insufficient. The law regards him as the head of his household; himself and wife one, and he the responsible one, as to all civil requirements. He is the superior in the estimation of the law, howsoever much the fact may be otherwise, and he cannot for a moment shelter himself from responsibility in disobeying process, through a failure to control his wife, or apprehensions of her, or the effect of the execution of process where her feelings might be concerned. Indeed, this allegation stands badly with the facts stated in the answer. In it he admitted that the child was in his personal custody out of the county, when the officer was in pursuit of it with the writ of assistance. It was not in his wife\u2019s custody or under her control then, and this shows that he had its custody when he pleased. Nor does the answer tally well with the return of the officer to the writ of assistance. It appears by that, that when the writ was shown to him he declared he would not surrender the child. He did not then claim that he could not. If the court had been satisfied that the relator really could not surrender it, by means of his wife\u2019s custody where he could not reach it, and that he did not connive at such custody, no doubt he would have escaped commitment on the attachment. But this did not appear, and we think the court had solid grounds for granting the attachment, and committing him upon it.\nThe next thing to be noticed is the power of the court to commit. This was denied on the ground that the commitment was a sentence to imprisonment for contempt. Had this been so, it would have been error; for by the 2d section of the Act of 16th of June 1836, imprisonment extends only to contempts committed in the presence of the court. This case could scarcely be brought under that provision. The error in the position taken is, that the commitment on the attachment was not a sentence for contempt, but an execution of the attachment. The commitment was necessary where its execution, so far as the seizure of the defendant was concerned, had resulted fruitlessly in regard to the matter for which it had issued. An attachment, unlike a ca. sa., requires the recusant party to be brought before the court, and 'if there be no sufficient ground for his discharge, it is the duty of the court to order his commitment until obedience be obtained. Here the commitment was an execution of the attachment, the court expressly declaring it to be for \u201c remedy for the relator.\u201d In Tomes\u2019s Appeal, 14 Wright 285, my brother Agnew proves it to be, in civil cases, a civil remedy. Such manifestly was its nature here, and so intended. We think the court did not transcend its power in the least in its proceedings on the attachment. The only way open for the relator to free himself from his unhappy predicament, is by obeying the order of the court in regard to the infant, Vermadill\u00e9 Funk. That she has been spirited away to \u201cparts unknown,\u201d is his fault, for he ought to have surrendered her when he had the power; and it certainly is much against him, that it can now be said, that it is not known where she is, and that she has been carried out of the'jurisdiction of the court, and out of the knowledge of the community to which she belonged.\nFor these reasons the discharge of the prisoner Alexander Lowry is refused, and he is remanded to the custody of the sheriff, the keeper of the jail of Armstrong county, and it is ordered that he pay the costs of this proceeding."},{"case_name":"Girard v. Philadelphia","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/3450321\/","date":"1868-12-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Mr. Justice GRIER\ndelivered the opinion of the court, arid after observing th'at the attempt to restrain the alienation of the realty, being inoperative, could not affect the validity o\u00ed 'the devise, and that the income of the whole residuary was deyoted\u2019to the three objects stated by the testator, the college being the \u201cprimary object,\u201d and that so long as any portion of this residuary fund should be found necessary for v its improvement and maintenance,\u201d on the plan and to the extent.declared in the will, the second and third objects could claim nothing \u2014 proceeded as follows:\nThe bill admits this to be a valid charity, and claims only the residue after that is satisfied. Now, it is admitted (for it has been so decided), that till February,. 1854, the corporation was vested with a complete title to the whole residue of the estate of Stephen Girard, subject to these charitable trusts, and consequently, at that date, his heirs at law had nri right, title, or interest whatsoever in the same. But the bill alleges that the act of the legislature of that date (commonly called the \u201cConsolidation Act\u201d), which purports to be a supplement to the -original act incorporating the city, has either dissolved or destroyed the. identity of the original corporation, and it is consequently unable any longer to administer the trust. Now, if this were true, the only . consequence would be, not that the charities or trust should fail, but that the chancellor should substitute another trustee.\nIt .is not insisted that the mere change or abbreviation of the name has destroyed the identity of the corporation. The bill even admits that a small addition to its territory and jurisdiction,might not have that effect, but 'that the annexation of twenty-nine boroughs and townships has smothered it to death, or rendered it utterly incapable of administering trusts or charities committed to it when its boundaries were Vine and South Streets, and the two rivers. There is nothing to be found in the letter or spirit of this act which shows any intention in the legislature to destroy the original corporation, either by changing its name,-enlarging its territory, or increasing the number of its corporators. On the contrary, \u201call its powers, rights, privileges and immunities, &c., are continued' in full vigor and effect.\u201d It provides, also, that \u201call the estates, &e.,\u201d held by any of the corporations united by the act, shall'be held \u201cupon and for the same uses, trusts, limitations, charities, and conditions, as the same were then held.\u201d\nBy the act of 4th of April, 1852, the corporation was \u201cauthorized to exercise all such jurisdiction, to enact all such ordinances, and to do and execute all such acts and things whatsoever, as may be necessary for the full and entire acceptance, execution, and prosecution of auy and all the devises, bequests,' trusts, and provisions contained in said will.\u201d It may also \u201c provide, by ordinance or otherwise, for the election and appointment of such officers and agents as they may deem essential to the due execution of the duties and trusts enjoined and created by the will of the late Stephen Girard.\u201d\nNow, it cannot be pretended that the legislature had not the power to appoint another trustee if the act had dissolved the corporation, or to continue the rights, duties, trusts, &c., in the enlarged corporation. It has done so, and has given the widest powers to the trustee to administer the trusts and \u25a0 charities, according to the intent of the testator, as declared in his will.\nThe legislature may alter, modify, or even annul the fran-, tihises of \u00e1 public.municipal corporation, although it may not impose burdens on it without its consent. 1 In this case the .corporation has assented,to accept the changes, assume the burdens, and perform the duties imposed upon it; and it is difficult to conceive how they can have forfeited their right to the charities which the law makes if their duty to administer. The objects of the testator\u2019s charity remain the same, while-the city, large or small, exists; the trust is an existing, ' and valid one, the trustee is vested by law with the estate, and the fullest power and authority to execute the trust.'\nWhatever the fears or fancy of the complainants may be, as to the moral ability of this overgrown corporation, there is no necessary or natural inability which prohibits it from administering this charily as faithfully as it could before its increase.- In fact, it is a matter in which the complainants have no concern whatever, or any right to intervene. If the trust be not rightly administered, the cestui que trust, or the sovereign may require the courts to compel a proper execution.\nIn the case of Vidal, the Supreme Court say, .that \u201cif. the trusts were in themselves valid in point of law, it- is plain that neither the heirs of the testator,, op any other ppivate-person, would have any pight to inquire into or congest the\u2019 right of the corporation to take the property or execute the trust; this'would exclusively belong to .the State in its sovereign capacity, and as parens patriae, and its sole discretion.\u201d\nThis is not an assertion that the \/ legislature,-as parens patriae,, may interfere, by retrospective acts, to, exercise the cy-pres power, which has become so odious from its application in England to what were called superstitious uses. Baxter\u2019s case, and other similar ones,, cannot be precedents-where there is no established church which treats all dissent as superstition. But it cannot admit of a doubt that, where there is a valid devise to \u00e1 corporation, in trust for chart table purposes, Unaffected by any question as t\u00f3 its v\u00e1lidity because of superstition, the sovereign may interfere to enforce the execution of the trusts, either by'changing the administrator, -if the corporation be dissolved, or, if not, by modifying or enlarging its franchises, provided the. trust be not perverted, and no wrong done to the beneficiaries. Where the trustee is a corporation, no modification of its franchises, or change in its name, while its identity remains, \u25a0 can affect- its rights to hold property devised to -it for any purpose. Nor can a valid, vested estate, in trust, lapse or become forfeited by any misconduct in .the trustee, or inability in the corporation to execute it, if such existed.. Charity never fails; and it is the right, as well as the duty of the sovereign, by its courts and public officers, as also\u2019 by legislation (if needed)* to have the charities properly administered.\nNow, there is no complaint here that the charity, so far as regards the primary and great object of the testator, is not properly.administered; and it does' not appear that there now is, or ever will be, any residue to apply to the secondary, objects. If that time should ever arrive, the question, whether the charity, shall .be so applied as to have the \u201c effect to diminish the burden of taxation \u201d on all the corporation, or only those within the former boundaries of the city, will have to be decided. The case of Soohan v. The City, does not decide it; nor is this court bound to decide it. .- The answer shows how it may be done, and the corporation has ample power conferred on 'it to execute the trust according' to either hypothesis;, and, if further powers were necessary, the legislature, executing the sovereign-power, can certainly grant them. In the meantime the heirs at law of the testator have no concern in-the matter, or any right to interfere by a bill quia timet. Their anticipations of -the future perversion of the charity by the corruption or folly of.the enlarged corporation, and the moral impossibility of its just administration, are not sufficient reasons for the interference of this court to seize upon the' fund, or any part.pf it, and to deliver it- up to the complainants, who never had, and by the will of Stephen Girard, were not intended to have any right, title, or claim whatsoever to the property.\nIn fine, the bill was rightly dismissed, because:\n1st. The residue of the estate of -St\u00e9phen Girard, at- the time of his death, was, by his will, vested in the corporation oil valid legal trusts, which it was fully competent to execute.\n2d. By the supplement to the act incorporating the city (commonly called the \u201c Consolidation Act\u201d)j the identity of the corporation is not destroyed; nor can the change jn its name, the enlargement of its area, or increase in the number of its corporators, afiect its title to property held at the time of such change.\n3d. The corporation, under its amended charter, has every capacity to hold, and every power and authority necessary t\u00f3 e'xecute the trusts of the-will.\n4th. That the difficulties anticipated by the bill, as to the execution of the secondary trusts, are imaginary. They have not arisen, and most probably never will.,\n5th. And if they should, it is a matter, whether probable or improbable, with which the complainants have no concern, and cannot have on any possible contingency..\nDecree affirmed with costs.'\n\u2020\nVidal v Girard, 2 Howard, 127.\n*\n2 Howard, 191."},{"case_name":"ELIZABETH H.

Hough, in the following words: \u201c The personal care, custody, and control of my said children I do hereby confide to my dear mother solely, except in such cases as my said trustees and executors may deem contrariwise for the purposes of education.\u201d And, in connection, upon the further ground that the plaintiff is not a suitable person to be intrusted with the personal custody and tuition of the children.\nThe case shows, as the Court below found\u2014which finding we see no cause to disturb\u2014that the plaintiff, and the defendant Olive S. Hough, are both, in all respects, qualified and fit persons to have the nurture and tuition of the children. The claim of the plaintiff, so far as it is to be considered by this-Court-, is, therefore, founded solely upon her legal rights as mother, and the claim of the defendant Olive S. Hough solely upon her legal rights as testamentary guardian. The Court below reached the conclusion that the legal rights of the mother were superior to those of the testamentary guardian, and, therefore, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\nThere were four kinds of guardians at common law, called respectively guardians by nature, guardians for nurture, guardians in socage, and guardians in chivalry. The guardians by nature were the father, and, in some cases, the mother of the children. Guardians for nurture were, also, the father or mother, and continued until the child attained the age of fourteen years. Guardianship in socage took place only when the infant was entitled to an estate in lands by descent, and the next of kin, to whom the estate could not possibly descend, became the guardian in socage. Guardianship in socage, like those for nurture, continued only until the infant was fourteen years of age, at which age he was presumed to have attained sufficient discretion and judgment to choose a guardian for himself, and, therefore, was allowed to do so, subject, however, to the approval of the Court of Chancery. Guardianship in socage included the custody and care of both the person and the estate of the infant. Guardianship in chivalry was a feature of the feudal system, and took place when lands came to an infant by descent, which were held by knight service. It continued until the infant attained the age of twenty-one years, if a male, and sixteen if a female, and related to both person and estate, without any obligation to account for the profits of the latter. (1 Blackst. Com., Chap. 17; 2 Blackst. Com., Chap. 5.) These guardians were appointed or designated by the common law itself, except that the Chancellor, by virtue of his authority as representative of the King, who was the parens patriae,, and, as such, the guardian of all the infants in the kingdom, was allowed to appoint guardians to such infants as were without guardians by common law.\nBy statute, (12 Car. II, c. 24,) among other things, tenure by knight service and wardships in chivalry were abolished, and in view of this abolition of guardianship in chivalry, which continued until the full age of the ward, and in view, also, of the imbecility of judgment in children of the age of fourteen, (as we are told by Blackstone,) it was, by the same statute, further enacted \u201cthat where any person hath or shall have any child or children, under the age of one and twenty years, and not married at the time of his death, that it shall and may be lawful to and for the father of such child or children, whether born at the time of the decease of such father, or at that time in venire sa mere, or whether such father be within the age of one and twenty years, or of full age by his deed, executed in his lifetime, or by his last will and testament in writing, in the presence of two or more credible witnesses, in such manner, and from time to time, as he shall respectively think fit, to dispose of the custody and tuition of such child or children, for and during.such time as he or they shall respectively remain under the age of one and twenty years, or any lesser time, to any person or persons in possession or remainder, other than Popish recusants ; and that such disposition of the custody of such child or children, made since the 24th of February, 1645, or hereafter to be made, shall he good and effectual against all and every person or persons claiming the custody or tuition of such child or children as guardian in socage, or otherwise. And that such person or persons, to whom the custody of such child or children hath been .or shall be so disposed of or devised as aforesaid, shall and may maintain an action of ravishment of ward or trespass against any person or persons which shall wrongfully take away or detain such child or children, for the recovery of such child or children; and shall and may recover damages for the same in the said action, for the use and \"benefit of such child or children.\n\u201cThat such person or persons, to whom the custody of such child or children hath been or shall be so disposed or devised, shall and may take into his or their custody, to the use of such child or children, the profits of all lands, tenements, and hereditaments of such child or children; and also the custody, tuition, and management of the goods, chattels, and personal estate of such child or children, till their respective age of one and twenty years, or any lesser time, according to such disposition aforesaid; and may bring such action or actions in relation thereunto as by law a guardian in common socage might do.\u201d (Eng. Stats, at Large, 12 Cha. II to 7 and 8; Will. III, p. 27, Sec. 89.)\nAlthough, as appears from the face of this statute, the practice of. appointing testamentary guardians had previously prevailed to some extent, yet it had not then ripened into a custom of such duration as to make it a part of the common law; hence this statute is the source of the posthumous power of the father over the custody and tuition of his children. By this statute, the posthumous custody of his children was placed as absolutely at his disposal as his lands had been under the Statute of Wills of 32 Henry VIII. His power to devise his lands under the latter was not greater nor more complete than his power under the former to devise the custody and tuition of his children, for the testamentary guardian was endowed with all the powers of a guardian in socage, and his claims were expressly declared to bo superior to all persons claiming the custody of the children as guardians, or in any other capacity. Hnder it, no.power over or right to the custody or tuition of her children was recognized as existing in the mother; on the contrary, the power conferred upon the father was unqualified, and extended even to the child yet in its mother\u2019s womb. In this, however, the philosophy of the statute was not retrogressive; on the contrary, it was in exact accord with the barbarism of the com mon law, which endowed the husband with the wife\u2019s estate, and merged the existence of the mother in that of the father, or esteemed her of but little more consequence than the chief of his servants. To her the common law grudgingly accorded the reverence and respect of her children, but no power over them. (1 Black. Com. 458.)\nWhile the testamentary guardian took precedence o.f all other persons in respect to the custody and tuition of his ward, and the care and management of his ward\u2019s estate, like all other guardians, he was but a trustee, and, for that reason, was, like them, subject to the general supervision and control of the Court of Chancery, even to the extent of removal, if found unfaithful to his trust. In the case of Beaufort v. Betty, 1 P. Will. 702, Lord Macclesfield said, with some warmth, \u201cthat testamentary guardians were but trustees, and that the statute, by enabling the father to devise the guardianship of his children, did no more than empower the father by will to choose a different person from him or her that would have been guardian in socage\u2014a different person than what the law would have appointed\u2014and to continue that guardianship to a different time than the guardianship in socage would have continued, viz: until twenty-one instead of fourteen. But that still a guardian appointed according to the statute had no more power than a guardian in socage; and as the Court could interpose where there was a guardianship in socage, so might it also do in case of a guardian by the statute, both being equally trustees; that, suppose one should devise lands to trustees to sell for such a price as they should think fit, for the payment of debts, there could be no doubt but that this Court, at the desire of any single creditor, might and would interpose, and order the estate not to bo sold as the trustees should think fit, but for the best price before the Master; and as the Court would interpose where the estate of a man was devised in trust, so would it, a fortiori, concern itself in the custody of a child\u2019s being devised to a guardian, who was but a person intrusted in that case, since nothing could be of a greater concern than the education of infants, and more especially of this \u25a0noble lord, in whom the public was interested, and from whom his prince and country might justly have expectations;\u201d and, accordingly, the Lord Chancellor further declared that he would not only interpose where the testamentary guardian had misbehaved, hut he would also interpose where there was any reasonable ground to apprehend misbehavior, upon the principle that \u201cpreventing justice is to be preferred to punishing justice.\u201d\nThe power of the Court of Chancery to direct, restrain, and control all guardians in the performance of their duties, whether they be appointed by the common law or by statute, and even to remove them and put others in their places, if they misbehave or purpose doing so, is settled beyond controversy. (In the matter of Andrews, 1 Johns. Ch. 109.) Guardians are but the lieutenants of the Chancellor. They exercise but a trust, and are, at all times, subject to the inquisition of the Chancellor, and amenable to his orders. But while the Court of Chancery has the control and superintendence of all guardians, however appointed, yet it can no more interpose in matters of guardianship, without cause, than it can interpose without cause in other matters which are within its jurisdiction. Chancery will not interfere and remove a guardian who has been legally appointed, unless for misbehavior. The guardian appointed by either the common law or statute has a legal right to the trust, of which he cannot be deprived except for reasons in equity. The discretion of the Chancellor, of which mention is frequently made in connection with his power of supervision and removal of guardians, is not an arbitrary or capricious, but a judicial discretion, to be exercised not in total disregard but with due regard to all the legal rights of all concerned ; otherwise, it would be vain to provide by law that the father, or the person by him selected, shall have the guardianship of his child, for it would lie in the mouth of the Chancellor to say whether he should or not. To say that the father may devise the custody of liis child, but the Chan cellor may, of his own motion, and without cause, turn the devisee oat of his trust, and put a person of his own selection in his place, is to say, in the same breath, that the father and guardian has, and has not, a legal right, the one to devise and the other to retain the custody of his child or ward. In no case, so far as we are advised, has the Court of Chancery undertaken to interfere with a guardian, without assigning therefor some reason in equity. In the Duke of Beaufort\u2019s Case it was contended that the Court could not interfere, until the guardian had, in fact, abused' his trust. Although this limitation upon the power of the Court was denied by the Lord Chancellor, who remarked, as already stated, that preventive was better than punitive justice, yet he added, \u201c That if any wrong steps had been taken, which might not deserve punishment, yet, if they were such as induced the least suspicion of the infant\u2019s being like to suffer by the conduct of the guardians, or if the guardians chose to make use of methods that might turn to the prejudice of the infant, the Court would interpose, and order the contrary, and that this was grounded upon the general power and jurisdiction which it had over all trusts, and a guardianship was most plainly a trust.\u201d It was not pretended that the Court held any sovereign power in the premises, and the ground upon which its power was placed (the ground that guardians are trustees) fully demonstrates the character of the power to be judicial.\nIn view of the ground upon which it is founded it is obvious that the power of the Court in relation to guardianships is not different from its power in relation to other trusts, and that, like the latter, its exercise is to be governed by the rules of equity; that is to say, by the judicial, and not the extra judicial will of the Chancellor. It follows that if the law of England in the time of Charles II is the law of this State, the custody of these children cannot be taken, upon the facts of this case, from the guardian appointed by their deceased father.\nOn the part of the appellant it is claimed that this English statute in relation to testamentary guardians, passed more than two hundred years ago and reflecting upon its face all the harsher features of the ancient common law in relation to the rights of a woman as wife and mother, has been in substance and legal effect adopted in this State. It would be a little surprising if, under a Constitution which has disendowed the husband of the wife\u2019s estate and recognized her own property as hers, her marital bondage in relation to her children has been continued by the re-enactment of a rule of conduct which had. its origin when social and civil life had attained a point bat a little above the level of semi-barbarism\u2014a rule which is now repugnant to every one\u2019s sense of natural right and the natural order and fitness of things. To admit that the right of the father to the custody and control of the children is superior to that of the mother, other things being equal, is well; for the admission is founded upon the rational probability that, all things considered, he is more competent, by reason of his greater experience and better judgment, to rear, educate and settle them in life; but to continue this power after death, and enable the father, through mere whim, caprice, or a worse motive, or, at least, without rational cause, as the Court below has found in this case, to add to the loss of a father the loss of a mother also \u2014to deprive a mother of the nurture and tuition of those to whom her own pains and throes have given life, or, which is equally vicious, if not more so, to deprive infant children of the nurse which nature has provided for them in sickness, and of the guardian whose careful watchings and tender teachings in time of health, cannot come except from maternal love, is to convert children into goods and chattels, and to lower parental love and care to the level of animal instinct. A power so easily abused and so pregnant with mischief to mother and children ought not to be exercised, except in view of conditions, which, out of consideration for the literary, moral and religious education of the children, would justify a Court of Chancery in taking them from the mother\u2019s custody. Such a power is inconsistent with the other rights of married women, under the Constitution and laws of this State, and \u2019the statute, if such there be, by which it is conferred, should be so modified as to reflect the same rational views in respect to the rights of the mother in relation to the custody of her children, which have been declared in respect to her other rights. In a country where it is declared that the property of the wife, held by her at the time of her marriage, shall not be by the act of marriage forfeited to the use and benefit of her husband, but shall, as before, continue hers, and further, that the property afterward acquired shall be the common property of both; it would be anomalous to find that, as mother, her rights have been left to the semi-barbarous rule of the common law, by which she would be entitled to no power over her children, but only to their reverence and respect. We are glad to find that we are able to avoid a result so anomalous by, as wo consider, a fair and reasonable construction of the statute of this State in relation to the appointment of guardians.\nThe power of the father to appoint a guardian by his last will and testament is granted by the tenth section of the statute, which reads as follows: \u201cThe father of any child who is a minor may, by his last will and testament, appoint a guardian or guardians of such child, whether born before or after the time of making such will, and in the case of the death of the father, the mother of such child may in like manner appoint a guardian or guardians if such child shall not then have any legally appointed guardian; and every testamentary guardian shall give bonds and qualify, and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties loith regard to the person and estate of such minor as guardians appointed by the Probate Court, except as far as the said powers and duties may have been legally modified, enlarged or changed by the will by which such guardian was appointed.\u201d\nThis statute, unlike the English statute, it will be observed, does not, in terms, provide that the testamentary guardian shall have the custody and tuition of the ward, or what shall be his powers and duties in any respect, but provides that his powers and duties shall, be the same as if he had been appointed by the Probate Court, except so far as they may have been legally modified by will. It does not even declare for what time the testamentary guardian may be appointed. So, for the purpose of ascertaining the precise extent of his powers, we are referred to those portions of the statute which relate to the powers of guardians who are appointed by the Probate Court. But it is not necessary to look at length into that subject. The question we are to answer requires an investigation only as to one point, viz: under what circumstances is the personal custody and tuition of the ward given to the probate guardian? For, the powers of the testamentary guardian being the same, he may take the custody of the person and tuition of the ward when the probate guardian could have done so, and not otherwise. Upon this point the meaning of the statute is not so plain and obvious as it might have been made; yet, by comparing\u2019 several sections one with the other, we consider its meaning, to be that, in all .cases where the appointment of a guardian shall appear necessary or convenient, the father shall be first in legal right; and if the father be deceased, the mother, while unmarried, if they be competent to transact their own business, and are not otherwise unsuitable; and that, if another be appointed, he is not entitled to the personal custody and tuition of the ward, so long as the latter has a father or mother living who is competent to care for and educate him, and is not otherwise unsuitable. These rules we deduce from the fifth and sixth sections of the statute, which read as follows :\n\u201c Section 5. The father of the minor, if living, and in case of his decease, the mother, while she remains unmarried, being themselves respectively competent to transact their own business, and not otherwise unsuitable, shall be entitled to the guardianship of the minor.\n\u201c Section 6. If the minor have no father or mother, living and competent to have the custody and care of the education of such minor, the guardian so appointed shall have the custody and tuition of his ward.\u201d\nThe rule here prescribed is according to the law of nature. It. selects the same guardians, if not otherwise unsuitable, which nature has appointed, and in the same order\u2014the father first, and the mother next. If, from any cause, these cannot be had to act in respect to the infant\u2019s estate, they are still retained to serve as guardians by nature and for nurture; and only in the event that neither can be had for that purpose, is the personal custody of the minor delivered over to a stranger.\nSo the testamentary guardian, since he has only the powers of a probate guardian, cannot take the personal custody and tuition of the minor, so long as there is a mother who is competent, willing, and worthy to have the custody and tuition of her child. Or, in other words, the only effect of the tenth section is to give the appointment of a guardian-first to the father, second to the mother, and lastly to the Probate Court; for the powers of the guardian, by whomsoever appointed, are the same, except as modified in the case of the testamentary guardian, by the will by which he has been appointed, which exception obviously refers only to such special and lawful directions as the testator may see proper to give with reference to the education of the minor, his settlement in life, or the management of his estate, among which, for the reasons already stated, the taking of the personal custody and tuition of the minor from the mother, if competent and worthy, cannot be included.\nOur conclusion is that the custody and tuition of wards is fixed by the statute, and that the rule of the statute cannot be annulled by the will of the' father.\nJudgment affirmed."},{"case_name":"Thomson\u2019s Executors, appellants, and Norris and others, respondents","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/526200\/","date":"1869-03-01","court":"New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals","content":"The opinion of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\nThe widow and next of kin of the late John R. Thomson, claim in this suit the right, certain specific and pecuniary legacies having been paid, to dispense with his will, and distribute among themselves, in proportions which they have agreed upon, the entire residue of his estate. In pursuance of this view of their rights, these parties entered into an agreement under seal, by force of which the widow is to take two thirds of this residue of the property, and the next of kin, being the brother and three sisters of the testator, the remaining third part. It was to enforce this contract against Mr. Thomson\u2019s executors and trustees, that the bill in this cause was filed.\nThe argument, before this court, in behalf of the complainants went upon three grounds: first, that one of the provisions of the will was, from an intrinsic defect, invalid; second, that a power of appointment conferred by the will upon the widow, could be legally released by her; and third, that at all events, the contract between the widow and next of kin had been legalized by an act of the legislature of this state.\nThe first of the grounds thus taken, has reference to that clause of the will which, with regard to a certain portion of the accumulated income of the estate, declares, that the testator\u2019s widow \u201c shall be authorized and empowered, by her last will and testament, to give and devise the same among such benevolent, religious, or charitable institutions as she may think proper.\u201d Such a bequest, upon the most familiar principles, is not to be sustained except upon the theory that it constitutes a gift to a charitable use. Is the purpose indicated, then, a charity in a legal point of view ? I do not understand that there is any difference whatever between the common law of England and the law of this state upon the point as to what constitutes the legal definition of a' charity. And by this common law I mean that system, so far as respects this question, which has grown up in a series of decisions founded, in part, upon the 43d of Elizabeth, ch. 4, (the statute of charitable uses). The doctrine of the-English Court of Chancery with regard to the mere classification of things which are, and those which are not, charities in the eye of the law, has been very generally recognized in this country. The discrepancy between the English and American systems regulating charities, consists in this, \u25a0that in England a bequest for a charity will be effectuated no matter how uncertain the objects or the persons may be, or whether the bequest can be carried into exact execution, or not, for when a literal execution becomes impracticable,, the court will administer it on the doctrine of ey pres. In some instances courts of this country have refused to exercise so extensive a jurisdiction. I am not aware, that in our own courts, this subject has received any elucidation. It may well be, therefore, that a bequest, obviously for a charity, and which in England would be carried into effect, might not be enforced in our own courts, on the ground of the indefiniteness of its objects or the impracticability of its exact execution. But this is a diversity of legal administra tion, and not of legal classification. Upon the questions what is, or what is not, a charitable use we have no criterion but the rules of the common law, and those rules, consequently, are obligatory upon us.\nAccepting this guide I readily come, on this head, to the same conclusion with the Chancellor. The bequest is to \u201c benevolent, religious, or charitable institutions.\u201d This is too broad. Benevolence is wider than charity in its legal signification. In James v. Allen, 3 Mer. 17, the will gave property to \u201c be applied and disposed of for, and to such benevolent purposes\u201d as the executors, in their discretion, might unanimously agree on. Sir William Grant, Master of the Eolls, decided this bequest void, remarking, \u201cthat although many charitable institutions are very properly called benevolent, it is impossible to say that every object of a man\u2019s benevolence is also an object of his charity.\u201d The ground of the decision was, that as the bequest could, consistently with the will, be applied to other than strictly charitable purposes, the court could not execute the trust. In Williams v. Kershaw, 5 Clark & Fin. 111, note, the devise was to \u201csuch benevolent, charitable, and religious purposes as the executors should, in their discretion, think most advantageous and beneficial.\u201d Upon a review of the authorities the decision of Lord Coltenham was, that the introduction of the word \u201cbenevolent\u201d rendered the purposes, of the testator too indefinite for judicial execution, and that the gift could not take effect. Ellis v. Selby, 1 Myl. & Craig 286, and Williams v. Williams, 5 Law Journal, ch. 4, are cases holding a similar doctrine, and are much in point* Many other decisions to the same effect will be found collected in 2 Roper on Leg. 1237. These decisions appear to me to rest on a proper foundation. It is important that the fact, as to what are legal charities, which will be executed by the courts, should be settled. To sanction the introduction of a genera] term of so wide a signification as the word \u201c benevolent\u201d would have a tendency to involve the subject in much confusion.\nUpon the argument, the counsel for the respondent laid some stress on the use, in the testamentary clause, of the word \"institutions.\u201d But, upon reflection, I am unable to see that this term has a tendency to give definiteness to the expression of the use intended. If, in legal contemplation, a benevolent purpose is more indefinite, embracing a larger class of objects, than a charitable purpose, it seems to follow, necessarily, that \u00e1 benevolent institution may not, in a legal sense, be a charitable institution. An institution is a mere organism for the accomplishment of an object, and the existence of such organism cannot, in the nature of things, make such object definite. To make the argument of any value it should appear that the class of benevolent purposes, which are not comprehended in the definition of legal charities, are not and cannot be executed by institutions, that is, associations of persons. In Babb v. Reed, 5 Rawle 151, it was held that an association for the purposes of mutual benevolence among its members, is not an association for charitable uses. Here, then, was a benevolent institution which was not a charitable one. Other similar instances will readily suggest themselves. I think the word in question does not restrict the meaning of the term \u201c benevolent \u201d in the clause under consideration.\nAs I have already said, I concur in the conclusion that the disposition comprised in this clause of the will, on the ground just specified, is invalid.\nThe second point relates to the capacity of the widow to surrender her power of appointment over that portion of the estate which is set apart for the raising of her income.\nThis branch of the case was disposed of by the Chancellor, on the technical distinction which, in the doctrine of powers, exists between a power in gross and a power simply collateral. The power of appointment contained in the clause of the -will now alluded to, was regarded as belonging to the former class, and, consequently, as extinguishable by the donee of the power. This question seems to me to be one of great nicety in the application of the decisions to the present case. I have not found any case in which it was maintained that a power to appoint to strangers, after the expiration of an interest given to the donee of the power, was a power in gross. The decisions referred to by counsel are mostly cases of settlement on a parent, with a power of appointment among his children. In such instances, there is some reason to say the power is not simply collateral, because it is not a naked authority, the father having an interest in the distribution of the estate among his children. Under such circumstances, such a power may not inaptly, in the expression of Sir Edward Sugden, be called \u201c an emolument of his own estate.\u201d But, on the contrary, when an interest, for life or for years, is given to A, with direction, by will or otherwise, to appoint between B and C, who are strangers to A, why such an authority should be considered anything more than an authority simply collateral, it seems difficult to imagine. I have found no case which determines this question either way; those cases in which the fund, on failure of appointment, is given to the donee of the power, resting obviously on a different principle; and I shall pass the question without the expression of any opinion upon it. I am enabled to do this because, in my examination of the matters involved, I have come to the conclusion, that there is an insuperable difficulty in granting to the complainants the relief prayed for, so far as their claim to such relief rests on general legal principles.\nEor the purpose of considering the difficulty thus intimated, I shall assume that the power in question is one in gross, and one, consequently, that Mrs. Thomson could legally' release. The proposition then arises, can she release it for a consideration ? In order to comprehend fully the force of this inquiry, we must place before our minds distinctly the circumstances of her position. Her authority is given to her in the following terms: \u201c And I authorize and empower my said wife, by her last will and testament, duly executed, to direct, limit or appoint, give or devise the portion of my estate so appropriated for an income of $10,000 a year for her support, to give or devise the same to and among all and every the children of my sisters, Caroline Norris and Amelia Reed, and their children, in such proportions and for such estate or estates as she may think proper; or, if my wife so chooses, - she may, by her last will and testament aforesaid, direct, limit or appoint, give or devise the same to^ and- among my- sisters, Caroline, Adeline, and Amelia, and their children and grandchildren, and my brother, Edward, in such proportions and for such estate or estates as she may think proper.\u201d\nIt will be observed, from this quotation from the will, that as appointees the children and grandchildren of Mrs. Norris and Mrs. Read are peculiarly favored. Mrs. Thomson had the right to appoint the whole of this part of the estate to them. In no distribution which she is authorized to make, could they or any of them be omitted. By the arrangement which she has, in point of fact, made with the brother and three sisters of the testator, these children are cut off fropi all possibility of taking any benefit under an appointment. Both the bill of complaint and the articles of agreement state that Mrs. Thomson consented to extinguish the power of appointment in consideration of the division of the residue of the estate, after the payment of specific and pecuniary legacies, by which division two thirds of such residue became her own, absolutely. The children of the sisters of the testator are no parties to this contract. In considering the legal maxim involved it must be treated, then, as a case in which a donee of a power has agreed, for a benefit moving to herself, to surrender her right to appoint.\nCan any plausibility be given to such a claim ? A power to appoint is not a technical trust it is true, because the possible beneficiary has not the capacity to call for its execution. But it has never been doubted that such a function was a confidence, and as such cannot be made the subject of barter. Courts of equity have very characteristically exercised the keenest vigilance over this class- of agents. The principle which I regard as established is, that they shall gain no profit by force of their position. Any other rule \u2022would be impracticable. If it be lawful for the donee of a power to bargain for his own personal ends with a part of the appointees to exercise his authority in a certain mode, or to stipulate with the heirs-at-law or the next of kin to disappoint the expectations of the appointees by a surrender of his power, it is obvious in numerous cases the bulk of the fiduciary property would enure to the benefit of the donees themselves. It is on this obvious ground that courts everywhere have been strenuous in enforcing the utmost good faith on the part of donees of powers. I think no case can be found in which such donee has been allowed to make his position, by any device, profitable to himself. Such is the uniform language of the authorities. In Aleyn v. Belchier, 1 Eden 132, a power of jointuring having been executed in favor of a wife, but with an agreement that the wife should, receive only a part as an annuity for her own benefit, and that the residue should be applied to the payment of the husband\u2019s debts, such arrangement was held a fraud upon the power, the Lord Keeper saying, that \u201c no point is better established than that a person having a power must execute it bona fide for the end designed, otherwise it is corrupt and void.\u201d And upon the same principle it has been settled, in a series of cases, that whenever an appointment is made to one or more of a class, in exclusion of others, upon a bargain for the advantage of the appointor, equity will relieve against such an appointment as a fraud upon the power. In one of this class of cases, Rowley v. Rowley, Kay 242, Sir \"W. Page \"Wood, V. 0., said: \u201c I think it would be impossible to contend, if a direct bribe were given to the appointor, though out of a separate fund, that the appointment could be upheld in favor of a party to whom the fund, subject to the appointment, was given.\u201d And in McQueen v. Farquhar, 11 Ves. 479, Lord Eldon remarks: \u201cIt is truly said, this court will not permit a party to execute a power for his own benefit.\u201d A large number of cases illustrative of the same rule may be found in 1 Lead. Cas. in Eq. 304.\nThese authorities abundantly suffice to show that the principle is unquestionably established, that an appointment to further the selfish interest of the donee of the power will not stand. The doctrine rests upon the ground of the existence of constructive bad faith towards the donor of the power. And a gainful agreement to refrain altogether from the exercise of the power is necessarily equally fraudulent; it involves, no matter how pure1 the intentions of all parties may be, a constructive fraud. In Gunynghame v. Thurlow, (note to West v. Berney,) 1 Russ. & My. 431, the case of a release of a power to appoint was prevented, the donee gaining an advantage from such release. In this case, a fund was limited to a father for life, with remainder to his children in such shares as he should appoint, and in default of appointment, to the children equally; the father released the power as to a portion of the fund, so as to vest a share of it in himself, as executor of a deceased son, who in default of appointment, took a vested interest; but the court-refused to order the transfer of this share to the father. It will be observed that in the case cited the father had the undoubted right to extinguish his power of appointment ; but as he did this in consideration of a benefit to himself the act was declared illegal. The principle of this \u2022case applies, with entire aptness, to the facts contained in the bill now before this court. I feel constrained to say, therefore, that in my opinion, a court of equity cannot sanction the contract which these parties have entered into, on any of the principles which usually regulate the relations of parties having an interest under a power of appointment. And as an evidence of the strength of my own conviction on this subject, I may remark that I have been led to this result notwithstanding my most perfect confidence that the agreement thus impeached in point of law, has been entered into in entire good faith by all' the parties to it. I am entirely satisfied that the interest of the other appointees has not in the least degree been sacrificed, but has been scrupulously considered. Nor have I entertained the faintest suspicion that the donee of the power in this case has taken any advantage whatever of the position in which she was placed by her husband. I am persuaded that the agreement in question was intended to be, what it purports to be, a fair family settlement. My difficulty lias been to find any legal general ground of equity on which to rest a claim in favor of the case made by the bill.\nBefore leaving this head of the case, it is proper to remark that I have assumed that one or more of the sisters of the testator has children living. This fact was stated on the argument. The pleadings are silent upon the subject, but, as the existence of such children is not negatived in the bill, the presumption must be in favor of their existence, on the principle that the complainants are bound to make out all the necessary circumstances on which their title to relief rests.\nThe only remaining foundation for the case of the complainants is the act of the legislature in confirmation of the agreement mentioned in the bill. There are but very few of these acts of special legislation which I regard as possessed of any legal validity. It does not seem to me that their inefficacy arises merely when they conflict with the positive prohibitions of the constitution, or when they disturb vested estates. As a general rule, I think they cannot meddle with vested rights. I have no belief that, by a special act, a \u2022man\u2019s right or expectancy to a contingent remainder, or under an executory devise, can be cut off. Nevertheless, there are some cases in which, from ancient custom, a power of special legislation may be said to subsist as a function of the law making power. The extent of such right will be always \u25a0questionable. In the present instance, the right to ho affected by the act is very remote, and of the most contingent character. These children and grandchildren, whose rights alone are affected by the statute in question, have no interest which is capable of being enforced in any court, unless they should first obtain an appointment in their favor. Their interest, then, is the mere possibility that Mrs. Thomson, in derogation of her agreement with their parents, should appoint a part of this fund to them. It may be that, against such a mere possibility, this act of the legislature should prevail. The decision of the Chancellor is in favor of its efficiency for the purpose designed; and leaning, in a great measure, on that opinion, I shall, on this ground, vote for the affirmance of the decree rendered in the Court of Chancery.\nThe decree was affirmed by the following vote:\nFor affirmance \u2014 Beasley, C.

Clowry, Adm\u2019r, etc. vs. Unknown Heirs of Patrick Brennan, Margaret Brennan, etc.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4796664\/","date":"1869-11-01","court":"Illinois Circuit Court","content":"Jameson, J.: \u2014\nOn the first of June, 1863, Patrick Brennan, who was seized of lot 5, in block 3, in Brainard & Evans\u2019 addition to Chicago, together with his wife, Margaret, conveyed the same to one Martin Brennan as trustee, in trust to secure certain sums at a certain time therein mentioned, payable to another Patrick Brennan, whom I shall designate as Patrick Brennan 2d. Brennan. 1st died Nov. 14, 1865, intestate, leaving Margaret, his widow, but no children or descendants of children surviving. Margaret was afterwards duly appointed the administratrix of his estate, on the 19th of July, 1866. In the mean time, on the 4th of January, 1866, Martin Brennan, the trustee, advertised for non-payment of the amount due, and sold the lot in question, under the power in the trust deed, Patrick Brennan 2d, the creditor, being the purchaser. On the 13th of September of the same year, Patrick Brennan 2d, in consideration of $5.00, conveyed to Margaret Brennan, widow, and to the unknown heirs of Patrick Brennan, deceased, the lot in question, except the west twenty feet thereof. The quantity of the estate thus conveyed to the several parties was described in the deed as follows: \u201cTo.the said Margaret Brennan one-half, undivided, of the premises above described, absolutely and in fee simple, and moreover, such other and further interest, if any, in the remaining half of said premises, as she, the said Margaret Brennan, as widow of the said Patrick Brennan, deceased, would be entitled to, under the law of Illinois, if her husband had died seized of an unencumbered title, in fee simple, to the said premises; and the residue of the said remaining half of the said premises shall be had and held in fee simple by the said unknown heirs of the said Patrick Brennan, deceased. \u2019 \u2019\nIn June, 1867, Margaret Brennan, the widow, died, leaving a 'will, which was duly proved, and in which she named the late Dr. Dennis Dunne, her executor. By this will, she directed the said Dunne to sell her real estate, and that the proceeds thereof, after the payment of her debts, be divided as follows: \u201cThe sum of $500 to Patrick Donohoe, of Greens-burgh, in the state of Pennsylvania, and all the rest and residue of the proceeds of said real estate, be given by her executor to such charitable and religious purposes as he might deem fit.\u201d\nLetters testamentary were issued to Dennis Dunne, on the 19th of June, 1867, but he died in December, 1868, and the petitioner, Thomas Glowry, was appointed administrator de bonis non, with the will annexed. Dennis Dunne also left a will in which he appointed Edward Dunne and John Goughian, his- executors; the latter of whom qualified, and is made a defendant in this case. This petition was filed by the administrator de bonis non, dowry, for a partition of this lot, to enable him to carry out the provisions of the will of Margaret Brennan, under the directions of this court.\nThe first question is, to determine the respective shares of Margaret Brennan and of the heirs of her husband, Patrick Brennan, deceased, under the conveyance from Patrick Brennan 2d. There then remains a second question: What directions shall be given by this court, respecting the bequest to charitable uses, made by Margaret Brennan, under the circumstances of the case?\nThe real nature of the conveyance by Patrick Brennan 2d, is admitted to have been this: he desired only to be paid his debt, and finding that the west twenty feet of the lot would do that, he wished, like an honest man, to give the residue of it back to those who would have had it on the death of Patrick Brennan 1st, and it is probable that he desired them to take in the same proportions as if Patrick Brennan had died seized of that alone. The phraseology of the dead has already been given. It was contended by the petitioner, before the master, upon whose report this case comes up, that the true construction of this language was that the widow should have one-half of the residue of the lot after reserving the twenty feet, absolutely, and that the other half should be apportioned between her and the heirs of her husband as it would have been had her husband died seized of that half only; in which case, she would have, first, one-half in her own right, by virtue of the conveyance to her by Patrick Brennan 2d, and then, one-half of the remaining half, that is, one-quarter of the premises, under the 46th section of the statute of wills as heir to her husband, and beside this, would have her dower in the remaining quarter; making, in all, a fee in three-fourths of the premises, and dower in the other fourth. This, in my judgment, in which I agree with the master in his report, is not the true construction of the deed. It will be observed that the words, \u201csaid premises\u201d are used in every clause of this conveyance; and I think, wherever used, they refer to the same lot or part of a lot, namely, that conveyed by Patrick Brennan 2d to Margaret Brennan, and the next of kin of her husband. Thus, the widow was to take one-half of said premises in fee simple, and moreover such other and further interest, if any, in the remaining half, * \u25a0* * as the said Margaret * * * as widow of the said Patrick Brennan, deceased, would be entitled to, under the law of Illinois, if her husband .had died seized of an unencumbered title, in fee simple, to \u201cthe said premises,\u201d not to the remaining half of said premises.\nNow, had her husband died seized of a fee in the said premises, under the conditions stated, his widow would clearly have been.entitled to one-half of the whole in fee, and'to dower in the other half, under the 46th section of the statute of wills. Such, therefore, must have been the decree of the court, had she applied for a partition during her life time. As she died without making such an application, her right of dower has fallen in, and hence her heirs are entitled to only one-half of the lot, subject to the terms of the will.\nThe second question presents more difficulty. This bequest of money to the executor of Margaret Brennan, to be disposed of for \u201csuch charitable or religious purposes as he might think fit,\u201d seems to have left a discretion in the executor, as to both the objects and the recipients of the bounty. Dunne died, having done nothing whatever towards executing his trust, except to qualify as executor,' and, it is said, to collect and use for his own purposes the personal estate of his testatrix.\nThere is, I think, no doubt that this is a bequest for charittable uses, within the meaning of the statute of Elizabeth, chapter 43, section 4, determining the description of trusts of that nature which the law will countenance and enforce. The uses prescribed by Margaret Brennan\u2019s will are thus stated, \u201cand all the rest and residue of the proceeds of said real estate, is to be given by my executor to such charitable and religious purposes, as he may deem fit.\u201d\nThe uses which are countenanced by the statute of Elizabeth, and which courts of equity are authorized by it to en force as charities, are as follows: \u201cDevises for the relief of aged, impotent and poor people; for the maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers and mariners; for schools of learning, free schools, and scholars at the universities; for repairs of bridges, ports, havens, causeways, churches, seabanks and highways; for education and preferment of orphans, the maintenance of houses of correction, for the marriage of poor maids, \u2019 \u2019 et cetera.\nThe word charitable in the bequest of Margaret Brennan, must be construed to refer, generally, to any of the uses which are defined in this statute, and to none others; and the word religious, as relating especially to one of the uses therein enumerated, namly, repairs of churches, the word \u201crepairs,\u201d doubtless, to receive a liberal construction. So far, then, as the nature of the charities contemplated by the will is concerned, the bequest is not void as contravening that statute.\nNow, will this court award to the administrator of Margaret Brennan de bonis non, a discretion to execute the will in the distribution of this bequest, as he may deem fit ? Such .a course is sanctioned by none of the authorities, and it is \u2022doubtful if such an order was ever made by a court of equity. If the court will not direct the administrator de bonis non to \u2022execute this trust, will it itself attempt it ? Will it, in other \u2022words, provide a scheme of charities to which this bequest shall be applied, instituting inquiries as to the probable direction the deceased executor would have given to the charity, had he lived; or if, despairing of ascertaining precisely the intention of either the donor, or her executor, coming as near to it as may be, thus, as it is called in equity, executing this trust, cy pres?\nThis is one of the most difficult questions in equity jurisprudence. There is no doubt, in general, of the jurisdiction of a court of chancery to enforce trusts for charitable uses. The power was either given, or recognized as existing already, in that court, by the statute 43 Elizabeth, chapter 4 referred \u2022to, which is in force in this state. The better opinion seems to be, that courts of equity always had that power, even before and independently of that statute. See 2 Story, Eq. Jur. sections 1142-1162; 2 Redf. on Wills, 776 and following pages.\nA court will not hesitate to interfere and compel the execution of such a trust, whenever it is clearly expressed in the will; where the trustee is named, or is easily ascertainable; or where the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty are pointed out; but whether, where the persons beneficially interested in the charity are not described, perhaps not even known to the testator, but a discretion to name them, and to determine the proportions in which they shall receive it, has been left to the executor; and, especially, where the executor, as here, has died, without having taken any steps towards executing the trust, the court will then step in to execute it, is a far different question, upon which our American courts have not been agreed.\nIn England, the Lord Chancellor has always had extensive authority in cases of this kind. But in what character has he been understood to act ? Has he, in assuming to exercise that authority, acted in his ordinary capacity as chancellor, or as commissioner of the king, who, as parens patriae, undoubtedly has the power, as a branch of his prerogative, to intervene and name the objects of a charity, in danger of lapsing for want of a trustee, or because of the vagueness of the trust. 4 Kent. Com. 508 and note; 2 Redf. on Wills, 828; Mogridge v. Thackwell, 7 Vesey, Jr., 36. In either of these eases, it would be equally the Lord Chancellor who would intervene; in the one ease, however, in the exercise of his ordinary chancery jurisdiction over trusts, and, in the other, as the agent through whom the king exercises his extraordinary prerogative. In this country the question has been variously decided, according to the views entertained of the nature of the power. Thus, in Saltonstall v. Saunders, 11 Allen (Mass.) 446, the supreme court of Massachusetts assert a jurisdiction over charities almost eo-extensive with that of the chancellor of England. On the other hand in New York, in Williams v. Williams, 4 Selden, 525, 548, it was held, that the courts of equity of that state could only administer such charities as create a trust within the strictly equitable cognizance of such courts. In deciding this case Judge Denio said: \u201cIn that class of cases, therefore, where the gift is so indefinite that it cannot be executed by the court, * * * the claim of the representatives of the donor must prevail over the charity. The reason is, that we have no magistrate clothed with the prerogatives of the crown, and our courts of justice are entrusted only with judicial authority. Where the gift is capable of being executed by a judicial decree, I know of no' reason why the court should refuse to excute it.\u201d He then adds: \u201cMy own opinion is, that the distribution of powers among the great departments of the government which is a fundamental doctrine in the American system, would prohibit the courts from exercising a jurisdiction so purely discretionary.\u201d From this I infer, that in the opinion of Judge Denio, the power in question was a branch of the royal prerogative, not a judicial power, and that consequently it was not inherited by courts of chancery in this country on its separation from Great Britain. The cases on this interesting point are collected and discussed in 2 Story, Eq. Jur., section 1167-1183; 2 Bedf. on Wills, 776 and following pages.\nOur supreme court have not passed, so far as I am aware, upon precisely this question. In Heuser v. Harris, 42 Ill. 425, they indicate, perhaps, the principles upon which they would decide it, were a case to come before them, of which the facts were such as to require an adjudication of it. Judge Breese, in deciding the case, says: \u201cIt is well settled in the English chancery courts, that where money is given to charity generally and indefinitely, without trustees or objects selected, the king, as trustee or parens patriae, will direct a scheme, and where trustees are appointed, the chancellor will direct a scheme for the charity, he having jurisdiction over the trust (Boyle on Charities, 238, 239); and this, when neither trustee nor objects\" are selected.\u201d He adds: \u201cSurely the powers of a court of chancery should extend so far as to supply a trustee to manage a testamentary bequest; and, if it be admitted one could not be elected under this will, a court of chancery to carry out the intention of the testator would, by a liberal intendment, appoint one. Every reasonable act will be done, and the most liberal construction of the will had, by a court of chancery, to aid the beneficiaries, when the intention is plain and undeniable. Hadley v. Hopkins\u2019 Academy, 14 Pick. 240. But without reference to 43 Elizabeth, we think that the innate, inherent jurisdiction of a court of chancery is fully competent to supply defects of this nature.\nBut, it should be observed, it was not necessary to the decision of that case, that the court should consider this question, because there the object of the bequest was certain, as was also the intended recipient of it. The court say: \u201cThe object of this bequest is certain, and so is the recipient, being the school district in which the farm is situated\u201d etc. The only question was whether the school district, of which the boundaries had been changed since the date of the devise, could take the benefit of it.\nOn the whole, admitting that the authorities would warrant the intervention of this court to provide a scheme of charities to carry into effect this will, I have great doubt whether, under the circumstances, it ought to be done. In the first place, the amount left after the payment of the debts of the testatrix, and of the specific legacy of $500, will be but small. Secondly, there is no person or corporation before us claiming the benefit of this bequest; nor is it suggested that any such claimant exists. I doubt if it is my duty to advertise for beneficiaries under the trust, or to presume that it would be thought worth the expense, by any charitable or religious institution, to seek the distribution of this fund in its favor. Finally, the executor having died without naming the donees of the charity, admitting that a mere personal discretion to be exercised by the executor was not intended, and that the bequest has not therefore elapsed, the difficulty seems too formidable of attempting to make a distribution of the fund in accordance with the terms of the will.\nA decree for the partition of the lot between the .parties according to their respective interests, as stated, will therefore be entered, but the court declines to direct the execution of the will so far as relates to the charity."},{"case_name":"The People of the State of Illinois, ex rel.

The judge is empowered to issue a summons, or order in writing, to the child\u2019s father, mother, guardian, or whosoever may have the care of the child, in the order named, and if there be none such, to any person, at his discretion, to appear, at a time and place mentioned, and show cause why the child should not be committed to the \u201c reform school,\u201d and upon return of due service of the summons, an investigation shall be had. The section then directs, \u201c if, upon such examination, such judge shall be of opinion that said boy or girl is a proper subject-for commitment to the reform school, and that his or her moral welfare, and the good of society, require that he or she should be sent to said school for employment, instruction and reformation, he shall so decide, and direct the clerk of the court of which he is judge, to make out a warrant of commitment to said reform school; and such child shall thereupon be committed.\u201d\nSection nine, of the act of 1863, directs, that all persons between six and sixteen years of age, convicted of crime punishable by fine or imprisonment, who, in the opinion of the court, would be proper subjects for commitment, shall be committed to said school.\nSection ten authorizes the confinement of the children, and that they \u201c shall be kept, disciplined, instructed, employed and governed,\u201d until they shall be reformed and discharged, or shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one years; and that the sole authority to discharge shall be in the board of guardians.\nThe warrant of commitment does not indicate that the arrest was made for a criminal offense. Hence, we conclude that it was issued under the general grant of power, to arrest and confine for misfortune.\nThe contingencies enumerated, upon the happening of either of which the power may be exercised, are vagrancy, destitution of proper parental care, mendicancy, ignorance, idleness or vice. Upon proof of any one, the child is deprived of home, and parents, and friends, and confined for more than half of an ordinary life. . It is claimed, that the law is administered for the moral welfare and intellectual improvement of the minor, and the good of society. From the record before us, we know nothing of the management. We are only informed that a father desires the custody of his child; and that he is restrained of his liberty. Therefore, we can only look at the language of the law, and the power granted.\nWhat is proper parental care ? The best and kindest parents would differ, in the attempt to solve the question. Ho two scarcely agree; and when we consider the watchful supervision, which is so unremitting over the domestic affairs of others, the conclusion is forced upon us, that there is not a child in the land who could not be proved, by two or more witnesses, to be in this sad condition. Ignorance, idleness, vice, are relative terms. Ignorance is always preferable to error, but, at most, is only venial. It may be general or it may be limited. Though it is sometimes said, that \u201c idleness is the parent of vice,\u201d yet the former may exist without the latter. It is strictly an abstinence from labor or employment.. If the child perform all its duties to parents and to society, the State has no right to compel it to labor. Vice is a very comprehensive term. Acts, wholly innocent in the estimation of many good men, would, according to the code of ethics of others, show fearful depravity. What is the standard to be ? What extent of enlightenment, what amount of industry, what degree of virtue, will save from the threatened imprisonment ? In our solicitude to form youth for the duties of civil life, we should not forget the rights which inhere both in parents and children. The principle of the absorption of the child in, and its complete subjection to the despotism of, the State, is wholly inadmissible in the modern civilized world.\nThe parent has the right to the care, custody and assistance of his child. The duty to maintain and protect it, is a principle of natural law. He may even justify an assault and battery, in the defense of his children, and uphold them in their law suits. Thus the law recognizes the power of parental affection, and excuses acts which, in the absence of such a relation, would be punished. Another branch of parental duty, strongly inculcated by writers on natural law, is the education of children. To aid in the performance of these duties, and enforce obedience, parents have authority over them. The municipal law should not disturb this relation, except for the strongest reasons. The ease with which it may be disrupted under the laws in question; the slight evidence required, and the informal mode of procedure, make them conflict with the natural right of the parent. Before any abridgment of the right, gross misconduct or almost total unfitness on the part of the parent, should be clearly proved. This power is an emanation from God, and every attempt to infringe upon it, except from dire necessity, should be resisted in all well governed States. \u201c In this country, the hope of the child, in respect to its education and future advancement, is mainly dependent upon the father; for this he struggles and toils through life; the desire of its accomplishment operating as one of the most powerful incentives to industry and thrift. The violent abruption of this relation would not only tend to wither these motives to action, but necessarily, in time, alienate the father\u2019s natural affections.\u201d\nBut even the power of the parent must be exercised with moderation. He may use correction and restraint, but in a reasonable manner. He has the right to enforce only such discipline, as may be necessary to the discharge of his sacred trust; only moderate correction and temporary confinement. We are not governed by the twelve tables, which formed the Homan law. The fourth table gave fathers the power of life and death, and of sale, over their children. In this age and country, such provisions would be atrocious. If a father confined or imprisoned his child for one year, the majesty of the law would frown upon the unnatural act, and every tender mother and kind father would rise up in arms against such monstrous inhumanity. Can the State, as parens patriae, exceed the power of the natural parent, except in punishing crime ?\nThese laws provide for the \u201c safe keeping \u201d of the child; they direct his \u201c commitment,\u201d and only a \u201c ticket of leave,\u201d or the uncontrolled discretion of a board of guardians, will permit the imprisoned boy to breathe the pure air of heaven outside his prison walls, and to feel the instincts of manhood by contact with the busy world. The mittimus terms him \u201c a proper subject for commitment;\u201d directs the superintendent to \u201c take his body,\u201d and the sheriff endorses upon it, \u201c executed by delivering the body of the within named prisoner.\u201d The confinement may be from one to fifteen years, according to the age of the child. Executive clemency can not open the prison doors, for no offense has been committed. The writ of habeas corpus, a writ for the security of liberty, can afford no relief, for the sovereign power of the State, as parens patrice, has determined the imprisonment beyond recall. Such a restraint upon natural liberty is tyranny and oppression. If, without crime, without the conviction of any offense, the children of the State are to be thus confined for the \u201c good of society,\u201d then society had better be reduced to its original elements, and free government acknowledged a failure.\nIn cases of writs of habeas corpus to bring up infants, there are other rights beside the rights of the father. If improperly or illegally restrained, it is our duty, ex debito justifies, to liberate. The welfare and rights of the child are also to be considered. The disability of minors does not make slaves \u2022or criminals of them. They are entitled to legal rights, and are under legal liabilities. An implied contract for necessaries is binding on them. The only act which they are under a legal incapacity to perform, is the appointment of an attorney. All their other acts are merely voidable or confirmable. They are liable for torts, and punishable for crime. Lord Kenyon said, \u201c If an infant commit an assault, or utter slander, God forbid that he should not be answerable for it, in a court of justice.\u201d Every child over ten years of ago may be found guilty of crime. For robbery, burglary or arson, any minor may be sent to the penitentiary. Minors are bound to pay \u2022taxes for the support of the government, and constitute a part of the militia, and are compelled to endure the hardship and privation of a soldier\u2019s life, in defense of the constitution and the laws; and yet it is assumed, that to them, liberty is a mere chimera. It is something of which they may-Lave dreamed, but have never enjoyed the fruition. ^\nCan we hold children responsible for crime; liable for their torts; impose onerous burdens upon them, and yet deprive them of the enjoyment of liberty, without charge or conviction of crime ? The bill of rights declares, that \u201c all men are, by nature, free and independent, and have certain inherent and inalienable rights\u2014among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d This language is not restrictive; it is broad and comprehensive, and declares a grand truth, that \u201c all men,\u201d all people, everywhere, have the inherent and inalienable right to liberty. Shall we say to the children of the State, you shall not enjoy this right\u2014a right independent of all human laws and regulations ? It is declared in the constitution ; is higher than constitution and law, and should be held forever sacred.\nEven criminals can not be convicted and imprisoned without due process of law\u2014without a regular trial, according to the course of the common law. Why should minors be imprisoned for misfortune ? Destitution of proper parental care, ignorance, idleness and vice, are misfortunes, not crimes. In all criminal prosecutions against minors, for grave and heinous offenses, they have the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury. All this must precede the final commitment to prison. Why should children, only guilty of misfortune, be deprived of liberty without \u201c due process of law ?\u201d\nIt can not be said, that in this case, there is no imprisonment. This boy is deprived of a father\u2019s care; bereft of home influences; has no freedom of action; is committed for an uncertain time; is branded as a prisoner; made subject to the will of others, and thus feels that he is a slave. Nothing could more contribute to paralyze the youthful energies, crush all noble aspirations, and unfit him for the duties of manhood. Other means of a milder character; other influences of a more kindly nature; other laws less in restraint of liberty, would better accomplish the reformation of the depraved, and infringe less upon inalienable rights.\nIt is a grave responsibility to pronounce upon the acts of the legislative department. It is, however, the solemn duty of the courts to adjudge the law, and guard, when assailed, the liberty of the citizen. The constitution is the highest law; it commands and protects all. Its declaration of rights is an express limitation of legislative power, and as the laws under which the detention is had, are in conflict with its provisions, we must so declare.\nIt is therefore ordered, that Daniel O\u2019Connell be discharged from custody.\nDischarged.\n*\nSee the case of Fletcher et al. v. The People, holding that the father may be indicted and punished for inhuman treatment of his child."},{"case_name":"VAN EPPS v. WALSH et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6131682\/","date":"1870-12-01","court":"United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of Alabama","content":"WOODS, Circuit Judge.\nOn the 16th day of April, 1861, Abram W. Van Epps was appointed by the probate court of Mobile county'. Alabama, guardian of Barney H. Van Epps, the complainant, and gave bond in the sum of 850,000, with E. S. Dargan, Charles Walsh and others as sureties, conditioned that if the said Abram W. Van Epps should well and truly perform all the duties which might be by law required of him as guardian, then the obligation should be void. Under this appointment the guardian reported that he had received as assets of the estate of his ward the sum of 815.328.89. On the 10th day of November, 1862, on the application of the sureties on the guardian\u2019s bond, Abram W. Van Epps, as guardian, filed an additional bond, in the penalty of \u00a1$50,000, with E. S. Dargan and Charles Walsh as securities, with the same identical condition as the original bond. On the same day, Van Epps executed a deed of mortgage to Dargan and Walsh on certain real estate in the city of Mobile, in which, after a recital that Dargan and Walsh were sureties on his bond as guardian, the purpose and condition of the mortgage are thus set out: \u201cNow the object of this conveyance is to protect and save harmless my said securities on my said bond, and also to secure the said Barney H. Van Epps in all sums of money I may be found indebted to him on a final settlement of my accounts as such guardian, both of which being done, that is, the full protection of my sureties and the payment of all sums to said Barney H. Van Epps, the minor, this conveyance to be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force.\u201d The mortgage further provides, as follows: \u201cIf I die before I make a final settlement of my accounts, or, if living, I make such final settlement and am found in arrear and indebted to said Barney H. Van Epps, the minor, then my said sureties or the survivor of them shall have the right to take possession of said premises and hold them for the purposes aforesaid, and to sell the same a't public auction, and, from the proceeds, first to pay all the sums I may be indebted to said ward, and the residue to pay over to me or my executors and administrators, if I am not then in life.\u201d On the Sth day of March, 1S64, Van Epps resigned his guardianship, and his resignation was accepted by the probate court, and on the same day, Wesley W. Me-Guire was appointed his successor. On the 9th day of March, 1864, Van Epps made a final settlement of his accounts, as guardian, with the probate court of Mobile county, from which it appeared that there was a balance of $15,624.14 as the assets of his ward in his hands. He was directed by the court to pay over to McGuire, his successor, all the assets of his ward, which was done in open court, and the said McGuire acknowledged the receipt thereof. The said sum of $15,-624.14 was paid in Confederate treasury notes and bonds. On the 28th day of December, 1868, the complainant having reached full age, cited McGuire, his second guardian, to a final settlement of his accounts. Both parties were present by themselves and counsel, and a settlement was made, and a balance of $45.56 found in the guardian\u2019s hands, which was paid to complainant, and the receipt thereof acknowledged by complainant in open court, and complainant discharged McGuire from further liability to account for the same. It further appears that, at a partial settlement of the accounts of McGuire with his said ward, made in said probate court, on the 19th of March, 1868, McGuire reported that he had on hand a balance of $11,758.54, Confederate treasury notes, which were declared to be of no value, and for that reason he was allowed a credit for that amount in his account. The assets received by Abram W. Van Epps of his ward's estate were in gold or its equivalent. The Confederate treasury notes and bonds which Van Epps turned over to his successor were, it is claimed, lost to the estate of the ward. After the final settlement of the accounts of Abram TV. Van Epps as guardian, and his discharge by the court on March 9, 1864, Abram W. Van Epps filed a bill in the chancery court of Mobile county against Dargan and Walsh, to compel them to enter satisfaction of said mortgage given to them as aforesaid, which, on the 24th day of February, 1865, the said chancery court decreed to be done, and declared that the mortgage was satisfied and no longer of effect. In obedience to this decree and on the day of its rendition, Dargan .and Walsh entered satisfaction on the margin of the record of said mortgage, in which entry they recite that the satisfaction is entered so far as they have power, and that the same was done in obedience to the decree of court. At the time of the final settlement of the accounts of Van Epps, guardian, by the probate court in March, 1864, and of the decree of the chancery court \u25a0 of Mobile county in \u2022 February, 1S65, Van Epps, the ward, was absent from the state of Alabama and was residing in the state of New York.\nThe object of the bill is to compel Van Epps and his sureties to pay in lawful money the balance found in his hands on March 9. 1S64, and which lie undertook to discharge by the payment of Confederate notes and bonds; that an account may be taken between said Abram W. Van Epps and complainant, and that payment of any balance found due complainant may be enforced out of said mortgaged premises and the said sureties on the bonds of said Abram W. Van Epps. This claim for relief is based on the allegation that the probate court of Mobile county, which on March 9, 1864. assumed to settle the account of Van Epps as guardian, and to discharge him, and the chancery court which declared said mortgage to be satisfied and directed its release, were not legal courts; that they were without authority to make such settlement, discharge and decree, and that the same are therefore null and void. Dar-gan and Walsh, the sureties on both the bonds of Van Epps as guardian, Wesley W. McGuire as administrator of John H. Woodcock, Wm. B. Hayden as guardian of Wm. L. Nunnalee, a lunatic, the said Woodcock and Nunnalee being sureties on the first bond of Van Epps, and Harriet McLean and James McLean, her husband, the said Harriet now claiming to hold the legal title to the premises mortgaged by Van Epps, are the defendants and the only defendants to the bill.\nThe first question which naturally claims the consideration of the court is, whether the relief asked by the bill against the sureties on the bonds of Van Epps, the guardian, can be granted? It is a doctrine so well settled, that the liability of a surety is strictis-simi juris; that he stands upon the letter of his bond; that his obligation is limited by the terms of his bond, as to require no citation of authorities to support it Another rule of law just as well settled is, that the obligation of a- contract is what the parties intended it to mean when they entered into it; what they both understood to be the contract, that is the contract; and to arrive at the understanding of the parties, the courts are authorized to look at the circumstances which surrounded them when they made it.\nKeeping these principles in view, let us look at the surroundings of the parties to the bonds of Van Epps. The court knows as historical facts, that on the 11th day of January, 1861, the state of Alabama, represented in convention, passed an ordinance purporting to dissolve its connection with the Federal Union; that the convention proceeded to organize a state government, which denied and repudiated the authority and laws of the United States, and declared itself to be a state in a government called the Confederate States. It established and put in operation a government for the state of Alabama, which denied and refused all connection with the government of the United States. The officers of the new pretended state government were swdm to support, not the constitution of the United States, but the constitution of a government organized in opposition and in hostility to the United States, called the Confederate States. Before the first of April, 1861, this new government of the state of Alabama had driven out the forces of the United States and seized upon the forts and the arsenal of the United States located within its limits, and held hostile possession thereof. The new authorities of the state, prior to the first of April, 1861, had raised, armed, equipped and drilled troops to resist the power of the United States and to maintain the secession of the state from the Federal Union. All departments of the government under the new order of things were conducted in subservience to the authority of said Confederate States and recognized the new government of the state. After the 1st of February, 1861, no officers of the United States exercised or were permitted to exercise any authority as such in the state of Alabama, but were utterly excluded therefrom by the power of the state as so organized, and of the so called Confederate States of America. Before April, 1861, the Confederate States was fully organized and its government in full operation in and over Alabama and other seceding states, and its seat of government was established in Alabama, with a president and congress, cabinet and judiciary elected or appointed according to its constitution. On the 13th of April, 1861, the Confederate States commenced hostilities against the United States, and on the 15th of April, 1861, war was recognized by the president of the United States as commenced and existing between the United States and Confederate States of which Alabama was one. On the 16th day of April, 1861, not a vestige of the authority of the United States or of the government of the state of Alabama as a member of the Federal Union remained in the state. On that day a judge of the Confederate States was holding office in Mobile, the courts of the states were organized under the authority of the new state government, or acknowledged that authority and stood ready to submit to and enforce its laws. The great mass of the people of the state believed that the dissolution of bonds between Alabama and the Federal Union would be perpetual, and that thenceforth, the state would remain a member of the Confederate States, which was to hold the relation to the United States of enemies in war, in peace, friends.\nIn this condition of affairs the contract of these sureties was made. The obligee of the bond was John H. Hitchcock, probate judge of Mobile county. He had been elected under the old government of Alabama, and his six years\u2019 term was about to expire. He held over after the secession of the state, and served out his term. It cannot be successfully maintained that he was not a judge under the new insurgent government of Alabama. The assumption that he was not leads to consequences so absurd as to make it untenable. What then was the contract of these sureties, as understood by themselves and John H. Hitchcock, the acting probate judge? They agreed that their principal should, as guardian, well and truly perform all the duties which were or might be required of him by law. By what law? Not the law of the displaced government of Alabama, for that had in the contemplation of the parties no force. Nor by the law of the United States, for that was repudiated and could not at the time be enforced in the state. The conclusion is irresistible that their contract was based on and referred to the existing order of things and that the law by which the guardian was to be governed was the then existing law, and such other laws as should be put in force during the continuance of the trust. To suppose that they had any other law in view is too unreasonable a proposition to be for a moment entertained. If Alabama and the other Confederate States had succeeded in achieving permanent secession and independence, can there be a doubt that no question would ever have been raised as to what was meant by this contract? The settlement of the guardian in 1864, would never have been challenged, and it would not have been challenged because it would strike the universal sense that the settlement was binding and valid, and the covenants of the sureties performed. Can it be plausibly argued that because the rebellion and secession proved in 1865 to be a failure, therefore the contract of these sureties made in 1861 and 1862, and which had been fully performed and discharged in 1864 as the parties understood it, was changed, and a different liability raised thereon V We are bound, if the language of the obligation permits, to give such effect to it as the parties, when they made it, intended to give. It is no answer to this, to say that the judge who settled the account of Van Epps in 1864, and discharged him, was not a legal officer. These sureties never agreed that the account should be settled by a lawful probate judge, as that term is now understood. They agreed that the account should be settled under what they understood at the time to be the laws of the state, and by the person who under those laws was performing the duties of probate judge, and whose authority was derived from those laws. These were the laws and these the officers, that without controversy, must have been in their contemplation when the bond was executed. Suppose that the condition of the bond had been that the guardian should settle his trust to the approval and satisfaction of the chamber of commerce of the city of Mobile, and that such settlement had been made, and the condition of the bond according to its terms complied with. These sureties would not be liable on the bond, because the chamber of commerce was not a court, and had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the settlement, for they had fulfilled precisely what they agreed to do. In either of the cases supposed, namely, the success of the rebellion after the settlement of the guardian with the acting probate judge, or the giving of the bond that the guardian should account with the chamber of commerce, the conditions of the bond being performed according to the intention of the parties, no suit at law could be maintained on the bond. The plea of covenants performed would be a complete bar to such action. But secession failed; the insurgent government of Alabama, more than a year after the final settlement of the guardian\u2019s accounts with his ward had been made by the acting probate judge, in accordance with the laws the parties to the bond had in view, was overthrown, and the old government restored. It is now sought by this bill to mate a new contract for these sureties; a contract which in all probability never entered their minds when they became sureties, to wit, that having discharged their contract according to the laws in their contemplation when they made it, they are to stand bound until their principal accounts according to the laws of the restored governments, state and national. They stand upon the terms of their bond as contemplated at the time by all parties; they have the right to say that their contract shall not be extended the division of a hair; they say they have performed their covenant according to its true interpretation, and that no action can be maintained upon it, and we think the position is impregnable. There is no equity against a surety. If at law he is released, he is released altogether.\nWhen a court has no power to appoint a guardian, but does appoint him, and he gives bond with sureties, and takes possession of the estate of his ward, it is not competent for any of the obligors in such bond to object to its validity on the ground of want of power in the court to make the appointment. Iredell v. Barbee, 9 Ired. 250. While we recognize this doctrine, and hold the sureties concluded by a bond taken by a court not authorized to take it, still we can not enlarge the liabilities of the bond, change its terms, or extend its meaning beyond the fair in-tendment of the parties. In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. [74 U. S.] 733, the supreme court uses this language: \u201cIt is a historical fact that the government of Texas then in full control of the state, was its only actual government, and certainly if Texas had been a separate state, and not one of the United States, the new government having displaced the regular authority, and having established itself in the customary seats of power and in the exercise of the ordinary functions of administration, would have constituted in the strict., est sense of the words a de facto government, and its acts during the period of its existence as such would be effectual and in almost all respects valid. And to some extent this is true of the actual government of Texas, though unlawful and revolutionary as to the United States. It is not necessary to attempt any exact definitions within which the acts of such a state government must be treated as valid or invalid. It may be said perhaps with sufficient accuracy that acts necessary to peace and good order among citizens, such for example as acts sanctioning and protecting marriage and the domestic relations governing the course of descents, regulating the conveyance and transfer of property, real and personal, and providing remedies for injuries to person and estate, and other similar acts which would be valid when proceeding from a lawful government, must be regarded in general as valid, though proceeding from an actual though unlawful government; and that acts in furtherance and support of rebellion against the United States, or intended to defeat the just rights of citizens, and other acts of like nature, must in general be regarded as invalid and void.\u201d When, therefore, the actual existing government of Alabama, on the I6th of April, 1S61, undertook, by its officers, to appoint a guardian for the estate of an infant situate within its territory, it was doing as parens patriae, an act as valid and lawful as if done by a government de jure, and pro hac vice, was in effect a lawful government. Neither it nor its officers can be called to account for discharging a lawful duty. If the state as parens patriae undertakes the duty of caring for an infant\u2019s estate, it alone can be allowed to prescribe how that trust shall be discharged, and can be called to account by no other power or person so long as its acts are not in furtherance and support of rebellion against the rightful government, or intended to defeat the just rights of citizens. On this branch of the case, therefore, X am of opinion that a probate judge of the insurgent government of Alabama might lawfully appoint a guardian for an infant\u2019s estate within its territory, and take bond for the faithful discharge of the trust by the guardian; that the bond is valid, and that, to this extent, the acts of such officer or the government under which he acts cannot be called in question. Further, that such bond must be construed, so far as sureties are concerned, according to the laws of the revolutionary government, and according to the understanding of both obligors and obligees at time of its execution.\nThe result of these views is, that the bonds of Van Epps, as guardian, are valid; that the guardian, having performed his duty' according to the laws of the government in force when the bond was executed and the settlement of the guardian made, and as the parties to the bond understood he was to do, the sureties have performed their covenant and arc discharged from further liability, and, as to them, the bill must be dismissed. Let it be understood, however, that the sureties are relieved solely upon the ground that they have performed their contract as they understood it, and as the state, as parens patriae, acting by its officer, understood it at the time it was made. But, while the sureties on the bond are discharged, it does not follow that tlie guardian is clear of liability. By the reception of the property of his ward, he incurred liabilities independent of any bond, and which would attach to him without bond, and which attach to him independent of his relationship as guardian. This obligation was to improve the estate of his ward and to account for and pay it over to his ward with its increase and profits. He can be relieved from this obligation in one only of two ways, namely, by the full performance of the obligation, or by his discharge therefrom by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to act in the premises, and whose findings and decrees are valid. When the guardian relies upon the decree of the court of a revolutionary and insurgent government for his discharge, it must appear that its proceedings were not in support of the rebellion against the lawful government, or intended to defeat the just rights of citizens. The act of the revolutionary legislature of Alabama, passed December 5. 1861. authorizing guardians and other trustees to purchase bonds of the Confederate States, or of the state of Alabama, or to receive their notes in payment of any debts due the ward, was an act in furtherance of the rebellion, and therefore void; it gave no authority to guardians to purchase such bonds, and the decree of any probate court allowing a guardian a credit for such notes or bonds, was of effect to defeat the just rights of a citizen, to wit, the ward, and was of no binding force on him. and did not operate to discharge the guardian. The court, in attempting to make such a settlement, was no court, and its decree no decree. The decree of the chancery court of Mobile county, directing Dargan and Walsh to enter satisfaction of the mortgage made to them by Van Epps, the guardian, was also made coram non judice. The main party in interest was the minor Van Epps, who was in the state of New York, and prohibited by the laws of the United States from making any defense. It is not pretended that any actual notice was served, or could be legally served upon him. and. even if served, he could make no defense, and the purpose of the decree against him was to deprive him of the security which his guardian had given him to protect his estate. It was a decree depriving him of his just rights, and, in rendering it, the court was no court, and the decree ineffectual. Cuyler v. Ferrill [Case No. 3,523]; Buchanan v. Rucker, 9 East, 191; Borden v. Fitch, 15 Johns. 121; Newdigate v. Davy, 1 Ld. Raym. 742. We have therefore arrived at these further conclusions, that the payment in confederate notes and bonds, of the balance found due by the probate court of Mobile county from Van Epps as guardian, was not binding on his ward, the complainant, nor was the decree of the chancery court of Mobile county, directing the release of the mortgage given by Van Epps, binding on the ward, so that the ward has a just claim against his guardian for so much of his estate as was converted into confederate notes and bonds, and paid over to McGuire, the second guardian.\nIt has been repeatedly held by the supreme court of Alabama, that all judgments rendered by the revolutionary state courts of Alabama are void. Ex parte Bibb, 44 Ala. 140; Noble v. Cullom, Id. 554. And in the case of Bibb, the court held that the ordinance of the convention, No. 26, of 1865, dated September 12, 1865, purporting to 'ratify such judgments, was illegal and void. While unwilling to accept this doctrine in the broad terms laid down by the supreme court of this state, yet I am of opinion, as already expressed. that where the judgments of the courts gave effect to the legislation of the revolutionary legislatures, which was enacted for the purpose of aiding the rebellion or deprived citizens of the United States of their just rights, such judgments and decrees are void, and no subsequent legislation can make them good. The settlement of the probate court in 1864, being void as well as the decree of the chancery court, no direct proceeding is necessary to set them aside or reverse them. They are nullities so far as they undertake to conclude the rights of complainant against his guardian, and a bill in equity in this court is a proper method for enforcing these rights. The complainant having then a just claim on Van Epps, his guardian, and the release of the mortgage given by him to Dargan and Walsh being void, it remains to consider what, if any, are the rights of complainant under that mortgage. The settlement made by Van Epps, the guardian, with the probate court on March 9, 1864, shows that he had in his hands, of his ward\u2019s money, $15,724.14. That is the balance, as struck by the probate judge. The payment of this sum or any part of it in Confederate notes or bonds was no payment. Per Walker, C. J., in Shackleford v. Cunningham, 41 Ala. 205. Now, what is the purpose of the mortgage given by Van Epps to Dargan and Walsh, as expressed in the instrument itself? It is not only to indemnify them, as his sureties, but to secure Barney H. Van Epps in all sums of money he, the guardian, might be found indebted to him on a final settlement of his accounts as guardian, and the mortgage provided, that if the mortgagor died, before final settlement, or if living, made such settlement, and was found indebted, and in arrear to his ward, the mortgagees might sell the mortgaged property and pay such indebtedness. This makes Dargan and Walsh trustees for the benefit of the minor, and as such trustees, they have a mortgage lien for the benefit of complainant on the premises, to secure him in the amount due from his guardian.\nIf the views we have expressed are correct, McLean and wife cannot be innocent. purchasers of the mortgaged property, for the mortgage remains of record without any valid release, and that is constructive notice to them. Before, however, any decree could be made by this court, by which the lien of the complainant could be enforced on the mortgaged premises. Abram W. Van Epps must necessarily be made a party. No such decree could be made which would not directly affect him. Being a nonresident he cannot be made a party. By reason of this deficiency in the jurisdiction of this court, I am unable to see how any relief can be given complainant as against Abram W. Van Epps and the mortgaged property. The bill must, therefore, be dismissed as to Dargan and Walsh and the other sureties on the bonds of Van Epps, and as to McLean and wife and Dargan and Walsh, as trustees under the mortgage, the bill is dismissed without prejudice. Decree accordingly."},{"case_name":"Elwyn\u2019s Appeal. Dallas\u2019s Estate","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1022614\/","date":"1871-02-27","court":"Supreme Court of Pennsylvania","content":"The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Agnew, J.\nWe think this case is governed by the Act of 13th June 1836, relating to lunatics. The 20th and 21st sections direct that the committee^shall have the management of the real and personal estate of the lunatic, and shall from time to time apply so much of the income thereof as shall be necessary to the payment of his just debts and engagements, and the support and maintenance of himself and his family, and the education of his minor children; and if the income be not sufficient, shall under the directions of the court, apply so much of the principal of his personal estate as shall be necessary for the purpose. The distribution of the surplus of $161.22 therefore did no more than the law allows.\nIt may be admitted that the .half-pay of an officer of the government is not liable to be taken by creditors under any form of process \u2014 by levy, sale, attachment or sequestration. The authorities cited are to this effect. Being intended as a means of subsistence, it will not be permitted to be diverted. Like the provision of a parent in the hands of a trustee for a minor or lunatic child, it cannot be intercepted by others. But when the half-pay has reached the beneficiary, and has lost its distinctive character, and when as money it is in a proper sense, as here, a distributable fund lying in the hands of the law, it is to be governed by the direction of the law. Consequently a surplus not needed for the prime purpose of subsistence (as is found here) may be applied with the sanction of the court, which has the custody of the lunatic, to the payment of his debts. There is nothing which would prevent the lunatic himself from so doing, were he in his sound mind. His future pay may not be alienated by assignment, as it certainly cannot be intercepted by creditors in invitum, but money in possession may be disposed of at his will. Why then should the court be disabled, after a sufficient provision made for him, from ordering payment of a surplus to a just debt? The sum allowed for the support of his sister, who is not of his family, but for whom h\u00e9 himself had provided, would be liable to a similar objection, and yet it was not excepted to by the committee. Of course we are to presume from the finding of the auditor and the approval of the court,'that these sums were in excess of the provision necessary for the lunatic; otherwise the court looking to the source of the income as half-pay, and as a provision made by the parens patriae for the officer\u2019s maintenance, would not allow its diversion to the prejudice of the lunatic. The same reasons dispose of the claim set up under the $300 law. The allowance to the creditor here is the act of the court by the hands of its committee; and not a seizure by adverse process. The decree of the Court of Common Pleas is affirmed and the costs ordered to be paid out of the estate."},{"case_name":"THE PARSEE MERCHANT\u2019S CASE","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1968731\/","date":"1871-10-01","court":"New York Court of Common Pleas","content":"Chas.

In the year 1870, he left Bombay, taking with him personal property, in money and securities to the value of more than $100,-000, being all the property he possessed, and went to Calcutta, whence he proceeded to Europe, and in May, 1870, came to this city.\nUpon his arrival here, he put up at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and shortly afterwards circulated a business card describing himself as an \u201c Indiaman, a Parsee,\u201d and \u201c New York Merchant,\u201d and giving as Ms address, Room 45, Fifth Avenue Hotel.\nFrom this hotel he removed in a short time to the Hoffman House, in this city, and it being apparent very soon after that he was insane, he was taken charge of by the police authorities and placed in the hospital at Bellevue.\nAs he was a total stranger, there being no one here who knew anything about him, and as he was supposed, from his description of himself as \u00a3\u00a3a Parsee Merchant,\u201d and an \u201cIndiaman,\u201d to be a British subject, Her Britannic Majesty\u2019s Vice-Consul in this city, J. Pierrepont Edwards, Esq., applied to this court for a commission of lunacy, and for the appointment of a committee to take charge of Ms person and of his estate.\nA writ de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo having been granted, and it appearing upon inquisition that he was a lunatic, and had personal property in this city, proved upon the inquest to be about $40,000, the care of his person was committed to Conner Jones, Esq., and of his estate to\" Nathaniel Jarvis, Jr., Esq. Upon the appointment of a committee of his person, Colah was transferred from the Bellevue hospital, to a private lunatic asylum, at Fishkill, and it subsequently appearing that Major A. Gk Constable had, from motives of humanity, taken a very active interest in his case, that that gentleman had been for some years a resident of Bombay, was familiar with the religious views, usages and peculiarities of the Farsees, and could communicate with Colah in Mahratta, the only tongue in which he can or will converse since his insanity, it was deemed judicious by the court to transfer the future custody and care of him to Major Constable, by whom he was afterwards removed to the insane asylum at Flushing, where he is now under medical care and treatment.\nIt appeared upon the inquisition, as I have stated, that he had property amounting to forty thousand dollars ; but after Mr. Jarvis was appointed the committee of the estate, he found among his effects, in addition to the property already known to belong to him, a bill of lading for a large shipment of gold to this country, and with great difficulty and after many and diligent efforts, Mr. Jarvis traced this property into the possession of one of the proprietors of the Hoffman House ; the boxes containing the gold having in the meanwhile been opened, the gold sold, and the proceeds, amounting to sixty-four thousand dollars in currency, deposited in a trust company in this city, to the credit of the person by whom it was withheld, and who, by a resort to legal proceedings, was subsequently compelled to give it up.\nThis sum and one thousand dollars in gold in addition thereto, together with the property found upon the inquisition, amounting in all to one hundred and five thousand dollars, has been securely invested by Mr. Jarvis, under the direction of the court, in bonds and mortgages upon real estate and other securities bearing an annual interest of seven per cent., and an action brought by him is now pending, to recover the difference between the market value of the gold at the time when it was sold, and United States currency, which, if successful, may add about eight thousand dollars more to the estate.\nColah having described himself as a Farsee merchant, Mr. Jarvis caused inquiries to be made of some Farsee merchants doing business in London, and through that channel discovered that he was a native of and had came from Bombay; whereupon Mr. Edwards, the vice-consul, caused further inquiries to be made in Bombay, which resulted in the discovery of his family and relatives, to whom he communicated a knowledge of his situation.\nAfter receiving this information, two of his brothers and his wife united in and transmitted to Mr. Edwards a general power of attorney, authorizing him to take charge of Colah\u2019s person and estate; under which, however, no action was taken by that gentleman until he received, through the American consul at Bombay, a communication from Heera Baee, the wife, requesting him to apply to this court, on her behalf, for the allowance of a certain sum to meet her present expenses, and for a fixed sum annually thereafter for the support of herself and children. This application having been heard, the court made the usual order for a reference, which is still pending, a commission having been despatched to Bombay that the court might have legal evidence of the necessary facts and such information as would enable it to fix upon a proper allowance; which commission has not yet been returned.\nFending this inquiry, Framjee Dosabhoy C. Wadia, the father-in-law of Colah, arrived in this city from Bombay, with a power of attorney from Heera Baee, the wife, authorizing him, on her behalf, to take charge of the person and property of the lunatic, to bring him and it to Bombay, and to make such application for that purpose, in her name, as might be necessary. Mr. Wadia accordingly presented a petition in her name, asking that the person of Colah might be placed in his charge, and that the money, securities and other property belonging to Colah should be delivered up to him as the authorized agent and attorney of Heera Baee.\nThe application for the delivery of the property was opposed by the British vice consul, through his counsel, who read a formal protest, made by the two brothers of Colah before a notary in Bombay, to the effect that Mr. Wadia was not a proper person with whom to intrust either the person or the property.\nThe application to place the property in the hands of Mr. Wadia was denied, for reasons which have already been assigned, but the application to transfer Colah from the jurisdiction of this court rests upon entirely different grounds, which, as set up in the petition, are substantially these:\n1. That his entire life, before he quitted Bombay, had been passed in that place; that he, all his relations and nearly a11 his connections and friends are Farsees, whose religious habits and customs are totally different from those of the people of the United States ; that there are no Farsees resident in this city, nor\" any priest or minister of that religion in this country, and that in the event of his decease here, his remains would be deprived of the performance of certain rites and ceremonies which are deemed essential and vital by all persons of the religious faith in which he has been educated and has always professed.\n2. That the difference between this climate and that of Bombay, and the difference in diet and the mode of living are unfavorable to his health, and have a prejudicial effect upon his mental condition.\n3. That he has ceased to be violent or dangerous, and is now quiet and easily managed ; that he rarely speaks or takes notice of or exhibits any interest in what is passing around him ; that it is very difficult to arouse his attention, and that the only hope of restor ing him lies in Ms return to his native country, the society and care of his wife, the presence of his children and the renewal of former associations with relations and friends in the scenes to which he has been accustomed from his infancy.\nThe first of these grounds, the importance in the religious belief of the Farsees of certain rites and ceremonies over the body after death, was denied by Major Constable, who testified that he was well acquainted with the religious faith, usages, ceremonials and practices of that people.\nBut the other grounds for the removal were supported by the opinions of Doctors Hammond and Vance, two prominent physicians in this city in the specialty of mental diseases.\nDr. Vance, after an account in detail of Ms condition, expresses the general opinion that Ms case did not require the restraints of an asylum; that his chance of ultimate recovery would be materially increased by his removal therefrom, and that no measure of a sanitary nature could be more appropriate than a return to his friends and the familiar. surroundings of Ms native country.\nDr. Hammond was of opinion that a sea voyage would be highly beneficial, and he declared that he could conceive of no cause so likely to prove injurious to him as his present separation from Ms family and country. Dr. Barstow, the resident physician of the asylum at Flushing, however, testified that in addition to the loss of his reason, he was afflicted with certain physical diseases of a very delicate and painful character, which, in his opinion, would be materially aggravated by his removal to Bombay and exposure to that climate. This conflict of opinion being unsatisfactory, I directed, with a view of obtaining something more definite and certain, that Dr. J. Meredith Clymer, a prominent practitioner in the specialty of mental diseases, and Dr. A. G-escheidt, a general physician of high standing and long experience in this city, should be added to the three gentlemen above-named, and that the five together should examine Colah at the asylum, and after consultation, report in writing, whether in their judgment, his removal to Bombay would aid in the recovery of his health, the restoration of his mind, or promote his physical comfort and well being.\nThis examination and consultation was had, and the five physicians have unanimously reported that in their opinion, his removal to Bombay will not prove injurious to his physical or mental health, and in case he is properly attended, that it would be a very expedient measure.\nEach physician, moreover, as required by the order which I made, gave his reasons in writing for his individual opinion, and the reasons given are, in my judgment, in the highest degree satisfactory.\nIt remains, then, to determine whether, this court has the power to direct the removal of Colah to a place beyond the limits of its own jurisdiction, a question that involves an inquiry into the nature and the extent of the authority vested in the court in cases of this description.\nThe jurisdiction assumed to be inherent in a State over that unfortunate class of persons within its limits, who are deprived of the use of their mental faculties, may be said to rest upon two grounds\u2014First: Its duty to protect the community from the acts of those who are not under the guidance of reason; and, secondly, its duty to protect them,- as a class incapable of protecting themselves, which has its foundation in the reciprocal obligations of allegiance and protection, which extends to aliens and strangers who, while they are within the limits of a State, are under the obligations of a temporary and local allegiance, and are entitled to its protection (1 Blacks. Com., 370; Cockb. on Nationality, 139; Case of the Princess Bariatinsky, 1 Ph., 375; Highmore on Lunacy, 18; Powell on Legeance and Protection, 169, 205).\nIn England^ whence onr law respecting idiots and lunatics is derived, the custody and care of this class of persons and their property is a part of the prerogative of the sovereign. Anciently, by the common law, it was intrusted to tutors, or more properly, curators, the curator being either the feudal lord or the next of kin, who in the case of an idiot, as his disability was permanent, took his land and the profits as the next in succession, subject to the obligation of supporting him during his life; but in the case of a lunatic, who may be restored to his reason, the curator simply had the custody of the estate under the obligation of applying the profits to his support, \u00e1nd retaining the excess that it might, together with the estate, be restored to him if he recovered his reason, and if not, that it might be secured to his heirs (Bracton, lib. 1, cap. 10, lib. 5, ch. 20 ; Fleta, lib.1, cap. 11, \u00a710, p. 6; Mirror of Justices, 46, 74, 98, 123, 130; Year Books, 32 Edw. I., 272 ; Beverly\u2019s Case, 4 Coke, 127; 1 Blacks. Com., 302; Fitz N. B., 232; Shep. Ct. Keeper, c. 22, 172; Bac.

(17 Edw. II., c. 9, 10), it was placed amongst the king\u2019s prerogatives ; that statute declaring that the king should have the custody of the lands of \u201cnatural fools,\u201d and the profits, with the obligation of maintaining them, and that with respect to those who had had \u201c their wit and memory,\u201d but had lost it, that the king should provide that their lands should be safely kept; that they and their households should be maintained out of the profits of their estates, and that the residue should be kept to their use, to be delivered to them when they came to \u201c their right minda jurisdiction or power which was not, as has been supposed, derived from the statute, but rests on the broader ground of the duty of a sovereign, as parens patries, to take care of those who, by reason of their imbecility or want of understanding, .are incapable of taking care of themselves, a principle introduced into the common law at a very early period from the Roman law of the twelve tables; Inst. B., tit. 1, 23, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4 ; Dig., 27, 10,1, 67 ; Maynz Elements du Droit Romain, tom. 1, \u00a7 106; Ortolan's generalisation du Droit Romain, 94, 95, 96, 97; Shep. Abm., part 3, p. 71; and which, upon the authority of Seeded, was one of the liberties and privileges secured by Magna Charta. (Bacon's Discourse on Selden's Notes, p. 176, 5 m).\nThis duty was first discharged by the king\u2019s committing the custody of such persons and of their estates to proper committees in each, particular case ; but it was afterwards transferred to the lord chancellor, not in his capacity as chancellor, or as a part of his equitable jurisdiction, but as the king\u2019s delegate in the exercise of this special jurisdiction (Fleta, p. 6; Reeves\u2019 History of English Law, by Finlason, V. 2, C. 12, p. 193, and note a; Slaunf. Pr. Reg., 33; 1 Blacks. Com., 303 ; 3 Id., 427 ; Matter of Hele, 3 Atk., 635 ; Exp. Phillips, 19 Ves., 118, 122).\nAnd the exercise of it in England, through many centuries, has resulted in the formation of a body of precedents and rules constituting a distinct branch of jurisprudence.\nSo much of the law as formed a part of the king\u2019s prerogative and was applicable under our republican form of government was, upon our separation from Great Britain at the revolution, vested in the people, and this especial jurisdiction was, in this State, by legislative enactments, transferred to certain judicial tribunals that have administered it in accordance with the rules and principles which the course of experience in England has pointed out as the most just, practicable and judicious.\nThis court has been one of those designated tribunals since 1854, having committed to it by statute the \u201c care and custody of the person and estate of a lunatic or person of unsound mind\u201d when he resides in the city and county of New York (Code of Procedure, \u00a7 30 ; Laws of 1854, p. 464, \u00a7 6), an authority that carried with it all the power that was exercised in such cases by the lord chancellor in Great Britain, or by the court of chancery in this State, when this jurisdiction was entrusted exclusively to that tribunal. Justice Hab\u00e9is has said, in John Mason\u2019s Case, 1 Barb., 436, 441, that, as our statute has conferred this jurisdiction \u201c without restriction or limitation, the manner in which the control thus given is to be exercised by the court is entirely a matter of discretion.\u201d Which, however, must be understood with this qualification, that it is a discretion regulated and restricted by certain rules and principles that have always been acted upon both in this country and in England.\nIt may be said in general terms, in relation to the nature and \u2022 extent of this jurisdiction, that the care and custody of a lunatic and of his estate necessarily imply both the right and the duty on the part of the court to do in respect to either whatever is most con ducive to his interest. To see, in respect to his person, that he is maintained as comfortably as his unfortunate situation will admit of and his pecuniary resources will allow; that every thing is done that can be done by care, skill and,medical treatment to promote his. general health, or which will or may contribute to the restoration of his reason. His interest is the chief consideration, and, therefore, great care has always been taken not to intrust the custody of his person or his estate to those who may be pecuniarily benefited by his death, or whose interest it is to keep his property from diminishing, unless the officer exercising the power is satisfied that it would be to the .advantage of his bodily and mental condition, that those who stand in the relation to him of blood and natural affection should have the custody and care of him. \u00a1Nor will the interest of heirs or next of kin be at all considered in any outlay that may be made for his comfort or benefit or in determining what is most conducive,to his interest, either in the care of his' person or in the management of his estate.\n\u201cThe king,\u201d said Lord Hardwicke in Roberts\u2019 Case (3 Atk., 309), \u201cis quasi, a trustee for the lunatic\u2019s benefit only.\u201d Lord Macclesfield declared that in the eye of the-law, a lunatic is never looked upon-as beyond the possibility of recovery, and added, \u201cIt is his benefit and comfort I am to take care of, and not to heap up wealth for the benefit of his administrator or next of kin\u201d (Dormer\u2019s Case, 2 P. Wms., 265).\nAnd Lord Nobtbington afterwards declared that, \u201cIn the management of the lunatic\u2019s estate, the ruling principle is to do what is for the benefit of the lunatic\u201d (Exp. Grimstone, Amb., 708).\nLord Loughborough, in adverting to the precedents and orders of previous chancellors in the exercise of this delicate jurisdiction, said that there was one pervading principle, which, was that the trust was administered solely in the interest of the lunatic himself, that nothing could be more mischievous than to consider how his successor might \u2022 be affected by what was done, and that the chancellors had always shut out of their view all consideration Of eventual interests, and considered only the interest of the person under their care (Oxenden v. Lord Compton, 2 Ves. Jr., 72).\n\u201cA lunatic,\u201d says Lord Eldon, in Chumley\u2019s Case (1 Ves. Jr., 296), \u201cis to have every comfort that his circumstances will admit of.\u201d And he said in another case (Exp. Whitehead, 2 Meriv., 99), \u201cthe court has nothing to consider but the situation of the lunatic himself, always looking to the probability of his recovery, and never regarding the interest of the next of kin. . . The court does nothing wantonly or unnecessarily to alter the lunatic\u2019s property ; but, on the contrary, takes care of it for his sake, that if he recover, he shall find his estate as nearly as possible in the same condition as he left it, applying the property in the mean time, as the court thinks it would have been wise and prudent in the lunatic himself to apply it, if he had been capable.\u201d To which I may add the observation of Chancellor Kent, in Eunice Salisbury\u2019s Case (3 Johns. Ch., 347), that \u201cthe governing principle in the management of the estate, is the lunatic\u2019s interest, not that of those who may have eventual righ ts of succession\u201d (See, also, Matter of Livingston, 1 Johns. Ch., 436; Matter of Taylor, 9 Paige, 611; Matter of Willoughby, 11 Id., 257 ; Matter of Heeney, 2 Barb. Ch., 326 ; Shep. Abm., pt. 3, p. 71).\n. I have referred to the authority of these eminent judges, in the exposition of the nature of this jurisdiction, and of the principles which govern in the exercise of it, because it indicates the extent of the power with which the court, is clothed, and because what I am asked to do involves a very heavy expenditure and charge upon the lunatic\u2019s estate, which I should not impose unless it be clear that I have the power to do so, and that it is necessary for his benefit.\nActing upon the general principle, that the. court is empowered to do whatever is best for the lunatic himself, without any regard to the effect it may have upon the ultimate interests of others, it becomes very plain to my mind, that if the removal of him to a place beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the court is, as a sanitary measure, essential to him and for his benefit, it is competent for the court to direct it to be done, and so far as it has the means, to see that it is carried out. It is true, that the custody of a lunatic is always given by the court to a committee, and that when this committee goes with his charge beyond the jurisdiction of the court, it has no longer any power or control over either ; but this does not constitute a sufficient reason for keeping the lunatic within the court\u2019s territorial limits, when, in the opinion of those who are most competent to judge, the effect of so doing is prejudicial to his health, and tends to lessen the chances of his recovery. The court is to do what is for his benefit, and when it has taken every precaution, in seeing that he is entrusted to the charge of a person who, in the judgment of the court, will faithfully execute the trust committed to him, by taking the lunatic to the designated place, and who will fulfill every instruction given, for the faithful discharge of that delicate duty, the court does what it ought to do under the circumstances, and in.so doing, but carries out the philanthropic purpose which lies at the very foundation of the jurisdiction which it consents to give up.\nI do not find in the reports any adjudged case covering the precise point here presented. In Re Hackett (3 Irish Ch., 375), the lunatic was transferred from Ireland to England. It was beyond the jurisdiction of the chancellor having custody of his person, but the jurisdiction of each chancellor was a part of the prerogative of the same sovereign. In the Matter of Houston (1 Russ., 311), the lunatic was brought by his committee from Jamaica to England, for the benefit of his health, but by what authority is not stated, the only point in the case being whether another commission was necessary in England, which the court held was necessary. In Briggs v. Terry (Mylne & C., 675), an infant ward of the court of chancery was allowed, upon application, to go to France to see his father, in the custody of a person giving security that he would bring him back within a given period; and in Re Jones (1 Pr., 461, leave was given for a lunatic, under particular circumstances, to reside in Scotland, his committee, who resided in England, undertaking to bring him within the jurisdiction of the court whenever required.\nAlthough these cases have some bearing upon the question before me, they are not precisely analogous, but there is an unreported case exactly in point, of which I have been advised by W. W. Yan Wagener, Esq., the professional gentleman by whom it was instituted. In the year 1840, John Grravillon, a well-known wealthy French merchant in this city and an alien, became insane, and was placed in the asylum at Bloomingdale. A commission of lunacy having been granted and a committee of his person and estate appointed, the committee, upon a certificate of the resident physician of the asylum, that an improvement of Mr. Grravillon\u2019s general health might be expected from a sea voyage, applied to Yice-Chancellor McCoim for authority to send him to France in charge of a physician and two nurses, and to place him in a maison de sanie in Paris. The application was granted. He was taken to France and placed in an institution in Paris, where he died two years after- wards, and the expense incurred was paid out of his estate.\nMy conclusion, after this review of the law is, that I have the power; and in respect to the expedience and necessity of its exercise, I regard the opinions of the five physicians as conclusive.\nThe views of Drs. Hammond and Vance have already been sufficiently stated. Dr. Clymer reports, that the unsoundness of mind with which Colah is affected is not of a kind to be aggravated by a voyage to Bombay, if he is properly cared for and attend ed during the voyage ; that there is a possibility of improvement of his disorder by a return to his own country, where he will be amongst friends and those of similar habits, language and religion, and that there is a lunatic asylum at Bombay which the doctor believes, from common report, to be equal to those in this country, and where Colah can be treated by equally skillful physicians ; in which report of Dr. Clymer Dr. Grescheidt fully concurs; and the resident physician of the'asylum, Dr. Barstow, is of the opinion, that if the same daily care and supervision can be continued during the journey, and the same relief and protection afforded him that he has hitherto received, the journey may be safely and advantageously accomplished.\nMajor Constable having consented to take charge of him, my instructions are that he shall take him by the next steamer which leaves here, to connect with a \u2022 steamer on the Pacific, to San Francisco. That from San Francisco he shall take him by steamer to Hong Kong, and from thence by steamer to Bombay, and upon his arrival at Bombay, place him in the institution referred to by Dr. Clymer. That the nurse that has hitherto had charge of him at the institution, at Flushing, shall go with him and continue the same care and attention he has hitherto bestowed, until he is placed in the institution in Bombay. It is suggested in a letter of Dr. Barstow to Major Constable, that he should be accompanied by Dr. J. C. Godfrey, an assistant physician of the Flushing Institution. This will involve a heavy additional expense, amounting, upon the estimate made, to over four thousand dollars. I hesitate to subject the estate to this charge, it being my impression, that the services of an attending physician can be necessary during this journey only in view of Colah\u2019s bodily ailments, and as there is a physician attached to each of the steamers, throughout the .entire route, he will have the benefit of their medical aid, which, in connection with the experience of the nurse, who has had him in charge for some time, and the supervision of the very intelligent gentle-who goes out as his committee, will, it appears to me, be sufficient to secure his safe transit from here to Bombay. That will itself involve a very heavy expense, to which must be added the remuneration of the various counsel, who have appeared in this proceeding, either on behalf of the British consul, the committees, or the wife in making this application. It may be, however, that I am mistaken in this matter, and that an accompanying physician is indispensable. If the five medical gentlemen, therefore, who have heretofore acted, will certify to me in writing, that it would not be safe to trust to the physicians attached to the steamers, and that, in their judgment, an accompanying physician is requisite, it will be so ordered.\nMajor Constable, upon his arrival in Bombay, will immediately notify the wife and relatives of the presence there of Colah, and if they, or some one of them, do not apply for the appointment of a committee, at the earliest possible period, then Major Constable is instructed to make the application himself, to the proper judicial tribunal or judge, within the jurisdiction, and will bring back with him, duly authenticated evidence of the appointment, and of the asylum or institution in which Colah is placed.\nIf such an event should happen as the death of Colah, during the journey, then after discharging the last duties to his remains, Major Constable and the nurse will proceed no farther, but return to this city, and upon Major Cons'able\u2019s return, he will make an official report, as a committee, of all that he has done.\nThe committee of the estate will be directed to pay out such sums as may be subsequently directed by order, to defray the expenses of the journey from here to Bombay, and upon Major Constable\u2019s return, the court will adjust and fix upon a proper sum, to be paid to him out of the estate, for the discharge of this trust, which will not be regulated by the commissions given by Revised Statutes, to executors, administrators, or guardians (2 Rev. Stat., 93, \u00a7 58), as is the rule in committees of the estate (Matter of Livingston, 2 Den., 575; S. C., 9 Paige, 440), that measure not being applicable where there is a separate committee of the person ; but will be regarded as an actual and necessary expense, which would have to be paid out of the estate to some one, and is to be paid in this instance to the gentleman who is the committee of the person, for the reason that he can communicate with the lunatic in the only tongue in which he can or will speak, and is from that and many other reasons, a most appropriate one to whom to confide the execution of this most delicate and very responsible trust, which it would be unreasonable to expect him to discharge for the benefit of this friendless stranger, unless he is remunerated for his time and trouble. It will involve in the meanwhile, the abandonment of his business here, and is to be regarded like the cases of Annesley (Ambl., 78), of Evington (Jacob, 406, 2 Russ. 567), and of Ord (Jacob, 94), as an exceptional one to the general rule, that no compensation will be allowed to the committee of a lunatic for Ms personal services (Anon., 10 Ves., 103; Shelf, on Lunacy, 163).\nThe final order may be settled upon one day\u2019s notice."},{"case_name":"Pennsylvania College Cases","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1134216\/","date":"1871-12-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Mr. Justice CLIFFORD\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\nJefferson College was incorporated on the fifteenth of January, 1802, by the name of the Trustees of Jefferson College in Canonsburg in the county of Washington, for the education of youth in the learned languages and the arts, sciences, and useful literature. By the charter, it was declared that the trustees should be a body politic and corporate, with perpetual succession, in deed and in law, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, and that the constitution of the college \u201cshall not be altered or alterable by any ordinance or law of the said trustees, nor in any other manner than by an act of the legislature of the Commonwealth.\u201d\nWashington College was incorporated on the twenty- eighth of March, 1806, by the name of The Trustees of Washington College for the education of youth in the learned and foreign languages, the useful arts, sciences, and literature, and was located in the town of Washington, seven miles distant from Jefferson College, in the same county.\nExperience showed in the progress of events that the interests of both institutions would be promoted in their union, and the friends of both united in a common effort to effect that object. Application was accordingly made to the legislature for that purpose, and on the fourth of March, 1865, the legislature passed the \u201cAct to unite the colleges of Jeffersou and Washington, in the county of Washington, and to erect the same into one corporation under the name of Washington and Jefferson College.\u201d Enough is stated in the preamble of the act to show that the application was made to promote the best interests of both institutions, and that the legislative act which is the subject of complaint was passed at their united request and to sanction the union which their respective trustees had previously agreed to establish. Inconveniences resulted from the provisions contained in the thirteenth section of the act, which impliedly forbid an}' change in the sites of the respective colleges, and also provided that the studies of certain classes of the students should be pursued at each of the two institutions, and to that end prescribed certain rules for appropriating to each certain portions of the income derived from the funds of the institution, and the manner in which the same should be expended and applied by the trustees. Such embarrassments increasing, the legislature passed a supplementary act, providing that the several departments of the two colleges should be closely united, and that the united institution should be located as therein prescribed. Measures were also prescribed in the same act for determining the location of the united institution, and it appears that those measures, when carried into effect, resulted in fixing the location at Washington, in the county of the same name. Certain parties are dissatisfied with the new arrangement, and it appears that, on the twenty-fourth of August, 1869, three bills in equity were filed, in the State court, praying that the last-named act of the legislature may be declared null and void as repugnant to the ninth article of the constitution of the State, and to the tenth section of the first article of the Federal Constitution. Different parties complain in each of the several cases, but the subject-matter of the complaint involves substantially the same considerations in all the cases. Those complaining in the first case are the trustees of Jefferson College. Complainants in the second case are certain members of the board of trustees of Washington and Jefferson College, who oppose the provisions of the act of the twenty-sixth of February, 1869, and deny that the board of trustees, even by a vote of two-thirds of the members, as therein required, can properly remove the college or dispose of the college buildings as therein contemplated. Objections are made by the complainants iu the last case to both the before-mentioned acts of the legislature, and they claim the right to ask the interposition of the court, upon the ground that they are owners of certain scholarships in Jefferson College, as more fully set forth in the bill of complainant, and they pray that both of the said acts of Assembly may be declared null and void for the same reasons as those set forth in the other two cases.\nI. Examination of these cases will be made in the order they appear on the calendar, commencing with the case in which the trustees of Jefferson College are the complainants. They bring their bill of complaint against the two colleges as united, under the first act of Assembly passed for that purpose. Service was made and the respondents appeared and pleaded in bar that the complainants, as such trustees, duly accepted the act of Assembly creating the union of the two institutions, and that having accepted the same they, as a corporation, became dissolved and ceased to exist, and have no authority to maintain their bill of complaint. Apart from the plea in bar they also filed an answer, but as the whole issue is presented in the plea in bar it will not be necessary to enter into those details. Opposed to that plea is the replication of the complainants, in which they deny the allegation that they, as a corporation, became dissolved or that they ceased to exist as alleged in the plea in bar, and renew their prayer for relief. Both parties were heard, and the Supreme Court of the State entered a decree for the respondents, dismissing the bill of complaint. Decrees for the respondents were also entered in the other two cases, and the respective complainants sued out writs of error under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, and removed the respective causes into this court for re-examination.\n\"Whether the act of Assembly in question in this case is or not repugnant to the constitution of the State is conclusively settled against the complainants by the decision in this very case, and the question is not one open to re-examination in this court, as it is not one of Federal cognizance in a case brought here by a writ of error to a State court. Nothing, therefore, remains to be examined but the second question presented in the pleadings, which is, whether the supplementary act of Assembly uniting the two institutions and providing that there should be but one location of the same for any purpose, impairs the obligation of the contract between the State and the corporation of Jefferson College, as created by the original charter; or, in other words, whether it is repugnant to the tenth section of the first article of the Federal Constitution.\nCorporate franchises granted to private corporations, if duly accepted by the corporators, partake of the nature of legal estates, as the grant under such circumstances becomes a coutract within the protection of that clause of the Constitution which ordains that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Charters of private corporations are regarded as executed contracts between the government and the corporators, and the rule is well settled that the legislature cannot repeal, impair, or alter such a charter against the consent or without the default of the corporation judicially ascertained and declared. Of course these remarks apply only to acts of incorporation which do not contain any reservations or provisions annexing conditions to the charter modifying and limiting the nature of the contract. Cases often arise where the legislature, in granting an act of incorporation for a private purpose, either make the duration of the charter conditional or reserve to the State the power to alter, modify, or repeal the same at pleasure. Where such a provision is incorporated in the charter it is clear that it qualifies the grant, and that the subsequent exercise of that reserved power cannot be regarded as an act within the prohibition of the Constitution. Such a power also, that is the power to alter, modify, or repeal an act of incorporation, is frequently reserved to the State by a general law applicable to all acts of incorporation, or to certain classes of the same, as the ease may be, in which case it is equally clear that the power may be exercised whenever it appears that the act of incorporation is one which falls -within the reservation and that the charter was granted subsequent to the passage of the general law, even though the charter contains no such condition nor any allusion to such a reservation. Reservations in such a charter, it is admitted, may be made, and it is also conceded that where they exist the exercise of the power reserved by a subsequent legislature does not impair the obligation of the contract created by the original act of incorporation. Subsequent legislation altering or modifying the provisions of such a charter, wdiere there is no such reservation, is certainly unauthorized if it is prejudicial to the rights of the corporators, and was passed w-ithout their assent, but the converse of the proposition is also true, that if the new provisions altering and modifying the charter were passed with the assent of the corporation and they were duly accepted by a corporate vote as amendments to the original charter they cannot be regarded as impairing the obligation of the contract created by the original charter. Private charters or such as are granted for the private benefit of the corporators are held to be contracts because they are based for their consideration on the liabilities and duties which the corporators assume- by accepting the terms therein specified, and the grant of the franchise on that account can no more be resumed by the legislature or its benefits diminished or impaired without the assent of the corporators than any other grant of property or legal estate, unless the right to do so is reserved in the act of incorporation or in some general law of the State which was in operation at the time the charter was granted.\nApply those principles to the case under consideration and it is quite clear that the decision of the State court was correct, as the fifth section of the charter, by necessary implication, reserves to the State the power to alter, modify, or amend the charter without any prescribed limitation. Provision is there made that the constitution of the college shall not be altered or alterable by any ordinance or law of the trustees, \u201c nor in any other manner than by an act of the legislature of the Commonwealth,\u201d which is in all respects equivalent to an express reservation to the State to make any alterations in the charter which the legislature in its wisdom may deem fit, just,, and expedient to enact, and the donors of the institution are as much bound by that provision as the trustees.\nSuppose, however, the fact were otherwise, still the re spondents must prevail, as it is admitted that the complain* ants accepted the act passed to unite the two colleges and to erect the same into one corporation, which supports to every intent the respondents\u2019 plea in ba,r and utterly disproves the allegations of the complainants\u2019 replication denying that the complainant corporation was dissolved before their bill of complaint was filed. Doubts have often been expressed whether a private corporation can be dissolved by the surrender of its corporate franchise into the hands of the government, but the question presented in this case is not of that character, as the act of the legislature uniting the two colleges did not contemplate that either college as an institution of learning should cease to exist, or that the funds of either should be devoted to any other use than that described in the original charters. All that was contemplated by the act in question was that the two institutions should be united in one corporation, as requested by the friends and patrous of both, that they might secure greater patronage and be able to extend their usefulness and carry out more, effectually the great end and aim of their creation. Authorized as the act of the legislature was by the reservation contained in the original charter, and sanctioned as the act was by having been adopted by the corporators, it is clear to a demonstration that the act uniting the two colleges was a valid act, and that the two original corporations became merged in the one corporation created by the amendatory and enabling act passed for that purpose, and that neither of the original corporations is competent to sue for any cause of action subsequent in date to their acceptance of the new act of incorporation.\nII. Sufficient has already been remarked to show that the case of the dissenting trustees of the new corporation, which is the second case, is governed by the same principles as the preceding ease. They admit that the act of the legislature uniting the two colleges iu one corporation was duly accepted by the origiual corporators, aud they also admit in effect that it is a valid law. Express provision was therein made that the two colleges should be united in one corporation by the name of Washington and Jefferson College, aud that the new corporation should possess aud enjoy all the capacities, powers, privileges, immunities, aud franchises which were possessed and enjoyed by the original institutions and the trustees thereof, \u201c with such enlargements and subject to such changes therein U3 are made by this act.\u201d Accepted as that act was by the trustees of the original institutions, they not only ratified the reservation contained in the fifth section of the charter of Jefferson College, but they in express terms adopted the changes made iu the amended charter uniting the two institutions iu one corporation.\nViewed in the light of these suggestions the present case stands just as it would if the reservation contained in the original charter had been in terms incorporated into the new charter uniting the two institutions into one corporation, which the complainants in this case admit is a valid act of the legislature. Such an admission, however, is not necessary to establish that fact, as the act was passed by the assent of the two corporations aud in pursuance of the reserved power to that effect contained iu the original charter of the corporation to which the complaining corporators in the preceding case belonged. Grant that the power existed in the legislature to pass the act uniting the two institutions aud it follows that the supplementary act which was passed to render the first act practically available is also a rightful exercise of legislative authority, as it is clear that substantially the same reservation is contained iu the act providing for the union of the two institutions as that contained in the original charter by virtue of which the act was passed uniting the two institutions in one corporation. Tested by these considerations the court here is of the opinion that the decision of the State court in the second case is also correct.\nIII. Plans of various kinds were devised by the trustees of Jefferson College and put in operation for the endowment of the institution; and, among others, was the plan of establishing what was called the scholarships, whereby a contributor on payment of twenty-five dollars became entitled to tuition for one person for a prescribed period, called a right to a single scholarship; or, on payment of fifty dollars, to a family scholarship; or, on payment of one hundred dollars, to tuition for thirty years; or, on payment of four hundred dollars, to a perpetual scholarship, to be designated by whatever name the contributor might select. Contracts of the kind were outstanding at the respective times when each of the two acts of the legislature in question was passed, and the complainants in the third case are owners of such scholarships, and they bring their bill of complaint, for themselves and such other persons owning such scholarships as may desire to unite in the bill for the relief therein prayed. They pray that both of the before-mentioned acts of the legislature may be declared null and void as repugnant both to the State and Federal Constitution, but it will be sufficient to remark, without entering into any further explanations, that the second question is the only one which can bo re-examined in this court. \"What they claim is that the acts of the legislature in question impair the obligation of their contracts for scholarship as made with the trustees of Jefferson College before the two institutions were united in one corporation. Deference must be made to the charter creating the union as well as to the original charters in order to ascertain whether there is any foundation for the allegations of the bill of complaint.\nBy the first section of the act creating the union it is provided that the new corporation \u201c shall possess and enjoy all the capacities, powers, privileges, immunities, and franchises which were conferred upon and held by said colleges of Jefferson and Washington and the trustees thereof\u2019 with such enlargements and subject to such changes therein as are made by this act.\u201d Section two also provides that all the real and personal property held and possessed by or in trust for the said colleges, with all endowment funds, choses in action, stocks, bequests, and devises, and all other rights whatever to them belonging, are thereby transferred to and vested in the new corporation; and the further provision is that \u201call the several liabilities of said two colleges or corporations, by either of them suffered or created, including the scholarships heretofore granted by and obligatory upon each of them, are hereby imposed upon and declared to be assumed by the corporation hereby created, which shall discharge and perform the. same without diminution or abatement.\u201d\nUndoubtedly the corporate franchises of the two institutions were contracts of the description protected by that clause of the Constitution which ordains that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, but the contract involved in such an act of incorporation is a contract between the State and the corporation, and as such the terms of the contract may, as a general rule, be altered, modified, or amended by the assent of the corporation, even though the charter contains no such reservation and there was none such existing in any general law of the State at the time the charter was granted. Persons making contracts with a private corporation know that the legislature, even without the assent of the corporation, may amend, alter, or modify their charters in all cases where the power to do so is reserved in the charter or in any antecedent general law in operation at the time the charter was granted, and they also know that such amendments, alterations, and modifications may, as a general rule, be made by the legislature with the assent of the corporation, even in cases where the charter is unconditional in its terms and there is no general law of the State containing any such reservation. Such contracts made between individuals and the corporation do not vary or in any manner change or modify the relation between the State and the corporation in respect to the right of the State to alter, modify, or amend such a charter, as the power to pass such laws depends upon the assent of the corporation or upon some reservation made at the time, as evidenced by some pre-existing general law or by an express provision incorporated into the charter. Cases arise undoubtedly where a court of equity will enjoin a corporation not to proceed under an amendment to their charter passed by their assent, as where the effect would be to enable the corporation to violate their contracts with third persons, but no such question is here presented for the decision of this court, nor can it ever be under a writ of error to a State court. Questions of that kind are addressed very largely to the judicial discretion of the court and create the necessity for inquiry into the facts of the case and for an examination into all the surrounding circumstances. Beyond doubt such a question may be presented in the Circuit Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction, concurrent with the State courts, but it is clear that such a question can never be brought here for re-examination by a writ of error to a State court, as such a writ only removes into this court the questions, or some one of the questions, described in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Aet. Considerations of that kind must, therefore, be dismissed, as the only question presented for decision is whether the acts of the legislature mentioned in the bill of complaint impair the obligation of the contracts for scholarship made by the complainants with the trustees of Jefferson College'.\nDecided cases are referred to in which it is held that the trustees\"of such an institution, where the terms of the charter amount to a contract and the charter contains no reservation of a right to alter, modify, or amend it, cannot consent to any change in the charter made by the legislature, which contemplates a diversion of the funds of the institution to any other purpose than that described and declared in the original charter. All, or nearly all of such decisions are based on a state of facts where an attempt was made to take the control of such an institution from one religious sect or denomination and to give the control of it to another and a different sect or denomination, in violation of the intent and purpose of the original donors of the institution. Questions of that kind, however, are uot involved in the present record, nor do the court intend to express any opinion in respect to such a controversy. Charters of the kind may certainly be altered, modified, or amended in all cases where the power to pass such laws is reserved in the charter or in some antecedent general law, nor can it be doubted that the assent of the corporation is sufficient to render such legislation valid, unless it appears that the new legislation will have the effect to change the control of the institution, or to divert the fund of the donors to some new use inconsistent with the intent, and purpose for which the endowment was originally made. Consent of the corporation, it is conceded, is sufficient to warrant alteration, modification, and amendments iu the charters of moneyed, business, and commercial corporations, and it is not perceived that the question presented in this record stands upon any different footing from such as arise out of legislation of that character, as the principal objection to the legislation in question is that the removal of Jefferson College to the newly selected location exposes the complainants, as owners of the scholarships, to increased expense and to additional inconvenience. They do not pretend that the effect of the new legislation will be to lessen the influence and usefulness of the college, or to divert the funds to a different purpose from that which was intended by the donors, nor that it will have the effect to change the character of the institution from the original purpose and design of its founders. Pretences of the kind, if set up, could not be supported, as the whole record shows that the two acts of Assembly were passed at the earnest solicitation of the patrons of the two institutions as well as at the request of the respective boards of trustees.\nEven suppose that the consent of the corporation is no answer to the objections of the complainants, still the decree of the State court must be affirmed, as it is clear that the reservation in the charter fully warranted the legislature in passing both the acts which are the subject of complaint. Suggestion may be made that the reservation even in the original charter is not expressed in direct terms, but the terms are the same as those employed in the charter which was the subject of judicial examination in the case of Commonwealth v. Bonsall et al., which was decided more than thirty years ago by the Supreme Court of the State. Provision was made in the charter in that case that the constitution of a certain public school should not be altered or alterable by any law of the trustees, or in any other manner than by an act of the legislature of this State. When incorporated the charter of the school provided that the trustees should be chosen by such persons as had contributed or should contribute to the amount of forty shillings for the purposes of the corporation. Pursuant to the petition of the trustees the legislature passed an act which repealed that clause of the charter, and provided that all the citizens residing within the limits of the township should be entitled to vote at all such elections, and the Supreme Court of the State held unanimously that the act of Assembly was a valid act, even though it was not accepted by the corporation. Reference is made to that case to show that the clause in the charter of Jefferson College, called the reservation, furnished complete authority to alter, modify, or amend the charter, and certainly it must be conceded that that case is a decisive authority to that point.\nControlled by these reasons the court is of the opinion that the act uniting the two colleges in one corporation was a valid act even as against the complainants in the third case.\nThey complain also of the supplementary act, but they hardly contend that the legislature, in passing the act to unite the two institutions, parted with any power which was reserved in the original charter of Jefferson College to enact any proper law to alter, modify, or amend the act providing for that union. Extended argument upon that topic does not seem to be necessary, as there is not a word in the act which favors such a construction or which gives such a theory the slightest support. Proper care was taken by the legislature to protect the rights of these complainants by incorporating into the act uniting the two colleges a provision that the new corporation should discharge and perform those liabilities without diminution or abatement. Such contracts were made with the trustees and not with the State, and it is a mistake to suppose that the existence of such a contract between the corporation and an individual would inhibit the legislature from altering, modifying, or amending the charter of the corporation by virtue of a right reserved to that effect, or with the assent of the corporation, if, in view of all the circumstances, the legislature should see fit to exercise that power.\nDecree in each case affirmed.\n*\nDartmouth College v.

J.\nThe money which the plaintiffs claim to recover in this action was realized under and by virtue of an act of the legislature of this State, entitled \u201cAn act to make further provision for the government of the county of New York,\u201d passed on April 26, 1870 (1 Laws of 1870, ch. 382, p. 875).\nBy section 4 of said act it was provided, that \u201cAll liabilities against the county of New York, previous to the passage of this act, shall be audited by the mayor of the city of New York, the comptroller of the said city, and the then present president of the board of supervisors, and the amounts which are found to be due shall be provided for by the issue of revenue bonds of the county of New York, payable during the year 1871; and the board of supervisors shall include in the ordinance levying the taxes for the year 1871 an amount sufficient to pay said bonds and the interest thereon, such claims shall be paid by the comptroller to the party or parties entitled to receive the same, upon the certificate of the officers named herein.\u201d\nIt will be observed that the money raised by the issue of revenue bonds was to be paid by the comptroller to the parties entitled to receive the same upon the certificate of the officers designated.\nAlthough the complaint alleges that the money obtained upon the bonds issued was deposited to the credit of an account kept by the chamberlain of the city of New York, as county treasurer of said county, there is no statute authorizing or requiring any such deposit, and therefore this allegation is immaterial to make out a cause of action, and this case must be considered as if the money remained in the possession and under the control of the officer named, for the purposes designated in the act, until otherwise lawfully disposed of.\nThe money claimed was in the hands of the comptroller, to be paid by him, as required by law, to the parties who had a lawful right to the same, and the bonds upon which the money was obtained were subsequently taken up in pursuance of chapter 323, entitled \u201cAn Act for the consolidation of the debt of the county of New York\u201d (1 Laws of 1871, p. 631), and new bonds issued in the place of the old ones.\nThe injury complained of, and for which redress is sought in this action, is for issuing bonds for a larger amount than was required for the purposes named,\u2014 viz: the payment of liabilities against the county,\u2014 and the appropriation of the excess of money which was thus raised, by and for the benefit of the defendants.\nThere was no lawful authority to raise any amount of money beyond what was required for objects con templated by the act of 1870, before cited. The amount which was realized, besides what was required for the payment of debts, was not for the benefit of the county or to pay its liabilities, or to be paid into the county treasury for any purpose whatever.\nThere is no law either for raising or appropriating any such fund, beyond the liabilities of the county, for if six millions, or any less sum, could be raised in this manner, then one hundred millions, or any other unlimited amount, might be thus obtained.\nSo far, then, as the money appropriated by the defendants is concerned, it was procured without any lawful authority, and in fact, in direct violation of law, as the act under which it was supposed to be obtained does not sanction any such proceeding. It was only legal debts, honest and bona fide liabilities against the county, which were to be audited and provided for by the issue of revenue bonds, and none but these demands would properly come within the provisions of the law.\nThe defendants then were in possession of funds' without any legal sanction whatever. As they were not obtained for the benefit of the county, nor lawfully paid to its proper officer, I am inclined to think that the county was not the owner, and never had lawful control over the money, and it never was within its lawful custody. While the county is liable to the innocent and bona fide holders of the bonds issued by its proper officers in due form, acting under color of authority, it by no means follows that the funds thus unlawfully obtained and which never had been lawfully paid over to the county or for its benefit, were the property of the county.\nEven if it be conceded that the county in its corporate capacity can sue, as it was neither the owner nor in the lawful possession of this money, it could not maintain an action of the character of the one now before us, for its recovery.\nThe tax-payers can maintain no such action, nor in any form demand redress, as has been adjudicated by the courts in numerous cases (Doolittle v. Supervisors of Broome Co., 18 N. Y., 155; Roosevelt v. Draper, 16 How. Pr., 137; 23 N. Y., 324. See, also, 12 Pet., 100). The future tax-payers who may be called upon to pay the bonds, who are at present unknown, and some of them not in existence, are the parties really interested ; and they cannot prosecute, for the reason that it is not known who they are or may be. Unless this action can be maintained, there is perhaps no remedy.\nAssuming then, as I think we must, from the pleadings, that the money was unlawfully raised, and that it was unlawfully received and held by the defendant, the question arises, and is the main question to be decided in this case, whether the people can maintain this action ?\nIt is contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the power of the attorney-general in England, as the representative of the crown, to correct abuses or misapplication of trust funds, by an information in equity, was confined to trusts for charitable uses; and that funds of municipal corporations which are not held for charitable purposes are not considered as trust funds, but are regarded as the property of the corporations, the same as estates of private individuals belong to them personally, and in such case, the only remedy, prior to the English act of 1835, for any misappropriation or embezzlement, was by an action or proceeding in the name of the corporation.\nAssuming that the money in controversy was the property of the corporation of the city and county of New York, which, as already stated, is at least exceedingly questionable, it is a matter of serious inquiry how far the English authorities sustain the doctrine contended for.\nIn the Attorney-General v. Brown (3 Swanst. Ch., 265), which was decided in 1818, an information in equity was filed by the attorney-general against commissioners appointed by an act of Parliament, being authorized to levy a rate not exceeding a certain amount, on the occupiers of all houses, &c., in Brighton, for paving, lighting, and watching the town, and another rate on coal landed upon the beach or otherwise brought into the town, for repairing or building works to protect the coast of Brighton against the encroachment of the sea, with power of distress for non-payment, &c.\nIt was alleged that the commissioners had improperly applied a large portion of the rate collected, and had distrained the goods of the relator for non-payment of the duty, and the information asked for an account and an injunction against an undue levy, and a direction that they replace any sums which they had applied to purposes not warranted by the act. A general demurrer for want of equity, and a defect of parties, was overruled.\nThe Lord Chancellor Eldon, at the close of the argument, remarked: \u201cIt is said that this is not a charitable use, and I am not disposed at present to consider it such;\" and in an able and elaborate opinion, after a full discussion of the case, said, among other things, \"I have heard nothing which prevents my concurring in the opinion that a parliamentary grant, destined to such purposes, is a gift to charitable uses. If that doctrine is contradicted, it must be done by higher authority than mine.\u201d\nAlthough it is claimed that this case was decided on the ground alone, that there was a charitable use, that such was not the fact appears quite distinctly from the case of Attorney-General v. Mayor, &c. of Dublin (1 Bligh N. P. 312), which is hereinafter particularly referred to.\nThe next case in the order of time bearing upon the question, is the Attorney-General v. Willis (2 Simons & S., 67).\nThis case was decided in 1824, by the then Vice-Chancellor Sir John Leach, who had been counsel in the case of Attorney-General v. Brown. It was an information and bill in which ten persons were the relators and plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all the other tenants and occupiers of houses and other premises situate in Great Bolton, in the county of Lancaster, subject to the rates of assessments, and entitled to the benefit of certain acts of parliament, under which a common was enclosed and vested in commissioners, upon trust, to apply the rents for the improvement of the town, with power to them to levy a rate on the inhabitants in case the rents were insufficient. An account was asked of the rents, alleging misapplication, and that a rate levied was unnecessary. A general demurrer was interposed for want of equity, which was overruled, on the ground, among others, that funds supplied from the gift of the crown or of the legislature, or of private persons, for any legal, ;public or general purpose, are charitable funds, to be administered by courts of equity. The case of the Attorney-General v. Brown is referred to in the opinion of the Vice-Chancellor Sir John Leach, who had been counsel against the information in that case, and the views expressed appear to have been based somewhat upon an erroneous construction given by him to the authority in Attorney-General v. Brown, which case, as will be seen, sustains a different doctrine.\nIn Attorney-General v. Mayor, &c. of Dublin (1 Bligh N. P., 312), decided in 1827, an information and bill was filed in behalf of the inhabitants of Dublin paying water-rates, against the corporation, stating various acts of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds arising from the rates, submitting that the corporation were trustees under the act for the rates thereby given, for uses which were charitable in their nature, and charging that the conduct of the corporation amounted to a breach of trust, and praying (among other things) for a declaration and execution of the trust, and that accounts might be taken of the rates received by the corporation and the application thereof, that the wrong-doers be decreed to replace the moneys they had wrongfully taken or misapplied, &c.\nIt was submitted in the answer, that the purposes specified in the act were not charitable uses, and held (reversing the judgment of the court below) that the court had jurisdiction to entertain the information and bill.\nThe decision of this case is not put upon the ground that it came within the statute in regard to charitable uses.\nLord Redesdale, who wrote the principal opinion, at page 341, says : \u201c It is expedient in such cases that there should be a remedy, and highly important that persons in the receipt of public money should know that they are liable to account, in a court of equity, as well upon the misapplication of, as for withholding the funds.\u201d \u201c Suppose even the case of a public accountant, clearly within the act, who having embezzled or misemployed the public moneys, had rendered accounts which were imperfect or fabricated, could not the attorney-general, upon discovery of the fact, or the fraud, proceed by information to recover the moneys so fraudulently withheld or misappropriated?\u201d\nAgain, he says: \u201cA similar remedy is applicable, as I conceive, to any person having the trust and management of public money; any public accountant, of any description.\u201d\nAt page 347, he farther remarks : \u201cWe are referred to the statute of Elizabeth, with respect to charitable uses, as creating a new law upon the subject of charitable uses. The statute created only a new jurisdiction\u2014it created no new law,\u201d &c.......\u201cIn the process of time, indeed, it was found that the commission of charitable uses was not the best remedy, and that it was better to resort again to the proceedings, by way of information, in the name of the attorney-general. The right which the attorney-general has to file an information is a right of prerogative; the king, as parens patri\u00e6, has a right, by his proper officer, to call upon the several courts of justice, according to their several jurisdictions, to see that right is done to his subjects, who are incompetent to take care of themselves, as in case of charities and other cases.\u201d\nThe Lord Chancellor (Eldon), in the course of the argument, at page 334, observed that, \u201cThe case of Attorney-General v. Brown, whether ill or well decided, was not decided solely upon the ground that it was a charitable use. Upon reflection I thought so, but the judgment rested upon other grounds.\u201d Again, he remarks: \u201cIn Attorney-General v. Brown the question was much argued whether the fund was to be applied to a charitable use. After the argument, it appeared to me that it was a charitable use. But that was not the ground of the judgment in that case, whether it was well or ill founded; because I was of opinion that the court of chancery had jurisdiction in that case, whether it was or was not a charitable use\u201d He also remarks, at page 35, that the case of Attorney-General v. Heelis, weakens the authority of Attorney-General v. Brown, because much of the doctrine in the former case is not reconcilable with the principle of the decision in Attorney-General v. Brown. That in neither of those cases did the court look sufficiently into the old law upon the subject, and that the research which has been made, rather confirms the decision in Attorney-General v. Brown. At page 357, he further states that, in Attorney-General v. Brown he \u201cwas of the opinion that it,was not necessary that it should be a charitable use, to give the court of chancery jurisdiction upon the subject.\u201d\nThe case of Attorney-General v. Mayor, &c., of Dublin, is a strong and decided authority for the doctrine that jurisdiction exists, in all cases of public trust of the character indicated, in favor of the crown.\nI think that the cases already referred to, as explained in 1 Bligh, must be regarded, up to that time, as holding that a charitable use is not essential to maintain the action to reach moneys misappropriated under the circumstances stated.\nIn 1835, the case of Attorney-General v. Mayor, &c., of Dublin, was followed and sustained by Attorney-General v. Mayor, &c., of Liverpool (1 Milne & C., 171), where it was held that the court had authority, under its general jurisdiction, to interfere for the protection of property vested in the corporation of a borough, upon the ground of a breach of trust committed or threatened.\nThe case from 1 Bligh is cited, and at page 201, the master of the rolls remarks, \u201c Nobody ever questioned the right of a court of equity to interpose, in order to see that the public duties were discharged, and that, the trusts upon which the corporation held the property were duly performed.\u201d\nThe injunction issued was dissolved, because the construction of the statute was doubtful, and the injunction would deprive parties of the opportunity to exercise a right.\nThe information filed in the last case cited, was amended, and the same case is reported in 1 Keene, 513, under the title of Attorney-General v. Aspinwall, where the demurrer was again allowed by the master of the rolls.\nUpon an appeal to the high court of chancery, the decree of the master of the rolls was reversed (2 Mylne & C., 613).\nIt should be stated that the information in this case was filed for the purpose of setting aside a mortgage and an appropriation of moneys raised by the corporation of Liverpool, to endow certain clergymen officiating in that city, made by the old corporation before the election of officers under the new organization, and it was held that where property is devoted to trusts which are to arise at a future day, and to be exercised by trustees not yet in esse, an intermediate act done by the holders of such property, inconsistent with the security of the property or the performance of the trusts when they shall arise, will be set aside; and if the trusts are of a public nature, the court will entertain this jurisdiction upon an information of the attorney-general, notwithstanding that the trustees, after they come into esse themselves, decline to interfere. The lord chancellor said, page 623: \u201c I cannot doubt that a clear trust was created by this act for public, and therefore, in the legal sense of the term, charitable purposes, of all the property belonging to the corporation at the time of the passage of the act.\u201d\nThe doctrine laid down in the case last cited, is in accordance with the decisions in the previous cases to which reference has been made, as explained in 1 Bligh. It may be remarked that the last case was subsequent to the English Reform Act of 1835 (5 and 6 W. IV., ch. 79), by which corporate funds were declared to be trust estates and funds of a public character, and the corporations or local officers becoming trustees for the benefit of the public, who became beneficiaries under the provisions of the act, and involved the construction of some portions of that act. This fact does not, however, alter the law, as settled by previous cases, as to the right to maintain the action, even if there is not a trust in the nature of a charitable use, and does not impair the full and direct approval of the Lord Chancellor Eldon of the doctrine which had previously been enunciated. Since the passage of the act of 1835, the right of the attorney-general to bring actions of a similar character has been repeatedly adjudicated in the English courts (see Attorney-General ex rel. Mayor, &c. v. Wilson, 1 Craig & Phil., 1; Attorney-General v. Corporation of Poole, 2 Keene, 190; S. C., 4 Mylne & C., 17; also 8 Clarke & F., 409; Attorney-General v. Eastlake, 11 Hare, 205; The Same v. Bennett, 3 Irish Eq., 392; The Same v. Compton, 1 Youngs & C., 417). I do not consider it important to review these cases at length, and will only refer to one of them, which directly bears upon the question discussed.\nAttorney-General v. Eastlake (supra), was an information filed at the relation of two of the rate-payers of Plymouth, against a majority of certain commissioners appointed under a local act, who were authorized to levy rates for paving, lighting, &c., the streets of a town, and it was held that as the object was beneficial, not only to the inhabitants subjected to the rates, but also to other persons having occasion to visit the town, the purpose was public and charitable within the meaning of the statute of charitable uses, and the question depends not on the source from which the funds were derived, but the purposes for which they were applied. In this case the earlier authorities are examined and discussed at length by the learned vicechancellor, who considered that the case of Heelis was overruled, and that of Brown sustained by 1 Bligh. He argues, at page 216, that \u201call the cases agree that not only the particular public or general purposes expressed in the statute of Elizabeth are charitable, but that all other legal, public or general purposes are within the equity of the statute.\u201d\nAfter stating a case where an act of Parliament is passed for a private purpose, and for the benefit of individuals who are dealing with their own property, he remarks, at pages 222, &c.: \u201cBut when you come to the purpose of paving and lighting a town, which is for the benefit of all the inhabitants,\u201d &c......\u201c one does not need to look at this recital, by which we are told that amongst other things, there will be benefited The Royal Naval Hospital, The Royal Barracks, and other public establishments. It is sufficient to say, it is a large and general purpose for this town, although not beyond the limits of the town, and for that purpose certain moneys are to be levied. I cannot see that the source from which these moneys are here derived, namely from taxation, can make any difference as to the charitable or public nature, and which would be attributable to the funds, if they proceeded from a more limited sphere of bounty; and if there be no distinction on that ground, the attorney-general is the proper person to represent those who are interested in that general and public or charitable purpose.\u201d This case, then, virtually and really holds that all public uses are in legal effect charitable uses, and that funds raised for the general purposes of the public are within the rule. If rates raised for the paving of a town are within the rule, moneys realized under an act of the legislature, to pay debts incurred in the government of a great city, and in making public improvements for the benefit of its inhabitants and others who may have business there, are clearly embraced in the principle decided. The analogy is striking between the two cases, and I am unable to discover any real ground of distinction.\nThe case of Attorney-General v. Corporation of Caermarthen (Cooper Eq., 36), cited by defendant\u2019s counsel, is not in opposition to these views. In that case a demurrer was interposed for multifariousness, which was allowed, and the case was decided in 1805, long prior to the decisions before cited, which uphold the doctrine that an action may be maintained by the attorney-general, even if there is not a charitable use.\nA careful review of the English cases establishes beyond controversy, that whenever an individual or a corporation have been authorized by a statute to administer public funds for public purposes such person or body is liable to an action by the attorney-general for any misappropriation or misconduct in the performance of the trust. I am not aware of any reason why the same principle should not control in this case.\nThe defendants\u2019 counsel rely upon the case of People v. Miner (2 Lans., 396), as an authority in their behalf, which it is claimed, being a general term decision of this court, is decisive of the question. The action in that case was brought in the name of The People against the defendants, as said road commissioners, to restrain them from issuing certain bonds under an act of the legislature of this State for railroad purposes, and it was held that neither the Code confers upon the attorney-general the power to prosecute in the name of the people, nor has he such power at common law. The learned judge who wrote the opinion maintains the position, that the only cases in which, at common law, the attorney-general was authorized to interfere to restrain corporate action, or was a necessary party for that purpose, were those in which the act complained of would produce a public nuisance or tend to a breach of trust for charitable uses.\nIn this, I think he is entirely mistaken, so far at least as relates to municipal corporations, and he does not sufficiently discriminate between public and private corporations, the difference between which should be borne in mind in the examination of a question of this character.\nIt is also apparent that he has entirely overlooked the case of Attorney-General v. Mayor of Dublin (1 Bligh N. P., 312), to which he refers, at page 407, and says: \u201c I have thus referred to all the cases cited in the opinion of Duer, J., except that in 2 Bligh N. P., 312, which I have not been able to find.\u201d\nThe case is wrongly cited in 2 Duer, 668, as well as in 2 Lans., and hence was not at all considered by the learned judge. As this case thus omitted gives a construction to the prior decisions, and, as already shown, settles the law up to that period, its omission destroys the force of People v. Miner as a binding authority, even if it were applicable here. The fact that no effect is given to Attorney- General v. Mayor of Dublin, and the latter case not having been examined, discussed or considered, the last case cited is decisive of the quest'on now.\nIt may also be remarked that the opinion begins with a decision that the merits of the action were against the plaintiff, thus rendering it unnecessary to decide the question which was fully discussed, and therefore is obiter.\nThis case also holds substantially that a tax-payer is the proper party to bring such an action, which, if not erroneous, is at least doubtful, as the general term in the fourth department have recently held the other way. (See MS. opinion, Ayers v. Lawrence).\nWith all the respect which I entertain for the distinguished jurist who wrote the opinion referred to, and\" with all the consideration which should generally be given to a general term decision, it would not be in accordance with well established rules, to hold that this case under the circumstances was controlling and decisive.\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Utica Ins. Co. (2 Johns. Ch., 371), also cited by defendants, the right of the attorney-general to maintain an action against a private corporation was considered, but that authority does not, I think, decide the question here involved.\nIt merely related to the jurisdiction of the court over offenses against a public statute, in regard to the business of banking, which arose on a motion made by the attorney-general upon an information filed by him. The remarks at page 384 were not necessary to the decision of the case, and the authorities cited mainly looked the other way. But, conceding that the opinion expressed is entitled to consideration, it is worthy of observation that the principle claimed to be upheld has been overruled in the English courts by numerous subsequent cases. This case was decided in 1817, while those which we have already cited as decisive of the law were all determined at a far later period.\nThe defendants also rely upon the language of Davis, J., in People v. Booth (32 N. Y., 398). This is not an analogous case, and the remarks there made were not called for in deciding the case, and therefore must considered as an obiter dictum.\nIt has been held that the attorney-general may prosecute on behalf of the State, or the State itself, where a preventive remedy is called for by the circumstances (Davis v. Mayor of N. Y., 14 N. Y., 526; The same v. The same, 2 Duer, 663; see, also, 11 Hare, 223).\nIn 2 Duer, 666, 667 and 668 (supra), the right of the attorney-general in the name of the people to maintain an action for a public wrong is fully and ably vindicated, and although the authority of the last case is questioned in People v. Miner, I am inclined to think that the views expressed by Duer, J., can be upheld, as we have already seen, both upon principle and authority.\nIn People v. Mayor, &c. (32 Barb., 102), it was held by Hogeboom, J., at special term, that where there was a clear violation of law or a clear misuse or abuse of corporate powers, the people, as representing the general public, the body of citizens who are aggrieved, are the proper parties to.enforce the remedy.\nIn People v. Lowber (7 Abb. Pr., 158), Ingraham, J., intimates an opinion that, in such a case as was then before him, the attorney-general might maintain the action.\nIn People v. Mayor (9 Abb. Pr., 253), the same views are expressed by the same learned judge. In People v. Mayor (10 Abb. Pr., 144), T. R. Strong, J., holds the same doctrine.\nAlthough the views of these distinguished judges are not entirely decisive, yet they are entitled to great consideration.\nThere are also several cases which have come to my knowledge, which are not reported, which are directly adverse to People v. Miner, and which involved the precise question which there arose; that is, whether the people could maintain an action restraining railroad commissioners from issuing bonds.\nIn People ex rel. Leonard Proctor v. Swarthout, which, I understand, was a similar action, Justice Mason, as referee, held that the action could be maintained, and in his opinion he says: \u201c This action is properly brought by the attorney-general in the name of the people on the relation of Proctor. The right to prosecute and maintain this action is given by statute,\u201d &c. \u201c The attorney-general has the right to maintain this suit, independent of the statute, at common law,\u201d and cites Story Eq. Pl., \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 49; Mitford Eq. Pl., 21, 24, 32; Barb., 102; Barb. on Parties, 367, Ed. on Parties in Eq., 6 and 61; Calvert on Parties, 301-308.\nIn People ex rel. Thompson v. Benedict, railroad commissioners and others, which was an action to declare void certain bonds alleged to have been unlawfully executed by said railroad commissioners, a demurrer was interposed to the complaint and sustained at special term. Upon an appeal at general term in the third judicial district, before Justices Hogeboom, Peckham and Ingalls, in March, 1870, Hogeboom, J., delivering the opinion, it was decided that the action was properly brought in the name of the people, and the demurrer overruled. The learned judge said, \u201cI think under our statutes authorizing suits to be commenced by the attorney-general to restrain corporations from exercising unlawful powers, and individuals from exercising corporate rights and privileges not granted to them by any law of the'State, and under the well established powers of a court of equity, this suit is well brought in the name of the people.\u201d\nThis case involved the same question as People v. Miner, and is similar in its leading features. The action could not be maintained without a decision of this very point in favor of the plaintiff; and as it is not apparent that any consideration bearing upon the question was overlooked, I am at a loss to see how it can be disregarded as a binding authority. It is at least entitled to as much weight as People v. Miner.\nAfter a careful examination of the cases bearing upon the question considered, my conclusion is, that the action is properly brought by the attorney-general in the name of the people, and can be maintained in its present form.\nWhere a public right is infringed upon, the State, by the attorney-general, may bring an action for the benefit of the people at large, or of a portion of the public. Such a rule cannot be confined merely to public nuisances. Many wrongs may exist without a remedy, except through the intervention of the State, and it seems to me that there is nothing inconsistent, with the principles upon which our government is founded and administered, to allow the chosen officer of the people in their own name to prosecute an action of this character, having in view the protection of the interests of the public against those acting as trustees on the behalf of a municipal corporation. There is no provision of the Revised Statutes or the Code inconsistent with such course of procedure; and I apprehend no danger can arise from the abuse of such a power, as it is always the subject of legislative restriction and regulation. This is the extent to which it is necessary to go to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nNor is there, in my opinion, any substantial ground for claiming that the action cannot be maintained in equity, because a money judgment is demanded.\nThe Code has abolished the distinction between law and equity, and the equitable character of the claim is not less apparent, because the money was unlawfully raised and misappropriated.\nThat the recovery of money may be a part of the relief demanded in an equitable action, is also abundantly established by authority. This was a part of the relief demanded in Attorney-General v. Mayor of Dublin, and Lord Redesdale, in his opinion, as we have already seen, puts the question whether the attorney-general could not proceed by information \" to recover the moneys so fraudulently withheld or misappropriated.\u201d See, also, Attorney-General v. Compton (1 Young & Coll., 416, 426, 427).\nIf an accounting can be demanded in such a case, it seems quite clear that where no accounting is required, because the amount misappropriated is fixed and de termined. that a recovery of the money in the hands of the parties may be demanded. If money could not be demanded in an action in equity, in cases of public trust, the equitable remedy would fail in many cases.\nIf the views expressed are correct, then it is not necessary to consider the question whether the board of supervisors or the county, even if there was a right in either of these bodies to sue, have authority to bring an action on behalf of the county.\nIn Attorney-General v. Wilson (1 Craig & P., 1), before cited, where the wrong-doers were officers of the borough of Leeds, the lord chancellor expressed an opinion, that although the attorney-general might assert the right of the public in an information, \u201cif before the act passed, a corporation might, in a proper case, institute a suit, for the purpose of setting aside transactions fraudulent against it, though carried into . effect in the name of the corporation, that right cannot be affected by the attorney -general having also a power to complain of the transaction.\u201d According to this intimation, there may, perhaps, be two rights of action which are not inconsistent.\nIt is not, however, necessary to determine this point, and is of no consequence, whether the county has the power to sue, if that right exists in the people.\nIt is quite enough that the action can be maintained, in its present form, in the name of the people, to uphold the complaint.\nNor is it, in my opinion, necessary that the county should be made a party in order to maintain this action, were they entitled to the money. In most of the cases cited, which related to the rights of municipal corporations, these municipalities were not made parties. Such was the fact in reference to Dublin, Brighton, Liverpool and Leeds.\nThe averment of collusion in the complaint was not essential, and this, as well as such portions of the com plaint as set forth, facts not material to sustain the cause of action, upon the grounds already discussed, are redundant, irrelevant and immaterial. They furnish no ground for demurrer, and might have been stricken out, if a motion had been made at the proper time, or may now be disregarded as surplusage.\nThe question raised as to the disposition to be made of the money which may be realized if a recovery be had, is of no importance, if, as the authorities hold, the action can be maintained. It may, however, be assumed, I think, that the legislature of the State, in its wisdom, will make such provision for its appropriation as will be just and proper, and the circumstances of the case demand.\nSome other questions are raised by the defendant\u2019s, counsel, but these are not of sufficient importance to demand discussion.\nThe order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs, with leave to amend in twenty days after service of order, upon payment of costs.\nThe decision of the case of People v. Connolly depends mainly upon the questions already discussed, and as no additional points are presented, which authorize a reversal of the order in the latter case, it must, for the reasons stated, be affirmed, and the same order made in all respects.\nPotter, J.\nThis case involves, in its determination, simply the question of the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as a pleading.\nEliminating all unnecessary verbiage of statement, the action is one simply brought against the defendants as trustees and public officers created by the legislature. It is brought to recover moneys in their hands, which, as it is alleged, they, by corrupt and fraudulent conduct, and by unlawful combination and conspiracy with others, have appropriated to their private use ; for breach of trust; and for fraudulent omission of official duty. The cases have been thoroughly, elaborately and ably argued, both upon oral and printed briefs, and we have given to the examination of the questions a liberal share of time, and the exercise of our best judgment. The detail of facts set forth in the complaint, shows the appointment to office of the defendants, and the manner in which they obtained the moneys, and the manner by which, and the manner in which, the fraud and conspiracy, and breach of official duty was accomplished.\nAll these facts are admitted by the demurrer.\nTo these admitted facts, the defendants interpose four several defenses ; the first of which, I think, only, it will be necessary to examine at much length.\nThe second defense is, that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. This, I think, has no merit. I do not stop to discuss it. A public officer has made a disposition of moneys in his hands, received for public purposes, in a manner unauthorized by law. In other words, he has been guilty of a breach of trust, in the misappropriation of such moneys. In such a case he ought to be made liable to somebody, for malversation in office. A good cause of action clearly exists upon the facts as set forth.\nThe third defense: \u201cthat it appears upon the face of the complaint that there is a defect of parties defendants, in the omission of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of Mew York,\u201d is not, in my opinion, well taken. It neither appears in the complaint that the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of said' city, as a body corporate, participated in the alleged fraud, conspiracy, and breach of official duty, nor is it shown therein that such corporate body have any title to, or interest in, the moneys so raised, and so fraudulently obtained and converted. The legis lature, in this act, conferred no title to the moneys which came to the defendants\u2019 hands, upon such city corporation; they are not named in the act, and neither the source from which it was raised nor the agents by whom it was obtained were made subject to the corporate control of such city, or are liable to them for breach of duty.\nThe fourth defense: \u201cthat it appears upon the face of the complaint that there is a defect of parties defendants, in the omission of the board of supervisors of the county of Few York, \u201d is not, in my opinion, well taken.\nThe complaint shows no title to this purloined money in the board of supervisors.\nThey were not made the direct agent or instrumentality to raise it, to hold it in trust, to disburse it, or to render an account for it, or to call this special board to account to them, nor did the statute confer any title to it upon the board of supervisors. They were not made responsible for its honest appropriation, or required in any manner to intermeddle with it, or with any balance or surplus of it, remaining over; nor were they authorized, by suit or otherwise, to call the commission who were intrusted with it to account, or to prosecute for any fraudulent embezzlement, larceny or mismanagement of the fund so authorized to be raised, nor for any breach of trust or of official duty in regard to it. They were not made liable to pay the bonds. For does the fact, that they, the said board of supervisors, were made the subordinate instrumentality by the statute, under the taxing power of the government, to levy a tax, at a subsequent day, for the payment of the bonds so authorized to be issued, and upon which the money was raised, confer any title on them to the moneys so dishonestly obtained, and retained by individuals composing the special board of trustees, or quasi, corporation, created by the legislature for that special purpose.\nIf it shall turn out that the State alone is authorized to bring this action against the wrong-doers, then this objection is immaterial; then the action is properly brought against this board of auditors for the abuse of their public trust, and against their co-conspirators. If the attorney-general is not authorized to bring the action, then this objection also becomes immaterial; the action must fail upon that ground. This brings the examination, really, to the only question in the case\u2014the right of the people to bring the action.\nThe county of New York, previous to the passage of the act in question, like other counties, had a prescribed general system of government, and had also a regular organization and method of raising means for the discharge of its liabilities and the management of its financial interests.\nThis system was peculiar to itself\u2014certainly somewhat variant from that of other counties, because of its different and peculiar condition, but it was a system intended to be suited to its own especial necessities. It was, nevertheless, its own particular but general system.\nThe act in question was in one particular a new and, as its title expresses it, a \u201c further provision for the government of the county.\u201d\nThis new provision did not employ any established regular organization to that end, but created a new board with special powers to perform certain specific acts, which, when performed, of course exhausted the powers conferred upon this special commission.\nIn performing these specified acts, they were, by operation of law, constituted trustees of the moneys so to be raised. True, the organization called the board of supervisors were directed in the act to provide, by the usual method of taxation, the means to pay the moneys for which this special commission should create a necessity; but the board of supervisors were thus but the subordinate agents of the special commission. It was in the pretended performance of the duties imposed by this special act, that this specially constituted board committed the acts charged in the complaint.\nIt will be seen that this auditing board, instead of personally performing that duty, by a resolution passed by them on May 5, 1870, delegated their trust, and resolved to take the certificate of their delegate as a substitution for their duty in this regard; in other words, refused to personally perform the duty.\nThe legislature, under the provision of section 2 of article X. of the Constitution, had power to create, and created, a new board of officers, and conferred upon them special powers authorizing them to perform certain acts and duties. This act was without any express provision for the accountability to the said board of supervisors, or to any other body.\nThe legislative power in this respect is sovereign.\nThe right of taxation is a power inherent in the government, and may be legitimately exercised in the way provided by this act, and it is not restrained by the constitutional provisions, that private property shall not be taken for public purposes without just compensation, nor from providing just such a system of taxation. Taxation is based upon the principle or theory that the tax-payer receives a corresponding benefit from the object for which the tax is raised, or on which the tax is to be expended.\nIn the case at bar, the statute assumes that there were liabilities existing against the county of New York, which it was the duty of toy-payers to meet; it appointed an independent commission, or special board of three individuals, who were required to audit such liabilities, and conferred upon them the power to raise the means of payment thereof, by the issue of revenue bonds of the county of blew York, separate from every other known organized system to that end. It then provided a plan of taxation through the board of supervisors of said county, as one of the instrumentalities of this new system, to pay the said bonds. Ho moneys were obtained, or to be obtained, in any other method than from the sale of bonds ; and no more money could lawfully be raised than Just sufficient to pay the claims that were to be audited, though it was conceded on the argument that new bonds had been issued under the act of 1871, having a longer period to run, as a substitution for the bonds of 1870, upon which the moneys were raised ; the fraud alleged to have been committed was in the issue of the first bonds.\nThese provisions, together, completed a special system of taxation upon the tax-payers of the county of New York. It was, upon the face of the statute, for the legitimate purpose of relieving the tax-payers from a then existing liability of indebtedness.\nThe omission of the legislature to provide, in this enactment, a plan or provision by which to call the agents of this system to account, and guard against the abuse of power conferred, creates no right or title in any other known organized body of men, corporate, or quasi corporate, to sue for the abuse of trust, or for the moneys which have been so fraudulently raised and misappropriated by the members of the special commission. The statute conferred the power, without any accountability to the board of supervisors ; but surely, we cannot assume it to have been the intention of the legislature to place this body of commissioners, and the trust committed to them, above the power of the law to reach them ; or the trust committed to their care to be beyond its protection. We must not assume that the jurisprudence of the State is so defective and inefficient; or that the legislature intended to permit these trustees to appropriate to their own use the money intrusted to their charge for other purposes.\nThis, doubtless, was an abuse, or omission, in legislation ; but I can find no more legal reason in this case for joining the board of supervisors as defendants, than for joining the board of police, or fire commissioners.\nThe board of supervisors was a mere instrumentality to carry out the behests of this special commission (People v. Flagg, 46 N. Y., 405).\nIt may not be denied that this money, in moral rights, and in equity and good conscience, should go into the treasury of the county of New York, and be applied to the extinguishment of the bonds so fraudulently issued and so unjustly imposed upon its taxpayers ; and in that moral sense, the county has an interest in obtaining the money to that end.\nBut before this court, is it the legal right of this county to be made such party, that is the question. It is the absence of any legal title, and legal interest conferred by statute law; it is the absence of all legal statute remedies by which they can obtain this money, and it is the act of collusion and conspiracy of the officers composing the organized authorities of the city and county that represents her legal interest, and which refuses to prosecute the offenders ; it is these causes which take from the county the power, as well as the disposition to prosecute, which present the legal question as to the necessity that the county should be represented as a party to this action ; and that the court are to consider. That it would have been most appropriate and wise for the legislature to have made a provision in the act rendering this special board liable to account to the board of supervisors is, and may well be, conceded, but it is not in the power of this court to supply the defect. It is not within the legitimate sphere of judicial action to add what the legislature have omitted.\nJudicial legislation is ever (as it should be) odious.\nThe legislature chose to create a special board without providing for their accountability to any one. Nor are we any the more called upon to travel beyond our sphere of duty, in order to answer the repeated interrogatory, \u201c To whom does this money belong ?\u201d That question is not directly raised by the demurrer. It would be equally legitimate to inquire\u2014Does it belong to the defendants ? and more appropriate to inquire\u2014Does it belong to the board of supervisors ? Can they bring suit for it ? and, can the State bring this action ? But two questions really arise in the case in testing the quality of the pleadings, viz: 1. Is a cause of action set forth in the complaint ? and, 2. Is the plaintiff authorized to bring the action ? What shall become of the money when recovered, is not in issue. This inquiry is calculated to divert the mind from the only legitimate question in the case, viz: Is the pleading good ? It suffices upon this point, that we are unable to see, as is alleged, that the board of supervisors have a title to the money sued for which imperatively requires that they should be made parties defendants.\nIt is claimed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the interest of the board of supervisors is shown in the fact, that the first deposit of the money raised upon the said bonds, having been made with the chamberlain of the city of New York, who, by virtue of his office, happens to be, and is, county treasurer, gave title to it to the county. To this it may be answered, this special board only, being responsible for the money, had power to deposit the proceeds of such bonds in any bank, or with other safe or convenient depository, and to draw it out again according to any plan or system they chose to adopt. No person had a right to use or apply it, except upon the authority or order of this board, by their proper officer, to whom it was entrusted. If this special board or commission chose to \"select any bank, or any city and county officer, or other instrumentality for convenience, for deposit or payment according to a prescribed form, such a selection by no means changed the title to the money. It was the comptroller only who was to raise the money, and he alone was to pay these claims, and they were to be paid by Mm, by moneys to be raised upon these bonds. He was the sole custodian of the money, not the county treasurer. This was a fund created by a special act; it was to be paid out only upon the official act of an audit by the board, of which he was one. It was to be applied to a specific public purpose, and was payable only by a designated public officer, appointed for that express purpose by the State.\nThis appointment made him a trustee of that fund. If he paid it into the county treasury in any other sense than as his depository, it. was so paid contrary to law, and no title thereto by that act was conferred upon the county.\nIf the act of the legislature did.not create or designate this fund to be one for which the board of supervisors was responsible, or confer upon them an interest in it, the act of the comptroller in selecting a city officer as a depository, did not work a change in the title to it.\nSo too, it is claimed, that the form given to the bonds issued by this special board, it being in the name of the county, and binding the county to its payment, and the form of its authentication being that the board of supervisors had caused the same to be signed by the comptroller, and countersigned by the mayor, and sealed with the common seal of the board, is all but conclusive, that moneys to be raised thereby, were the moneys of the county, .for which moneys only the board of supervisors could bring an action. , The statute created the county liability to pay the bonds, but I am unable to see that this special board of trustees, by any action of theirs, or by the forms they employed to carry out the object of the statute, had power to change the title to those moneys, or, that the agencies or instrumentalities they employed in its management could have the claimed effect, even if that board had intended thereby to effect such a change. Equally immaterial is it, in determining this demurrer, to inquire what is to be done with the money when recovered ? It is not a question raised by the pleading.\nIf the board of supervisors have no legal title , to these moneys, it would be equally pertinent to inquire, what would they do with the money if recovered in their name ?\nThe injury complained of in this case, is not one that affects the corporate interest of the county of Mew York, or their corporate property. In contemplation of law, no money, arising from this source, was paid' into the county treasury : none was authorized to be paid in. Mo money for this purpose has been drawn from the county treasury.\nIt is an injury which does affect, and has affected, and in future will affect, the private interests of the future tax-payers of said county ; but the parties so injured, it is well conceded, have no remedy by action at law for the injury sustained (Doolittle v. Supervisors of Broome Co., 18 N. Y., 155).\nThey can neither individually nor jointly, nor in any corporate capacity, as present tax-payers, bring the action (Doolittle v. Supervisors of Broome Co., 18 N. Y., 159; Attorney-General v. Eastlake, 11 Hare, 225). Up to this period of time, no direct private interest has been invaded. I understand the rule to be this : when an offense against the public has been committed, which includes a private injury, the private injury may be prosecuted for in the name of the injured individual ; but not so when the injury is not peculiar to himself, but affects a whole class of citizens alike. When the grievance consists in the illegal exercise of official public functions, it then requires that the action be prosecuted by the officer who has been appointed by law to sue in such cases.\nThe act of the legislature, upon its face, is a legal and valid act. It employed the instrumentality of a special board of officers, appointed by the sovereign power of legislation, to raise sufficient money, in a speckled manner, to discharge certain liabilities ; but it did not constitute any other body of men a forum or tribunal, to which they must account; nor did the legislature confer authority upon any other board, to vindicate the individual rights of the injured tax-payers, or give standing in court to anybody to sue for abuses of trusts. Assuming that the board of supervisors of the county of New York have corporate capacity, like other counties, their powers of suing, and of being sued, are both conferred and limited by statute. They can only sue and be sued in the manner prescribed by law (2 Rev. Stat., 364, marg. p., \u00a7 1), and no county, through their board of supervisors, shall possess or exercise any corporate powers, except such as are enumerated in the Revised Statutes, in the same chapter ; or such as shall be specially given by law (Id. \u00a7 2).\nNo power is found, conferred by law, which confers upon the board of supervisors the right to sue or be sued for such misconduct as is charged against the defendants in this action. Even the power to sue and be sued is limited. They are not liable to be sued for debts due from the county (Boyce v. Supervisors of Cayuga, 20 Barb., 295; Chase v. County of Saratoga, 33 Id., 607; Martin v. Supervisors of Greene, 29 N. Y., 647).\nIf they cannot sue or be sued for this fraud, how can they be sued for the moneys obtained by it\u2014how can they be necessary defendants?\nI am not able to see in the fact that because the future tax-payers of the county of New York are made to pay liabilities through the form of taxation, by reason of the bonds issued by this special legislative commission, that the board of supervisors therefore become parties in interest in the moneys so obtained upon the bonds, and so fraudulently appropriated by the defendants.\nNor can I see, in the fact that the board of supervisors are made one of the instrumentalities of raising by taxation, in aid of this special commission, the means to pay such bonds, that they, as a corporation, have an interest in the moneys previously obtained and previously converted or stolen. They are made the subordinates, not the superiors, of this special commission.\nThe whole plan or system of raising the money in question was a new and special legislative scheme or device; the board created acted under the authority, if not by the command of the sovereign authority of the State. The authority was to issue bonds, raise money and pay liabilities, but it cannot be held that, because the taxation to meet the liability created for that purpose was to be effected through the instrumentality of the board of supervisors, or other officers named, that the latter had any interest in the fund so to be raised.\nNo objection is raised by the demurrer that the taxpayers of the county, who are to pay the bond-holders who advanced their money, are not made parties defendants, and we therefore take no time to discuss such propositions. We proceed, then, to the real point In the case.\nThe first objection raised by the demurrer I regard as the main and real question, viz : \u201c That it appears upon the face of the complaint that the plaintiffs have not legal capacity to sue in this action.\u201d\nThe action is brought by the people of the State of New York, by their attorney-general, as plaintiffs, against the defendants, for negligence of official duty and fraudulent misconduct, and, by a conspiracy, of fraudulently obtaining and receiving, and fraudulently appropriating the moneys raised by them as public officers, under the authority of a statute of the legislature of the State. The negligent omissions and the fraudulent breach of duty by which the acts were committed, are sufficiently stated in the complaint, and are sufficient to create a liability in favor of the proper party; and the demurrer, for the purpose of this review, admits the facts charged.\nThe simple question, then, is, can the attorney-general of this State bring and sustain this action in the name of the people of the State?\nHas the State, in its character of protector, and as the natural and governmental defender of the whole people, and of each class and portion of them, a right to intervene by action to that end?\nThe counsel for the defendants meet this question, first, by citing section 111 of the Code of Procedure, which provides \u201c That every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,\u201d &c., and insist that the people of the State of New York have no interest therein.\nIt can hardly be claimed that this provision of the Code destroys the right of the State of New York to bring actions in behalf of the people in all that class of cases, in which at common law, that right then existed, nor that it extends to that class of actions, or to actions which cannot be brought under the practice established by the Code. Section 468 of the Code expressly provides that if a case shall arise in which an action for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong, cannot be had under that act, the practice heretofore in use may be adopted, so far as may be necessary to prevent a failure of justice. This would be just that case. But the right of the attorney-general to prosecute was neither conferred nor taken away by the Code. It does not abrogate his right, and is not repugnant to its exercise. In this particular, I concur with the opinion of the court, in People v. Miner, 2 Lans., 399, \u201cThat there is nothing in the Code which manifests the intention to take from the attorney-general any of his common law powers.\u201d\nAnother of the answers to this position is, that it was a rule of the English common law, that the attorney-general is a necessary party, in all suits in which the crown is interested, and in this State, by our statute (1 Rev. Stat., 179), it is made the duty of the attorney-general to prosecute and defend all actions, in the event of which the people of this State shall be interested.\nThis places him, in our State, in the same relation to the government as does the common law in England.\nThe complaint alleges, and the demurrer admits, that the State, acting through its legislature, and upon the faith of the State, has authorized a special board or commission of officers, appointed by themselves, one of whom was authorized to issue certain bonds, and upon which bonds the credit of the county of New York is pledged that they shall be paid at maturity; that such bonds have been issued by such appointees and officers; that the proceeds have been stolen, appropriated or embezzled by a conspiracy of the said appointees or public officers, and certain co-conspirators; that the proceeds are traced to the hands of the defendants; that the county of New York, through the proper and legitimate authorities, has exhausted all means of taxation, by all the powers provided by law, to pay the said bonds ; and that they cannot pay them ; that such bonds can only be paid by another exercise of the sovereign power of the State, through further measures of taxation; or by an action brought by the State, by their attorney-general, to recover such proceeds from the hands of the officers so appointed by the sovereign power; and, that this peculiar necessity and state of things imposes upon the State the political obligation and duty to exercise the right of the people, acting through their attorney-general, according to the laws of the land, to bring this action to demand and recover possession of the proceeds of the said bonds, now so unlawfully in the hands of the defendants; and this duty and necessity, it is claimed, show such an interest in the people, as authorizes the bringing the action in their name.\nIt is also alleged in the complaint, stands admitted, and is viewed as another necessity for bringing the action, that the defendants, acting in fraudulent collusion with the local authorities of said city and county of New York, to wit, with the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of New York, of which corporation the' defendant Connolly is a member, and with the board of supervisors of said county, of which body the defendant Tweed is a member, with the purpose to impede, embarrass and delay, and, if possible, to defeat any action in behalf of the people, and to enable the defendants to escape from the pursuit of justice, through the direction of the mayor of the city, Hall, he, the said mayor, directed the corporation counsel of the city of New York to commence six several actions against themselves in the supreme court\u2014three in behalf of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York ; one against each of the defendants, Tweed, Connolly, and one against Hall, the mayor, solely, and three other actions in behalf of the board of supervisors of the county of New York\u2014one against each of said last named defendants, and Hall, solely. That the'said six actions were intended to embrace, in point of form and substance, claims for satisfaction of all the frauds of the defendant Tweed, official or otherwise, mentioned or referred to in the complaint in this action, and all other liabilities of the said Tweed, Connolly, and Mayor Hall, for which any action or recovery might be obtained against them or any of them ; but that the said six actions were commenced fraudulently, in bad faith, and will not and cannot be prosecuted fairly, beneficially, or usefully to the said people, or to any public interests, inasmuch as the said Hall (who directed the said actions) is governed by such evil designs and intent, and has complete control over the said counsel to the corporation. And they further allege that no other suit, action or proceeding can or will be had or taken by any other officer or authority of the said city or county, for the purpose of redressing the said frauds and wrongs against the people of the State of New York, and its authority, and the rights and property of its citizens, or of recovering the public moneys so fraudulently appropriated by the defendants. But, on the contrary, the said Hall, mayor, &c., and all other officers of said city and county, having any power or authority in the premises, intend and design to prevent any such action, suit or proceeding. or any redress or recovery.\nThis fraudulent combination and collusion of the defendants with the local authorities is alleged as a fact, and is urged as another reason why it became the duty of the people to institute this action in their name. This allegation must also be taken to be true.\nNot less so here, than in England, is the act of a public body, whether corporate or incorporate, acting as trustees for the public interests which affect injuriously a whole community, a public wrong which the sovereign power is bound to redress. I think it may be laid down as a legal proposition, that when a public right or interest is invaded, which requires vindication by judicial proceedings, and especially in cases in which, either no other remedy exists at common law, or when, by collusion, or by fraudulent design, the constituted authorities whose duty it may be to bring an action, refuse to prosecute, the attorney-general, representing the State in its sovereign capacity, may sue, and that whether the injury to the public interests affects the whole people, or any particular or limited organization of them. If this be not so, there may be wrongs without remedies. There is a class of cases in the English court of chancery, where it is found that the sovereign power intervenes to represent the injured parties, for the reason that they are prevented from coming into the court upon their own account; and no other legal party can be found to represent them (Attorney-General v. Compton, 1 Young & C., 416); but without such authority, I think the principle is elementary.\nIt would, I think, be a reproach, indeed, to our system of jurisprudence, to declare that it provided no remedy for such an atrocious wrong, as that complained of in this case, and as is admitted upon the record. Unless the statute cited by the defendants cuts off all remedy, I think our jurisprudence is not subject to that reproach. Can it be admitted that the sovereign power of this State is without the power, without a remedy, to protect itself and its citizens against the wrongs committed by its own agents, appointed to perform a public trust ? I think not. The only question then is, can that remedy be enforced by the plaintiff?\nThe anomalous character of the action, or the novelty of the particular complaint, in which the cause of action is set forth, is no objection to its maintenance, provided the injury set forth is cognizable by law; shown to have been inflicted; and is one for which the people, as plaintiff, can bring the action. The statute, it is claimed, requires the real party in interest to bring the action.\nAssume, then, that there must be a real party in interest. What is the character of that interest? And who is that real party? It is not the suffering taxpayers, as we have shown, who can be such party. No taxes have yet been paid on this account; it may be, that not one of the present tax-payers may be such when the tax shall be assessed, or when the bonds become due; and they cannot now allege that an injury is done to them.\nIf it were so, still it is settled that they could not maintain the action (Doolittle v. Supervisors of Broome Co., 18 N. Y., 155; Roosevelt v. Draper, 23 Id., 318, 323; 29 Id., 647; 33 Barb., 607). Our laws furnish them no relief.\nThe statute under color of which the fraud was committed, was a valid statute upon its face. No subsequent larceny of the money by these officers changes its validity. It is not the bond-holders, who have advanced their money in good faith under the provisions of a valid statute, that can bring the action. As yet they have hot suffered. Besides the faith and credit of the county of New York is legally pledged for the payment of the bonds.\nThey sustain no injury until the maturity of the bonds, and default in the payment of interest (18 Wend., 28, 77; 34 N. Y., 30). It is not the city corporation, as we have already shown.\nIt is not the body called the board of supervisors of the county, as we have also attempted to show. They have no such interest as entitles them to sue for the alleged fraud and breach of official duty of another independent board. It is not a fraud against that quasi corporate body. They are not made, by law, the general guardians or protectors of the rights and interests of the people of the county, or clothed with authority to sue for injuries inflicted upon them; much less are they the guardians of that distinct and separate portion of the people called tax-payers of the county.\nThe grievance is not common to all the people; many of the inhabitants are not tax-payers, and there are, doubtless, many tax-payers who are not inhabitants of the county. That portion who are not taxpayers, are in no way interested in the question (Town of Guilford v. Cornell, 18 Barb., 639). Therefore, the importance of holding the board of supervisors strictly to the powers conferred upon them by statute, and to the power to sue and be sued only in cases so expressly authorized.\nThey possess no common law powers which authorize them to sue; and neither by common law or by statute are this board the representative of private interests.\nSee City of Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., 12 Pet., 98, 99; 16 Ohio St., 320; 7 Ohio, 12; (Hammond), Cond., 366. The injury is not one affecting the corporate treasury of the county.\nThe injury consists in the fraudulent issue of bonds by the board of auditors to an excessive amount. Had they been issued for only the true amount, no injury would have occurred. The money raised thereon was not for the corporate treasury of the county. The board of supervisors had no right to exercise control over it, or over the officers authorized to raise it, or to apply to it county purposes. The excess of money, raised by the special board of anditors, certainly was not raised by authority of law, or for the benefit of the county; nor for certain creditors of it; and it cannot be shown that any power or authority exists at law by which the county or its board of supervisors became possessed of a legal title thereto, for which they could bring an action upon the bonds, or for the moneys raised thereon; and I find nothing in the act of 1864, ch. 405, \u00a7 3, that applies to or changes the effect of the provisions of the act under which the alleged frauds were committed.\nThis act of 1864, upon its face, makes each taxpayer a cestui qui trust, equally, of the common council of the city, and of the board of supervisors of the county. But of what ? It also makes each of these organized bodies, equally, and makes the several members thereof, trustees of the tax-payers. But of what does it make them trustees ? \u201cOf the property, funds, and effects of the said city and county, so far as such property, funds, and effects are or may be committed to their charge or control.\u201d If this was a valid act, which is denied ; if it was in full force, and had application, which is also denied, it was still an act subject to be changed by the legislature ; and this is what was done. The legislature, by the act of 1870, took from these organized corporations and the members thereof, the trust so committed to them, and to their charge, and conferred the trust and committed all such property for a specified purpose, to a new commission, authorizing the latter to create liabilities upon the taxpayers. To this extent the act of 1870 dissolved the trust committed to the common council, and the board of supervisors so created by the act of 1864, and the act of 1870 omitted to make the tax-payers the cestui que trusts of this new commission, the board of auditors, or of any one of them. So that neither the board of supervisors of the county, nor the common council of the city, could be accountable as trustees for the acts of the board of auditors ; and therefore, they have no interests in those moneys as trustees, so as to entitle them to sue for them.\nNor do I think the Revised Statutes (vol. 2, p. 473, marg. p., \u00a7 105 [92]) extends to this case. That section only gives authority to the board of supervisors to bring actions upon contracts made with them or their predecessors in their official character ; to enforce any liability or duty enjoined by law to such officers or the body they represent, and to recover damages to the property or right of such officers or the body they represent.\nIf I am in error in this construction, it will be shown hereafter that it does not affect the right of the attorneygeneral to bring this action.\nThis special commission, appointed by the legislature, whether or not they were a corporation, or a quasi corporation, it is not material to inquire. It is sufficient to say they were created by an act of the State, public officers, and they were invested with certain specified powers as such, to be exercised for special and limited purposes; but it was nevertheless clearly an office of public trust, to be executed for confessedly public purposes. They were not created the agents of the county of New York, or of the board of supervisors in their corporate capacity (Lorillard v. Town of Monroe, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.], 395). The county could not be sued or made responsible for the manner in which they discharged or used the duties of their office, for their breach of duty, for misfeasance or nonfeasance, or for frauds, collusions, conspiracy or embezzlements of money. This special board of audit were not county officers (see Constitution, Art. 10, \u00a7 2). As the legislature possessed the power under this article and section of the Constitution to appoint these officers, they were as truly public officers when so appointed as the highest official functionaries in the State.\nThe legislature, under the constitution, had no power to appoint or make \u201c county officers.\u201d\nNor had this board of auditors power, in the exer cise of their functions, to act as \u201ccounty officers\u201d (Sheboygan Co. v. Parker, 3 Wall. U. S., 93), even though the exercise of their powers did relate immediately to the interests of the county. How, then, could any organized body of county officers call them to account?\nNor is it necessary to call them State officers because they were appointed by the State; it is sufficient that they were public officers\u2014administrative officers. It was within the provision of the government of the State, by legislation, to pass acts to provide for the welfare of the whole community, and to secure the interests of all her citizens or of any portion of them, of any municipality within it. The power of the government over all the property within its limits for this purpose was never surrendered, and the government of the county of New York is only a part of the State organization to that end, subordinate to that of the State (People v. Flagg, 46 N. Y., 404-5).\nThe municipality of the county of New York cannot allege that the legislation in question was not for the public good.\nThe legislature is the conclusive and final judge of what the public interest and general good require to be done and of what is needed for any particular purpose. They devised this new machinery under the taxing power of the State, and they conferred upon their appointees important public functions. The right of the board of supervisors to exercise power over the property within her limits is only to the extent conferred by statute, and is subordinate to and subject to the supreme authority of the State, so far as the latter chooses to exercise her power by legislation within constitutional limits for the public interests (Ib.).\nWhen the State has so exercised her power by legislation and by the selection of its own agents pr officers, unless such new officers are made accountable to the local organizations of the county, the latter possesses no power over them (Town of Guilford v. Supervisors of Chenango, 13 N. Y. [3 Kern.], 149; Davidson v. Mayor of New York, 2 Robt., 244).\nIt is not because the acts of this new board, under provisions of this statute, lead to taxation of its citizens, that the money previously obtained by this board creates it the public money of the county.\nIf the trust had been faithfully executed by the officers, there would have been no money belonging to the county of New York, and it is not made plain that moneys obtained by breach of trust, and by the frauds, conspiracies and collusions of this special legislative board, enure to the benefit of a local organization, and thus authorizes them to sue or be sued. The means intended to be provided by this act of. the legislature, if honestly executed, were reasonably adapted to the purposes in view. It did not anticipate or authorize the possession of moneys beyond the actual needs to pay existing liabilities. These debts and liabilities are paid. All beyond that was obtained by fraud ; in fraud of the law; in fraud of the trust: and by fraud of these public officers against the future tax-payers.\nThe board of supervisors obtain no title to these moneys by reason of such a fraud; fraud does not confer title ; nor do its results enure to the benefit of this corporation. The board of supervisors had no control over the legal acts of this board of auditors. They have none over the moneys they secured by their illegal acts. This excess of money, beyond the necessities of the law, was not raised by authority of law, or for the benefit of the county of New York. The title to this money is no better than if it had been stolen. It is entirely unlike the cases of money raised by taxation through the regularly constituted authorities, under an illegal tax or assessment, and the proceeds paid into the county treasury, or expended for the uses of the county (Newman v. Supervisors of Livingston Co., 45 N. Y., 676; Bank of Commonwealth v. Livingston Co., cited in Id., 682; People ex rel. Mygatt v. Supervisors of Chenango, 11 N. Y. [1 Kern.], 563).\nThe machinery under which this outrage was committed was created by State, not county authority. It becomes the State to assert, if it may, its vindicatory power of bringing the offenders to justice. In nearly every organized representative body, corporate or quasi corporate, who are intrusted with public funds, whose officers are annually or periodically elected, the body has continued existence, notwithstanding the change of its officers. In these cases provision is made by law for the incumbent of the office in his own name or name of office, or in the name of the municipality he represents, to bring actions for moneys in the hands of the predecessor in office ; but such action can only be brought by virtue of the statute authority. No such provision exists by statute in relation to this board of audit.\nThey have no succession. They exhaust all their own powers as a board, and die, and the statute has omitted the power to call them to account. In this it differs from the regular organizations.\nBut the defendants place themselves upon the ground that the State has no right to bring the action.\nBut if it be true, and because neither of the classes of citizens mentioned, nor either of the corporations or organized bodies named, nor any other officer, or person, by statute, can sue these wrong-doers, or call them to account for this official wickedness, the law still will not afford them impunity; and it is not to be held so weak or defective that no remedy whatever exists against the transgressors (Adsit v. Brady, 4 Hill, 632).\nThe old common law maxim, \u201c Ubi jus, ibi remedium\u201d remains unimpaired. That there is no wrong without a remedy in the jurisprudence of New York, is a doctrine I am prepared judicially to assert. This maxim was a part of the common law of England, it followed our ancestors here, and became a part of the colonial law. It was adopted into the State Constitution of 1777, section 35, and it has never been abrogated. Lord Coke says, \u2018 \u2018 The law will, that in every case where a man is wronged and endamaged, that he shall have a remedie\u201d (Co. Litt., 197, b.\nThis maxim was regarded so valuable in English jurisprudence, that the judges invented a form of action purposely to carry it into effect, called an action on the case ; and for its further security, the Statute of Westminster, 2, in the 13th year of Edward I., chapter 24, was passed, to quicken the diligence of the clerks in chancery, whose duty it was to invent precedents in new cases, under some right requiring a remedy. This statute (13 Edward), gave direction to the clerks of chancery to agree in making such writs ; or the plaintiffs may adjourn it until the next parliament, by consent of men learned in the law: \u201cA writ,\u201d it says, \u201cshall be made, lest it might happen after that, the court should long time fail to minister justice to complainants.\u201d\nFrom thenceforth, until the adoption of our State constitution, and ever since, this maxim, \u201cthat there is no wrong without a remedy,\u201d has been the doctrine of the English and American system of jurisprudence.\nHere, no less than in England, and in the other civilized nations of the earth, is it the duty, of the State, in its sovereign capacity, and as protector of its citizens against wrong, when no other method is appointed by law, to furnish a remedy.\nLord Hardwicke, the distinguished lord chancellor of England, in the case of The Charitable Corporation v. Sutton and others, 2 Atk., 406, said, \u201c The tribunals of this kingdom are wisely formed, both of courts of law and equity, and so are the tribunals of most other nations; and for this reason there can be no injury but there must be a remedy, in all, or some of them, and therefore, I will never determine that frauds of this kind are out of the reach of the courts of law or equity; for an intolerable grievance would follow from such a determination,\u201d . . . \u201c nor will I ever determine, that a court of equity cannot lay hold of every breach of trust, let the person be guilty of it either in a private or public capacity.\u201d\nLord Redesdale, in the case of the Attorney-General v. City of Dublin (1 Bligh N.), said, \u201cIt is expedient in such cases that there should be a remedy, and highly important that persons in the receipt of public moneys should know that they are liable to account in a court of equity, as well for misapplication of, as for the withholding the funds.\u201d\nThen he supposes a case of one who, having some charge of such funds, embezzles or misapplies them, or who rendered imperfect or fabricated accounts of them, and said, \u201c Could not the attorney-general, upon discovery of the fraud, proceed by information to recover the moneys?\"\nIn the case of Innes v. Lansing (7 Paige, 586), Chancellor Walworth said, \u201cWhenever the legislature creates new rights in parties, for the protection and enforcement of which rights the common law affords no effectual remedy, and the statute itself does not prescribe the mode in which the rights are to be .protected, this court, in the exercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction, is bound to give a party the relief to which he is eguitably entitled under the statute.\nActions in the name of the people, by the attorney-general, against corporations for abuse of authority, are common in this State (People v. Mayor of New York, 9 Abb. Pr., 253; The same v. The same, 10 Id., 144; Attorney-General v. Cohoes Co., 6 Paige, 133, are instances).\nThe role laid down in Attorney-General v. Compton (1 Young & C., 416), is this : \u201cthat where property is affected by a public trust, it is, in the hands of those who hold it, devoted to that trust, and that the crown is entitled by its officer to intervene for the purpose of asserting in behalf of the public, and the public interest, that public right which probably no individual can be found effectually to assert, even if the interest were such as to allow it.\u201d\nIf this remedy, in behalf of the State, does not exist in this case, it may be safely asserted, that there is no body, officer, functionary, or person found, upon whom the right devolves. If this be so, then it appears to me, indeed, that it must be said the public are remediless against such wrongs; and it may then be proclaimed, that in the State of New York alone, that wise and ancient maxim of the common law, Ubi jus, ibi remedium, has been cast out of her jurisprudence.\nBut it does not follow, that because the State cannot be sued or made a defendant for the misfeasance of its agents, that it is not liable to its citizens for such a damage done to their interests; and the State may be' made a trustee for the citizens, in regard to such interests ; nor does it follow, that as trustee, it may not, as plaintiff, sue to recover such damage. In this case, under the exercise of the taxing power, it has authorized its agents to take private property of the citizens, and to the amount of the excess of property taken, it is done without making just compensation.\nThat the State cannot be sued does not relieve them from liability for the damages which they have illegally and unjustly inflicted upon the public. The State may prosecute, as plaintiff. The State, therefore, as we have said, owes a duty to the citizen to redress this injury and to discharge its liability so incurred. This creates not only an interest but also a duty to bring an action (See Coster v. Mayor, &c. of Albany, 43 N. Y., 399).\nThe question returns, have the people of this State such an interest in this action, that they, by their attorney-general, may prosecute it?\nWe have no statute which defines or limits the powers of the attorney-general of the State, or which changes the common law.\nWe have various statutes, which impose new duties, and confer new powers upon him ; and there is one general provision, mating it his duty to prosecute and defend all actions, in the event of which the people of this State are interested.\nHis powers were well understood, as they existed at common law in England.\nHe was allowed to prosecute, without limitation, impediment, or delay, all offenses or matters that immediately affected the interest of the State; insulted the sovereign ; scandalized the credit; or endangered the security of the government (see 2 Wood Lect., 335); and he was the special representative of the crown in filing informations to correct abuses, or misapplication of trust funds held for charitable uses; and of municipal funds raised by local taxation, for local purposes; which were regarded as funds of the proper administration of which the ting, as \u201c parens patriae,\u201d could demand an account, or remedy in a court of equity through his attorney-general. This was held, in the case of Attorney-General v. Brown (1 Swans. Ch.), opinion of Lord Chancellor Eldon, pp. 265, 300, 301, &c.\nThis common law was the law of our colonial government. The attorney-general under the colonial government, from 1684 to the year 1702, received, his appointment from the governor of the colony, and exercised his duties with no change of the common law. From the latter year until the revolution,.he was comm issioned by the crown. He still possessed all these powers, under the colonial government, without change.\nAt the adoption of the first constitution of this State, in 1777, it was declared, \" that such parts of the common law of England, and the statute law of England, and of Great Britain, and the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as did together form the law of the said colony on April 19, 1775, shall he, and continue, the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions, as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.\u201d\nWhile the legislature of this State have from time to time added new powers and duties to the office of attorney-general, I am not aware that they have ever abrogated or changed any of the powers of this officer that existed at common law in England and the colonies, in relation to such subjects as we have above referred to ; to wit, that of correcting abuses in the misapplication of trust funds for charitable uses, and which included municipal funds raised by local taxation; nor can I discover that such common law powers have become repugnant to the established laws and institutions of this State, so as to render them invalid.\nThe office of attorney-general, though an existing office, was not mentioned in the constitution of 1777, but in the constitution, a body of men, called \u201ca council of appointment,\u201d was created, and authorized to fill all offices not named in the constitution.\nSixteen different persons received appointment to the office of attorney-general from this power. Neither under subsequent constitutions, or acts of the legislature passed under them, has there been any change, limitation, or specification of the powers and duties of this office, except as to such new duties as have been from time to time created ; and in which, new powers were conferred for their due execution. His powers and duties, therefore, in my opinion, are now in this State, such as have existed at common law from a period long before our existence as a colonial or State government; and such as have existed and been, or might have been, exercised at all times since, with the exception of such new powers and duties as have been added by statute.\nUpon this point I entirely concur with what was said by the court, in the fourth department, in the case of the People v. Miner, 2 Lans., 399, viz: \u201cAs the powers of the attorney-general were not conferred by statute, a grant by statute of the same, or other powers, would not operate to deprive him of those belonging to the office at common law, unless the statute, either expressly, or by reasonable intendment, forbade the exercise of powers not thus expressly conferred. He must be held, therefore, to have all the powers belonging to the office at common law, and such additional powers as the legislature has seen fit to confer upon him.\u201d\nSo, too, it was held, by Hogeboom, J., in People v. Mayor of New York, 32 Barb., 102, as follows: \u201cWhere there is a clear violation of law, or a clear misuse or abuse of its corporate powers on the part of municipal corporations, the people, as representing the general public\u2014the body of citizens who are aggrieved \u2014are the proper parties to enforce such remedy. I am referred to three manuscript unreported decisions to the same effect, in the following cases: People ex rel. Peck v. Gardner, Morse and others, arising in the sixth judicial district, in which the opinion was written by Parker, J. ; another in the same district, in the case of People ex rel. Proctor v. Swartout, opinion by Mason, J. ; and another case, arising in the third judicial district, in the case of People ex rel. Thompson v. Benedict; this was at general term, held by Peck ham, Hogeboom and Miller, JJ. ; Hogeboom writing the opinion.\nThe rule is the same in the English courts. In the case of the Attorney-General v. Birmingham & Oxford Railway Co., the lord chancellor said: \u201cI have attended to all the cases that have been cited, and they all fall within well recognized principles, that where acts are being done injurious to the public interests, inasmuch as the public interests might otherwise altogether be neglected, the attorney-general was, in such case, the authority to represent the public (8 Eng. Law & Eq., 243).\nFrom what I have said, I think the following conclusions may be adopted from the case, as it is presented upon the pleadings to us :\n1. That the case shows an existing cause of action against the defendants.\n3. That under our system of jurisprudence, a remedy exists for this cause of action.\n3. That the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York have no such interest in the action as requires that they should be made defendants therein.\n4. That the board of supervisors of the county of New York have no such interest in the action as requires that they should be made defendants therein.\n5. That, by the law of the land, the people of the State of New York have such an interest in the action as entitles them to prosecute the same.\nFirst.\u2014It is the duty of the people of the State to bring the action.\nTaxation and the liability to taxation, through which the citizen contributes, or becomes liable to contribute his property to demands of the State, through the sovereign power of legislation for the public interests, is the price he pays for governmental protection, and for the safe enjoyment of the remainder of his estate.\nFor this consideration, the State, as the sovereign, owes a duty to the citizen, to afford him a protection against, injury and loss. These duties are correspondingly reciprocal. The duty of protection includes that of providing a remedy for injuries to person, life, liberty and property.\nIn this case, it is seen that the State, through its sovereign power of legislation, and the appointment to office thereby of a commission of its own, has by the action of such commission, created a pecuniary liability upon a portion of its citizens, to an amount exceeding six millions of dollars. The commission so appointed, have, by fraud, by combination and conspiracy, and under color of such legislation, created a liability upon such citizens, to an amount greatly exceeding the liabilities to be met, or the public necessities; that such liabilities were created by the said State commission, by the issue and sale of bonds, for the amount of which the citizen remains liable to taxation ; and the defendants, as such commission and officers, by such combination and conspiracy with others, and by fraud, and a breach of trust, have appropriated to their own use, and retain in their own hands, a large amount of the moneys so obtained, which, in good conscience and equity, should be recovered by action, and applied to relieve the citizens from a portion of their said liability.\nIn my opinion, it. is not only the ditty which the State owes to the injured citizen, but that it is the right, and within the authority of the people, to exercise the right; and by their constituted attorney to bring the action to recover the moneys so fraudulently obtained and held ; and I hold, that this duty, coupled with the right, and with authority to sue, is such an interest in the action, as is acknowledged by the law of the land ; and such as relieves it from all objection on this ground, if such ground could be urged ; which I think cannot.\nI think it is not necessary, in such a case, in an action for a breach of trust, to show that the State, as a corporate body, have the title to, or a corporate interest in the moneys sued for, to entitle them to bring the action. That is not the basis of their right or duty to prosecute. That is not the ground upon which the State assumes to stand. The right to bring this action, if it exists at all, is the well established rule of right and duty, by the common law ; the duty of protection of public interests against public agents invested with trusts.\nThis liability of public agents may arise as well from acts of omission as of commission.\nIt was said by Lord Hardwicke, in Charitable Corporation v. Sutton, 2 Atk., 405: \u201cIf some are guilty of gross non-attendance, and leave the management entirely to others, they may be guilty by this means, of the breaches of trust that are committed by others.\u201d\nIf then, it be true, that the responsible personal public duty, imposed by law upon this board of auditors, was intrusted by them to others, who committed the alleged frauds as is manifest from their resolution of May 5, 1870), this was a gross breach of trust. It appears by this resolution that they not only did not audit the accounts, as was their duty, but that they thereby agreed they would not audit them. That is, the law required of them the personal performance of a duty; they refused to perform it.\nThrough their refusal, immense frauds followed, to the injury of the public interests.\nLord Habdwicke, in the same case, farther said, \u201cBy accepting of a trust of this sort, a person is obliged to execute it with fidelity and with reasonable diligence ; and it is no excuse to say, they had no benefit from it;\u201d so, he said, \u201cit had been objected, that the court could make no decree upon several persons, that would he just; for every man\u2019s non-attendance or omission of his duty, is his own default, and that each particular person must bear such proportion as is suitable to the loss arising from his particular neglect, which would make it a power out of the court.\u201d\nHe answers this objection by saying, \u201c if, upon inquiry, it appear to be a supine negligence in all of them, by which gross complicated loss happens, I will never determine that they are not guilty.\u201d\nA trustee may be guilty of a breach of trust, from error or ignorance of his duty as well as by fraud and willful omission (Attorney-General v. Poole, 4 Mylne & C., 28, 29).\nThis trust was & personal tryst to the individuals to whom it was confided. It was their duty, personally, to perform it.\nIt was a violation of duty to delegate it, and the trustees became responsible for the abuses of their delegated agents.\nI do not propose to discuss at length the questions of the reciprocal duties and obligations that exist under government, between the government and the citizen, as to the right of support from the one and of protection from the other. I shall assume that among the duties the government owes to the citizen, is that of furnishing a remedy, civil as well as criminal, to protect Mm from wrongs inflicted upon him, as well as to punish the wrong-doer. This has been regarded as a duty by every civilized government.\nPuffendorf, whose authority on this subject was adopted as part of the English common law, says, \" Since the subjects are obliged to the bearing of taxes and the like burdens, on no other account but as they are necessary to defray the public expenses, &c., it is the duty of sovereigns, in this respect, to draw no further supplies than either the mere necessity or the signal benefit and interest of the State shall require ; and then they are to see that these impositions be levied according to the justest proportion, and that no immunities or exemptions be granted to certain persons, to the defrauding or oppression of the rest \u201d (Book 7, M. 9, \u00a7 10). And he holds it to be the farther duty of the sovereign to see that the way of gathering taxes be with as little charge as possible, \u201c and that much do not stick to the collector's fingers\u201d (Ib.). And further, that every subject may be able to recover his right by as short and cheap a process as can be contrived (Id., \u00a7 5). It is idle to talk about governmental protection to the citizen if the earnings of his industry be appropriated and his property be taken by the action of government, and by governmental agents acting under the sovereign power, enforcing, upon the one hand, the duty which the citizen owes to his government of support, without the exercise of the corresponding duty, and the enforcing of the reciprocal obligation by the government, on the other, in return\u2014that of furnishing protection and a remedy to redress the citizens\u2019 wrongs.\nLife, liberty and property are reckoned among the most valuable blessings of the citizen. He has no security of protection for the enjoyment of these, against encroachments made by the cunning of the strong and the combinations of the wicked, but that of protection from the laws and institutions of government, which shall be wisely administered by tribunals of justice furnished by the government, composed of men who shall be above fear and beyond reproach. What could be a greater inconvenience to the due administration of justice, or of reproach to a government, than the failure of justice from an acknowledged want of a remedy % There must, of necessity, not only be a remedy, but a jurisdiction adequate to deal with such cases.\nIt is, then, the duty of government to furnish the remedy for such a wrong ; and the duty of the courts so to apply it, as to protect the weak and defenseless against the strong, and to punish the insolence of governmental agents who shall be found guilty of such shameless encroachments and wanton injury as the case presents; without this protection to the citizen, government, to him, would be but a mockery and a shadow.\nAssuming then, that it is the duty of the State to bring an action, and that they have sufficient interest to sustain it, it remains to be seen whether they have the right to bring this action in their name by their attorney-general.\nThe English case of Attorney-General v. Brown, (supra), was, in its features, like the case at bar. It was an information by the State, to recover money, in the hands of commissioners appointed by an act of parliament, which money was the produce of an unauthorized assessment made upon the citizens of Brighton, one of the English towns, for the purpose of being applied to prevent encroachments of the sea. The commissioners abused the trust; made exorbitant and fraudulent assessments; appropriated the funds to their personal use; and when sued, demurred to the information.\nThat case, like the case before us, not only charged the unduly levying of taxes, but also, the misapplication of the funds when raised.\nThe defendants in that case claimed that the attorney-general was limited to bring such an action in cases relating only to charitable uses; such as are specified in the act of 43 Elizabeth ; and that this was merely a trust for a municipality, and did not come within that class of charitable uses.\nLord Chancellor Eldon, however, on a deliberate examination of the case, overruled the demurrer, and held the action well brought, and, as the report states, that it was a charitable use, and held the defendants liable. This was in 1818.\nSir John Leach, who was in that case counsel for the defendants, endeavored to show that because the fund raised was by taxation, and was to be applied to the benefit of a municipality, it could not be a charitable use, and that it did not come within the statute of Elizabeth, but his argument was overruled by the lord chancellor.\nAfterwards, in the year 1824, when Sir John Leach had become vice-chancellor, and the case of Attorney-General v. Heelis (2 Simmons & S., 77), came before him as vice chancellor, he held, in direct conflict with the opinion of the lord chancellor in Attorney-General v. Brown (supra), and in accordance with his own argument in the former case as counsel, viz: that it was the source from whence the funds are derived, and not the purpose to which they are dedicated, which constitutes the use charitable; and that when the funds were derived from rates or assessments to be levied upon the inhabtamts of a town, such was not a charitable use, though he admitted that the commissioners appointed by an act of parliament in such a case were trustees.\nSir John Leach, though ever regarded as a learned and able equity judge, could hardly entitle himself to the character of a modest one, when, in his opinion as vice chancellor, he attempted to overrule the earlier decision of the lord chancellor in the case of the Attorney-General v. Brown; and, as will be seen, the case of Attorney-General v. Heelis is not now, and has not since been regarded as authority in England. In a later case of the Attorney-General v. Corporation of Dublin, it was first decided in chancery, according to and upon the authority of the case of the Attorney-General v. Heelis.\nBut the case was appealed to the House of Lords, where it and. the case of the Attorney-General v. Heelis were reviewed, and where the former was reversed, and the latter overruled\u2014Lord Chancellor Eldon and Lord Redesdale delivering the opinions in the House of Lords (1 Bligh N. S., 312); Lord Eldon saying, \u201c That the mode in which the rate was levied was not to be looked at, but the purpose to which it was to be applied ; \u201d and Lord Redesdale concurring, also said, \u2018 \u2018 When the king, as parens patriae, may institute a suit by the attorney-general, it is not essential that the relators should join in the suit.\u201d\nIn a still later case of Attorney-Greneral v. Eastlake (11 Hare, 205, &c.), a review of all the cases on this point was made by Sir William Page Wood, vice chancellor, and the cases of Attorney-General v. Brown and The same v. Corporation of Dublin were again considered and affirmed, and the case of the Attorney-Greneral v. Heelis again overruled. The case of Attorney-Greneral v. Eastlake is also directly in point.\nIt was a case of commissioners appointed by an act of parliament; the moneys were obtained by taxation upon the municipality ; the object for which the money was to be raised and to which it was to be applied, was directed by statute, and the bill charged the misapplication of the funds. The vice chancellor began his opinion by saying, \u201cThe case was entirely concluded by authority as to the right of the attorney-general to interpose ; \u201d and, after holding that the doctrine of Sir John Leach, and the distinction he attempted to draw between gifts and moneys raised by taxation did not exist,\u2014in determining whether there was a charitable use in that case, he concludes, \u201cI cannot see that the source from which those moneys are here derived, viz : from taxation, can make any difference as to the charitable or public nature, and which would be attributable to the funds if they proceeded from a more limited sphere of bounty ; and if there be no distinc tion on that ground, the attorney-general is the person to represent those who are interested in that general and public, or charitable use\u201d\nConfirmatory of this view, is what is said in Attorney-General v. Mayor of Liverpool (1 Mylne & C., 201), which was an action brought against a municipal corporation, in which the question, among others, was raised, whether the attorney-general could bring such an action, and whether the court of chancery had jurisdiction to interfere with municipal corporations,\nThe master of the rolls held the affirmative of both propositions, and said : \u201cBut though a body having a corporate existence is capable of acquiring and possessing property, and therefore, also, of disposing of it; if property is held by a corporation as trustee ; if the corporation holds it, clothed with public duties, the court has always asserted its right to interfere ; \u201d and. he cites the case of Attorney-General v. Dublin, as authority for his decision.\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Aspinwall (2 Mylne & C., 617), the Lord Chancellor, Cottenham, said : \u201c If the property in question be subject to any trust, and if the appropriation complained of be not consistent with such trust, but applied to purposes foreign to it; and, if there be not a provision in the act, taking from the court of chancery jurisdiction in such cases, then it will follow that the attorney-general has the right to file the information, and to pray that the fund may be recalled, secured, and applied for the public ; or, in other words, the charitable purposes to which it is devoted.\u201d\nNor is it an objection, in the English court of chancery, that other parties are also interested, and may also bring an action for the injury ; that the attorney-general brings an action ; nor, that he joins with him such other interested parties ; so held, in the case of Attorney-General ex rel. Mayor of Leeds v. Mayor, Aldermen, &c., of Leeds (1 Craig & P., 1).\nNor by the recent cases, is it necessary, in order to confer jurisdiction upon a court of equity, that the trust should be what is technically called a charitable use ; it is sufficient if there be a special, or public trust for public purposes, and a breach. It did'not in England, as was argued, depend upon the Statute of William IV., called \u201cThe Municipal Reform Act,\u201d passed in 1835. It existed, and was so declared, long before that. See Attorney-General v. City of Dublin; Same v. Brown, supra. Nor does it affect the right of the attorney-general to bring the action in such a case, that a corporation or a private individual may also bring an action (Attorney-General v. Wilson, 1 Craig & P., supra). The question as to the right of the attorney-general to bring the action in this class of cases, has ceased to be discussed in England.\nBut one case is found in this State which is cited against this array of authority to show the converse of the rule of the right and duty of the attorney-general to bring the action before us.\nIt is a recent decision of a co-ordinate branch of this court (People v. Miner, reported in 2 Lans., 396).\nThis case stands alone in conflict with the English and American authorities I have cited above. This case, it is urged by the counsel for the defendants, is conclusive upon this court, upon the doctrine of stare decisis.\n. I am not wanting in respect to this doctrine\u2014never when it comes from a superior court, less so only in degree when it proceeds from a court of co-ordinate authority, especially so, one for whose learning and ability I entertain the most profound respect. But I can only decide this case upon the honest exercise of my own best and deliberate judgment, and upon my own clear convictions of well settled law.\nThe authorities which led that able court to the result as reported have, upon a most thorough examination, clearly established in my mind a contrary conclusion.\nThe proposition stated in that opinion, and laid down as the basis of the decision, is as follows: \u201cBut it seems to be considered in the English chancery that no property of a corporation is considered charitable, unless it has been given to the corporation by the government or individuals, to be devoted to the use of the public.\u201d\n\u201cHence,\u201d says the opinion, \u201cmoney raised by taxation is not within the control of the court \u201d (p. 408).\nThe learned judge then proceeds to cite the case of Attorney- General v. Heelis as authority for the rule laid down in that case, and says: \" It proceeds upon the distinction suggested, and is directly in point, and against the power of the court to intervene in cases of trusts not charitable.\"\nWe have previously shown that the case of Attorney-General v. Heelis was not law when it was pro nounced by Sir John Leach ; that it was expressly reviewed and overruled by the cases of Attorney-General v. Mayor of Dublin, in the House of Lords, and by the Attorney-General v. Eastlake, by the lord chancellor, and is found in conflict with nearly every other English and American decision.\nIn an examination of the same English cases by the late Judge Duer, he said, \u201c That the examination he had given to those (English) cases justified him in saying that the general rule to be extracted from them was this, that when the act of a municipal corporation . .. . affects injuriously the public at large\u2014that is, the entire community over which the corporate jurisdiction extends\u2014the attorney-general is a necessary party to the prosecution of the suit, and that it is only where the act, which in this sense is a public injury to par ticular individuals, that the action can be maintained in their names; \u201d and he added that this rule \u201c had a solid foundation of principle, and was sustained by very sound reasons of public policy.\nIt appears to me that the case of Duer, supra, is supported by the following cases in this State: Doolittle v. Supervisors of Broome, 18 N. Y., 162; Roosevelt v. Draper, 23 N. Y., 318; 16 How. Pr., 100; 7 Abb. Pr., 158; 10 Id., 144; 32 Barb., 102; and also 50 Penn. St., 100.\nI have had put into my hands a newspaper report of a case upon this same point, decided in the State of Missouri.\nIt appears in the St. Louis Republican of the date of July 13, 1873. In that case the right of the attorney-general to bring an action in the name of the people was fully discussed.\nThe English and New York authorities were all reviewed. The conclusion arrived at was the same as is given in this opinion ; and the case of the People v. Miner, in 2 Lans., was entirely dissapproved as authority.\nIf the views of the law I have expressed are sound, then it may be laid down as a general proposition, that in a court of equity, if the case is one of public trust, created by statute ; and, if there has been an abuse or breach of the trust by a public officer, whether appointed by statute or otherwise, unless the statute has empowered some one else to sue, or has declared or created a title to the moneys or property taken away or misappropriated, to be in some other person or body, the remedy by suit is in the people by their attorneygeneral.\nAnd various cases are found in the English authorities, in cases of breach of trust, where, though an individual may sue for a private injury done to his inter ests, the State has a concurrent right to prosecute, and this right is not affected by the private action.\nIt is urged upon the argument by the defendants' counsel, that even if relief can be had against the defendants in the name of the attorney-general, the remedy is only in the court of chancery; that this action is an action of law; that the complaint is, in form, strictly and only one in an action at law.\nIt is true the demand at the close of the complaint is for a judgment for money alone; and it is equally true, that the complaint is an anomaly in the system of pleading, and it may be said is not according to any prescribed form of past or present practice, and I think it is also true, that it is the court of equity that has jurisdiction of this class of actions. I am disposed to hold that upon the great principles of natural equity, such an action can be sustained, even in the absence of precedent or authority. It was held in the case of the People v. Aspinwall, supra, \u201cthat nothing is required to bring a case within the jurisdiction of chancery, tut that moneys are held for a public trust, and a breach of that trust; and see, also, Attorney-General v. Poole, 8 Clark & F., 409.\nIf we are right in the views of the law of equity which we have discussed, it is still seen that facts are set forth in the body of this complaint sufficient to show an equitable cause of action, though the demand of a relief has the characteristic of an action at law.\nBut we are taught by the more liberal system of pleading now in force, adopted by the Code, that it was expedient that the former system of pleading, as in cases at common law, should be abolished ; and the distinction between legal and equitable remedies should no longer continue ; and that a uniform course of proceeding is established.\nThe kind of action or proceeding, however, still depends on the nature of the right to be enforced, or wrong to be remedied. This must be shown by the facts which constitute the cause of action.\nIf these are sufficient, the form of the demand of relief does not destroy their force or change the character of the action. The complaint, certainly, is inartistic for an equity action, and perhaps for any other, but an error in the demand of relief neither changes the character of the action, nor affords ground for demurrer. Whatever imperfections may be found to exist in the form of the pleading, or as to want of certainty in its statement; or for surplusage in statement, might be the subject of a special motion, but these objections are not available before us.\nThere are several other objections raised which are merely technical, as to the form of action, and to the form of the pleading, but they are not so material as to require discussion or to make them a ground for sustaining the demurrers.\nFrom a review of all the cases in England, and in this State, to which I have had access, I have come to the conclusion, and hold, that the attorney-general is authorized to bring actions in the name of the people of this State for breaches of trust against all classes of public officers, and in cases of trusts for public purposes. That in the exercise of this right, he is not limited to actions against municipal officers, but it extends especially to special boards, or commissions appointed by the legislature to exercise a public trust; that the right to prosecute does not depend upon the source from which the moneys used have been derived ; whether from taxation, from creating liabilities to taxation, or from more limited sources, as from gifts, bequests, or donations ; but that it depends upon the purpose or object to which the fund is to be applied ; and, that the case at bar, being a public purpose, it comes within this rule.\nI hold, therefore, that upon the statement of facts set forth in the complaint, the defendants Tweed and Connolly, together with A. O. Hall, were by the legislature constituted a special public commission as a board of auditors, and were clothed as such board, with a public trust. That the moneys in question having been raised by them in the exercise of such public trust, it became their duty to apply them to the designated public use ; that they were guilty of a breach of that duty, and a breach of said trust, in the entire omission, as such board, to audit the accounts in question, and in the illegal delegation of this duty to irresponsible agents ; that they were guilty of a breach of duty in raising an amount of money greatly in excess of the public necessities, and in corruptly and fraudulently colluding and conspiring with others in the appropriating of and in using the said moneys upon false and fictitious claims, and in allowing large amounts thereof, through such instrumentalities, to be taken, used and appropriated to the individual use of the defendant Tweed ; that it is the duty of the people of the State to prosecute for this breach of trust by their duly constituted officer, the attorney-general; that this action is lawfully prosecuted ; that this court has jurisdiction of the said action ; and that the complaint contains facts ' sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\nThe result is, in my opinion, that the order of the special term overruling the demurrers, in both cases, should be affirmed, with costs."},{"case_name":"The Dollar Savings Bank v. United States","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/3432633\/","date":"1873-10-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Mr. Justice STRONG\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\nThe facts found by the special verdict are that the plaintiffin error is a banking institution created by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without stockholders or capital stock, and doing the business of receiving deposits to be loaned or invested for the sole benefit of its depositors; that the charter authorizes the retention o'f a contingent fund accumulated from the earnings to the extent of ten per centum of its deposits for the security of its depositors; that the bank has earned and added to the said contingent fund, or undistributed sum, from July 13th, 1866, to December 31st, 1870, one hundred and seven thousand dollars; and that such earnings were carried to and added to said contingent or undistributed fund semi-annually, on the first days of January and July in each year.\nUpon this state of facts, the first question presented is whether the act of Congress of July 13th, 1866, which was an amendment to the Internal Revenue law, authorizes the levy and collection of a tax upon the accumulated earnings carried to the contingent fund. It is very plain that the first intent of the act was to impose a tax upon all the earnings, income, or gains, of the institutions mentioned therein. The language of its one hundred and twentieth section is, \u201c There shall be levied and collected a tax of five per centum on all dividends in scrip or money thereafter declared due, whenever and wherever the same shall be payable to stockholders, policy-holders, or depositors, or parties whatsoever, including non-residents, whether citizens or aliens, as part of the .earnings, income, or gains of any bank, trust company, savings institution, and of any fire, marine, life, inland insurance company, either stock or mutual, under whatever name or style known or called in the Uuited States or Territories, whether specially incorporated or existing under general laws; and on all undistributed sum or sums made and added during the year to their surplus or contingent funds\u201d This tax the banks, trust companies, savings institutions, and insurance companies are required to pay, and they are authorized to deduct it from all payments made on account of any dividends or sums of money that may be due and payable as aforesaid. It is, however, only so much of the tax as is levied upon dividends or sums of money due and payable to stockholders, policy-holders, or depositors, &c., which the}' are authorized to deduct. Thus it appears the tax is laid upon two subjects, \u2014 the one dividends or sums due and payable, and the other the undistributed surplus of gains or earnings carried to a surplus or contingent fund. These subjects, though together making up the entire net earnings, are distinct from each other; and they are thus treated throughout the section as well as throughout other sections of the act. If the portion of the act which we have quoted were all, it would not admit of a doubt that both these subjects \u2014 the dividends, or annual or semi-annual payments, aud the sums added to the contingent fund \u2014 are made taxable.\nIt is argued, however, that savings institutions were relieved by the proviso to the section. That, of course, is to be construed in connection with the section of which it is a part, and it is substantially an exception. It takes out of the operation of the body of the enactment that which otherwise would be within it. It restrains the generality of the previous provisions. Its language is: \u201cProvided that the tax upon dividends of life insurance companies shall not be deemed due until such dividends are payable; nor shall the portion of premiums returned by mutual life insurance companies, nor the annual or semi-annual interest allowed or paid to the depositors in savings banks or savings institutions be considered as . dividends.\u201d But so far as it relates to savings banks, the only subject of the proviso is the annual or semi-annual interest allowed or paid to the depositors. It makes no reference to the undistributed surplus which may be carried to a surplus fund. That it leaves as it was in the body of the section, subject to the tax therein imposed. And to us it appears quite plain that such was the intention of Congress. Had it been the purpose to exempt savings banks from liability to pay the tax on both the interest paid to its depositors and on all undistributed sums carried to the surplus fund, the plain mode of expressing such a purpose was to say in the proviso that such banks should be excepted from the operation of the section. If such was the purpose, why except them expressly from the operation of a part of the section only ? Why take out one subject of taxation specifically, and leave the other unmentioned? And still more. If, as the plaintiff in error contends, it was intended that savings banks should pay no tax on either of the two subjects mentioned in the body of the section, why were such banks mentioned in the section at all? The broad construction of the proviso contended for makes it plainly repugnant to the body of the act, and it is, therefore, inadmissible. .\nOur attention has been called to the fact that in 1867, and again in 1870, the commissioners of internal revenue construed the proviso as exempting savings institutions from the tax upon all sums added to their surplus or contingent funds, and that the act of Congress of July 14th, 1870, which reduced internal taxation, employed substantially the same language respecting savings banks as that contained in the act of 1866. In view of this, the plaintiffs in error argue that Congress required the commissioner to prescribe what returns savings banks should make; that this made it his duty to put a construction on the law; that he did so, and held that such institutions were not required to return undistributed earnings carried to a surplus fund, and that after this practical construction bad been made and acted upon more than three years, Congress re-enacted the tax, reduced in amount, in the same words. Hence, it is inferred, the construction given by the commissioner was adopted. It is, doubtless, a rule that when a judicial construction has been given to a statute, the re-enactment of the statute is generally held to be in effect a legislative adoption of that construction. This, however, can only be when the statute is capable of the construction given to it, and when that construction has become a settled rule of conduct. The rule, we think, is inapplicable to this case. In the first place, the decisions of the internal revenue commissioner can hardly be denominated judicial constructions. That officer was not required by the law to prescribe what returns savings banks were required to make. That was prescribed by the act of Congress itself, and he had no power to dispense with the requisition. There is, therefore, no presumption that his decisions were brought to the knowledge of Congress when the act of 1870 was passed. And again, the construction he gave is an impossible one, for, as we have seen, it makes the proviso plainly repugnant to the body of the section.\n\"We are constrained, then, to hold that the act of Congress does impose upon the plaintiffs in error the tax to recover which the present suit was brought.\nThe second error assigned is that the Circuit Court erred in holding that an action of debt is maintainable in that court for the recovery of the taxes.\n\"We do not perceive that the question presented by this assignment was raised or even mentioned in the court below, and it is not clear that it may first be raised here. But if it may, the answer must be that the taxes ma}' be recovered in an action of debt brought in the Circuit Court.\nThe argument in support of the assignment of error is that the United States has no common law; that the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act enacts that the laws of the several States shall be the rules of decision in the trial of actions at common law, of which debt is one; that the act of Congress which imposes the tax on savings banks provides a special remedy for its assessment and collection, and that it is a principle of the common law of Pennsylvania, that when a statute creates a right and provides a particular remedy by which that right may be enforced, no other remedj' than that afforded by the statute can be used.\nIt must be conceded that in the section of the act,* which required savings banks to pay the tax, they are also required to render to the assessor or assistant assessor a list of the amount of taxes with a declaration under oath attached thereto, on or before the 10th day of the month following that in which any dividends or sums of money may be due and payable, and for any default in.rendering such a list they are liable to a penalt}'. The act also declares that \u201cin case of any default in making or rendering said list or return, or any default in the payment of the tax as required, or any part thereof, the assessment and collection of the tax and penalty shall be in accordance with the general provisions of law in other cases of neglect and refusal.\u201d \"What those general provisions are may be seen in other sections of the act which prescribe assessments, delivery thereof to the collectors, and distraint if necessary.\nIt must also be conceded to be a rule of the common law in England, as it is in Pennsylvania and many of the-other States, that where a statute creates a right and provides a particular remedy for its enforcement, the remedy is generally exclusive of all common-law remedies.\nBut it is important to notice upon what the rule is founded. ' The reason of the rule is that the statute, by providing a particular remedy, manifests an intention to prohibit other remedies, and the rule, therefore, rests upon a presumed statutory prohibition. It applies and it is enforced when any one to whom the statute is a rule of conduct seeks redress for a civil wrong. He is confined to the remedy pointed out in the statute, for he is forbidden to make use of any other. But by the Internal Revenue law, the United States are not prohibited from adopting any remedies for the recovery of a debt due to them which are known to the laws of Pennsylvania. The prohibitions, if any, either express or implied, contained in the enactment of 1866, are for others, not for the government. They may be obligatory upon tax collectors. They may prevent any suit at law by such officers or agents. But they are not rules for the conduct of the State. It is a familiar principle that the King is not bound by any act of Parliament unless he be named therein by special and particular words. The most general words that can be devised (for example, any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate) affect not him in the least, if they may tend to restrain or diminish any of his rights and interests. He may even take the benefit of any particular act, though not named. The rule thus settled respecting the British Crown is equally applicable to this government, and it has been applied frequently in the different States, and practically in the Federal courts. It may be considered as settled that so much of the royal prerogatives as belonged to the King in his capacity o\u00ed parens patriae, or universal trustee, enters as much into our political state as it does into the principles of the British constitution.\nIt must, then, be concluded that the government is not prohibited by anything contained in the act of 1866 from em ploying any common-law remedy for the collection of its dues. The reason of the rule which denies to others the use of any other than the statutory remedy is wanting, therefore, in applicability to the government, and the rule itself must not be extended, beyond its reason. And we do not find that either in England or in.Pennsylvania it has been held to be applicable. On the contrary, in England informations of debt, and exchequer informations for discovery and account, to recover duties on importations, have been of frequent occurrence, though the acts of Parliament have provided a different remedy for enforcing the payment. Numerous such cases are reported in Bunbury\u2019s Reports. And in United States v. Lyman, Judge Story held that debt might be maintained in the Circuit Court for Massachusetts to recover duties upon imported goods; a doctrine reasserted by this court in Meredith v. United States.\nBut all this is superfluous, for the act of Congress authorizes suits at law to recover unpaid taxes. It enacts as follows: \u201cAnd taxes may be sued for'and recovered, in the name of the United States, in any proper form of action, before any Circuit or District Court of the Uuited States for the district in. which the liability for such tax may have been or maybe incurred, or where the party from whom such tax is due may reside at the time of the commencement of said action.\u201d\nNor is there anything in the objection that the taxes for which judgment has been recovered in this case had not been assessed. No other assessment than that made by the statute was necessary to determine tlie extent of the bank\u2019s liability. An assessment is only determining the value of the thing taxed, and the amount of the tax required of each individual. It may be made by designated officers or by the law itself. In the present case the statute required every savings bank to pay a tax of five per cent, on all undistributed earnings made, or added during the year to their contingent funds. There was no occasion or room for any other assessment. This was a charge of a certain sum upon the bank, and without more it made the bank a debtor.\nWe think, therefore, the second assignment of error cannot he sustained. x\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n*\n14 Stat. at Large, 138.\n*\nAct of 1806, \u00a7 120.\n*\nMagdalen College Case, 11 Reports, 74; King v.

Reed et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/5464782\/","date":"1874-01-01","court":"Alabama Supreme Court","content":"PETERS, C. J.\nThis is an appeal by a guardian from a decree rendered against him on the final settlement of his accounts. He was regularly appointed, on the 29th November, 1858, as the \u201cguardian of Thomas S. Reed, Margaret A. Reed, James P. Reed, William D. Reed, Sarah E. Reed, and Susan A. Reed, minor heirs of James Reed,\u201d deceased. At a special term of the probate, court of De Kalb, in which said appointment had been made, William D. Reed, one of said heirs, filed his petition on the 27th November, 1869, praying that said Newman, the guardian, be notified \u201c to file his accounts and vouchers, and make a final settlement of his said guardianship.\u201d On this petition, there was an order of court granted, requiring \u201c said Moses C. Newman, guardian as aforesaid,\u201d after proper service of notice, \u201c to file his accounts and vouchers for a final settlement of his said guardianship.\u201d In obedience to this order, the guardian appeared, and filed his account, which is set out in the record, in these words : \u2014\n\u201cThe amended account-current of M. C. Newman, as guardian of James P. Reed, William D. Reed, Sarah E. Reed, and Susan A. Reed, children of Janies Reed, deceased, on final settlement.\n\u201c Dr.\n\u201c March 14, 1862, To amount collected and received of John S. Felton, attorney-at-law, Fayetteville, Tennessee, which amount was collected by said attorney from the executors of Nathan Reed, in Lincoln county, Tennessee, and sent to this guardian, viz., in C. S. currency . s . $1,314.50\n\u201c Or.\n\u201c August 18, 1862. By amount returned into court, viz., note on Sarah Reed, and W. D. Petty and Thos. Petty, security, for a portion of said currency loaned by guardian, dated 21st March, 1862, payable twelve months after date . . . 600.00\n\u201c March 21,1862. By amount C.

S. currency, less amount paid out by him, by virtue of his guardianship ........$1,314.50\u201d\nThis account was properly verified by affidavit, as required by law. The record then shows that this account was contested by \u201c W. D. Reed et al.\u201d; and they assigned in writing six grounds of objection to the several items of credit in the same, \u201c and asked that said credits be not allowed.\u201d Upon these objections an issue was made up, and the same was submitted to the court for trial. On the trial of this issue, the guardian offered himself as a witness, and testified as follows : \u201c That he, as such guardian, received the amount, as charged in his account, from the executors of Nathaniel Reed, through his agent, in C. S. currency; and that a small amount of the money collected may have been in Tennessee State bank-notes ; but he received, together with it, some for others who were alike interested, and he considered the amount charged as received for the contestants: and that on the day of , 1862, he resigned his trust, and filed his account for a final settlement ; and that on the day set for the settlement, as shown by the record, he, as such guardian, made what he supposed to be a final settlement, and returned into court the assets for which he now claims credits, as shown by his account; and that at the time he loaned the money referred to in his account, the sureties on the note were solvent, and that he considered the C, S. currency at that time at par value.\u201d\n\u201c This being all the evidence adduced in the cause, the court overruled or refused to sustain said account, and upon the testimony, as above set out, charged said guardian as shown in this decree.\u201d The decree, as copied in the record, states the names of the parties thus : \u201c W. D. Reed et al. v. Moses C. Newman, late guardian of the minor heirs of James Reed, deceased ; \u201d and is in these words : \u201c It is therefore ordered,\u201d &c., \u201c that the plaintiffs recover of and from the defendant the sum of two thousand one hundred and nineteen dollars; it appearing to the court, after all the evidence adduced in the cause, argument on both sides, an examination of the accounts and vouchers filed, and due and careful consideration thereof, that so much is due of debt, principal and interest thereon; for which execution may issue, together-with the costs of this proceeding.\u201d\nThe following errors are assigned on this decree: \u201c 1. The decree does not show who are the plaintiffs, or in whose favor it was rendered. 2. The decree, instead of being for plaintiffs, should have been for the defendant. 8. The decree does not allow the guardian any credit for moneys paid by him. 4. There was no proof of the value of Confederate States treasury-notes, or that they were of any value. 5. The decree is for too large an amount. 6. There is no evidence to sustain the decree.\u201d*\nThe objection to the description of the parties to the decree is not sufficient. The names of all the wards appear in the record. Any deficiency in this particular should have been objected to in the court below, where it could have been amended. If William D. Reed was the only party complaining, judgment should have been rendered in his name alone, for his share of the funds in the hands of the guardian. Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2811, 2422.\nThe powers and the duties of a guardian, appointed in this State, over the property of the ward, are very clearly pointed out by the Code. \u201c It is the duty of the guardian to manage the estate of his ward frugally, and to improve it to the best of his skill and ability. He must, if practicable, lend out all surplus money of the ward, on bond and mortgage, or on good personal security; and if the bond is not renewed annually, require the interest to be paid at the end of each year.\u201d Rev. Code, \u00a7 2426; Hall v. Hall, 43 Ala. 488. A guardian is a trustee, and the general principles regulating trusts apply to him. 2 Kent, 230-31, and notes. If a trustee acts with due diligence and fidelity in the discharge of a duty imposed upon him by law, and proceeds as the law directs, he is not to be held responsible if injury or loss thus accrues to the beneficiary. This is certainly the principle applicable to executors and administrators in this State. Gould v. Hays, 19 Ala. 438; Henderson v. Simmons, 33 Ala. 291; Ivey v. Coleman, 42 Ala. 409; Stewart\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Stewart\u2019s Heirs, 31 Ala. 207. This is also a proper rule to apply to guardians. 4 Bac. Abr. Bouv. p. 561.\nThe evidence in this case does not show that there was any negligence on the part of the guardian in collecting the promissory note on Mrs. Reed. It was given for funds of the wards, which the guardian had loaned her before his resignation; and it had not become due at the time of the resignation. It was loaned on solvent personal security. The guardian had authority to do this, and it had been done in a proper manner. Rev. Code, \u00a7 2426, supra. It did not appear that it had been lost by his neglect. The note was for the sum of six hundred dollars. It was dated March 21, 1862, and fell due in twelve months after date. It was a portion of the sum of $1314.50, which had been received from the executor of Nathan Reed, deceased, in the State of Tennessee. Upon the evidence set out in the record, this item of credit should have been allowed the guardian. The court below erred in refusing it.\nThe guardianship commenced in November, 1858. There were six wards. It is not pretended that the guardian received any property belonging to- them, before the sum of $1314.50 was received in March, 1862. There were, then, at least three years and near four months intervening between the commencement of the guardianship and the date at which any funds came into the hands of the guardian. It is highly probable that a claim for so small a sum as $40.00, for necessaries for the wards during these three years, was altogether reasonable. Had there been any evidence, or any sufficient voucher, to sustain this item, it ought to have been allowed. It was objected to for this reason by the contestants. The objection is in these words: \u201c 6. Because said guardian has filed no vouchers whatever for the credit side of said account, the plaintiffs ask that said credits be not allowed.\u201d This objection also applies to the credit asked for $19.68, \u201c cash expenses collecting C. S. Currency ; \u201d and for $6.75, \u201c taxes for year 1862; \u201d and for $1314.50, \u201c amount of worthless Confederate currency.\u201d There is no proof or vouchers to sustain these items. They were, therefore, properly refused as credits by the court on the trial below, though, upon sufficient proof, by voucher or otherwise, they were proper items of credit in such a case as this. The court did not err in refusing to allow them, for the reason that there were no vouchers or proof to sustain them.\nBut the item of credit for $65.72, \u201ccommissions for collecting and paying out,\u201d stands in a different attitude. This was compensation to the guardian, by way of commis sions on disbursements and receipts. Of this the court takes notice, without proof or vouchers, except as the record shows the amounts of the disbursements and the receipts. Upon final settlement, the guardian should be allowed the same compensation as executors and administrators. Rev. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2449, 2161, 2162. Some compensation should have been allowed. The court erred in refusing it altogether, on the evidence shown in the record.\nThere seems to be but one other question in this case, as presented by the present record, which needs to be discussed and settled, in order to enable the court below to proceed without embarrassment, on a new trial. This question arises out of the guardian\u2019s act in collecting the amount due his wards from the executor of the estate of Nathan Reed, deceased, in the State of Tennessee. The proof does not show how this sum of $1314.60 came to be converted into \u201c C. S. currency,\u201d or whether the act of conversion was occasioned by the guardian himself, or by some one else without any neglect of duty by the guardian. The guardian would only be liable, in the event the conversion was his own act, whether done by himself or his attorney, or that it had been brought about by his negligence. If he occasioned the conversion by himself, or by his attorney, or by any want of proper diligence in attending to the interests of his wards, he would be liable for any loss that they might thereby sustain. A guardian has no authority to change his ward\u2019s property into \u201cworthless C. S. currency,\u201d whatever that may be. Hall v. Hall, 43 Ala, 488; Lane & Wife v. Mickle, 46 Ala. 600; S. C. 43 Ala. 109.\nIf Nathan Reed died in the State of Tennessee, leaving an estate there in property or money, subject to distribution among his next of kin or legatees, or if he owed the wards a debt, then, if the wards of Newman, the appellant, occupied any of these relations towards said decedent, they would become entitled to this property or money on his death, by inheritance, or by his will, or as his creditors. Whatever this property might be, the wards would have a vested right in it as the owners. This property could not be taken away from them, and something else substituted in its stead, except by due course of law. Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610. If this property was money, or some other specific thing, then the heirs and distributees, or legatees or creditors, as the case might be, became invested with such right to it, whether money or other specific thing or debt, as the laws of the State of Tennessee, or the will of the deceased, bestowed upon them. This right of property being a vested right, it may be well doubted, whether the State could so invade it as to change this property into' \u201c Confederate States currency,\u201d which was worthless, or liable to become worthless, without the consent of the owners. Governments are not established by the people to impair or to destroy vested rights, but to protect them. Yatt. b. 1, ch. 4, s. 51; see also, 18 Wend. 56 ; 4 Conn. 225 ; 1 Bay, 252. And particularly those of the minors, orphans, and the widows of the State, to whom the government stands in the attitude of parens patriae, the highest and most sacred of all political relations. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 1327, 1328.\nAssuming that the expression \u201c C. S. currency,\u201d as used by the guardian in stating his account, means \u201c Confederate States treasury-notes,\u201d then it is clear that this currency was issued and put in circulation by an illegal and treasonable government,- to aid in the illegal and treasonable purposes of that government. It was simply a war currency, and had no value except for that purpose. It was the nerve of vitality in the right arm of the insurrection. These notes, it is said, \u201c As contracts in themselves, except in the contingency of a successful revolution,\u201d \u201cwere nullities;\u201d \u201cfor, except in that event, there would be no payer. They bore, indeed, this character (nullities ?) upon their face, for they were, made payable only \u201c after the ratification of a treaty of peace between the Confederate States and the United States of America.\u201d Chase, C. J., in Thorrington v. Smith, 8 Wall. 1, 11. It can hardly be denied that the purse and the sword, money and arms, are equally necessary to carry on war successfully. They belong to the war power of all governments not merely visionary. This is very clearly shown in the arguments on which the \u201clegal tender cases\u201d were determined. 12 Wall. 540, opinion of Strong, J. pp. 540, 541, et ubique; Tiffany on Government, pp. 244, 245, \u00a7\u00a7 427,428; lb. pp. 248, 249, \u00a7\u00a7 432, 433. For a like reason, of the -worthless and treasonable character of these notes, a similar currency issued by the State of Arkansas during the rebellion has been pronounced illegal and void by the supreme judicial tribunal of the nation. Hanauer v. Woodruff, 15 Wall. 439; see, also, Miller v. Lawson, 44 Ala. 616. Then, a conversion or transmutation of the property of the ward, into such a currency was an improper interference with their rights of property, and it is forbidden by the constitution of the State. Const. Ala. Art. I. \u00a7\u00a7 8, 25. Consequently, the sections of the Revised Code numbered 2134, 2135, so far as they attempt to legalize such a conversion, are unconstitutional and void. Rev. Code, \u00a7 2425.\nThe supposition that this spurious currency was issued to supply a want of the people for a circulating medium, is hardly supported by reason or fact. At the breaking out of the rebellion, all the seceding states were supplied with a bank and specie currency, sufficient for their wants. There was no com plaint of any deficiency in this respect. But, as soon as the war was inaugurated, its necessities demanded a vastly increased amount of circulation of some kind to meet the enormous requisitions of the military and civil service of the insurrection. To furnish this, the \u201c Confederate States currency \u201d was prepared and issued, not by the states, or under their authority, but by the war power of the insurgents; and it lived only with this power, and died with it. If it displaced the legitimate and legal currency of the insurrectionary states, it was because their population favored the rebellion, and gave this currency circulation for the same reason that it had been issued, to aid in carrying on the rebellion. It had none of the elements of a sound circulating medium about it. It was wholly spurious. It was not a legal tender in the payment of any legal debts, and it was not convertible into any other currency that was such legal tender. I cannot, therefore, believe that there is, or ever was, any power in the state government to sanction the conversion of the estates of the orphans and widows who inhabit it, and who have no political power to protect themselves, and their right to enjoy their property, hito such worthless and illegal currency. I do not think that the case of Thorrington v. Smith is intended to sanction such a proposition. 8 Wall, supra. If it does, the case of Hanauer v. Woodruff (15 Wall, supra) looks toa return to a so under doctrine. The guardian must show, upon a new trial, that the funds or property of his wards in the hands of the executor of Nathan Reed, deceased, were not converted into \u201c Confederate treasury-notes \u201d by his act, or the act of his attorney, or by any failure of duty on his part; or he must be charged with such funds or property after deducting all proper credits, as indicated above. The section of the Code above referred to cannot protect him. See Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cran. 87; Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, N. Y. 146. But it may be proper to add, that if the wards\u2019 property or funds were in the State of Tennessee, the guardian\u2019s power over them would be governed by the laws of Tennessee, until they were removed to this State. Story Confl. \u00a7\u00a7 504, 512, 513 et seq.\nThe judgment on a new trial, if for the wards, should be rendered in favor of each one separately, for his share, or for the share of each of those who ask to have a final settlement enforced. If, on the other hand, it is against the wards, then the judgment should be rendered in favor of the guardian, for costs, against those who joined in the proceedings in the court below. _ Rev.

SMITH, Respondent","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2325274\/","date":"1874-03-20","court":"Supreme Court of California","content":"McKINSTRY, J.\n\u2014 Respondent asked for a rehearing on the ground that the act of the legislature, which purports to authorize a sale of the property of the plaintiff \u2014 then a minor \u2014 and the proceedings under it, transferred his title in the demanded premises to the grantor of the defendant. It is highly probable that the jurisdiction of the chancellor over the persons and property of infants had its foundation in the prerogative of the crown, flowing from the general duty of the king \u2014 as parens patriae \u2014 to protect those who had no other lawful protector. The prerogative was exercised in the court of chancery, because it partook more of a judicial administration of rights and duties in foro conscientiae, than a strict executive authority: 2 Story\u2019s Equity, 1333, 1334. In the United States the appointment of guardians and their supervision seems always to have been regarded as a judicial power, and has generally been confided to judicial officers. Under our system in California the general law confers the jurisdiction on the probate courts.\n\u25a0Special laws providing for the sale by the guardian (of the person or property) of the real estate of the infant have been upheld by the courts of several of the states. But the legislative body under the charter in Rhode Island possessed judicial powers; and this is likewise true of the general court of Massachusetts, in the reports of whose courts many of the cases referred to are found. In subsequent cases to those in which the power of the legislature was recognized in New York, the whole doctrine has been doubted, if not disapproved; and elsewhere resort has been had to much ingenious refinement to escape the effect of a provision in the state constitution analogous to article 3 of our own. In most instances, also, the act provided that the guardian or trustee should be controlled, and his action directed and approved by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIt is true that the fourth section of the act now before us declares: \u201cThat no deed [made under the provisions of the act] shall be valid, or convey any title, unless the sale shall have been confirmed by the probate court previous to the execution of such deed of conveyance.\u201d But the person named in the act was not appointed guardian by any judicial authority in this state, and gave no bond to secure the due application of any fund which might come to her hands. The judge of probate was given power to disapprove of a sale, that is, to require that a larger sum should be realized and paid to the guardian, so called; but had no authority to interpose for the protection of the infant, by directing or supervising the use of the proceeds.\nIn California the precise question involved in this ease has never before been presented; and as the power is a judicial power, we feel constrained to. hold, upon the plain language of third article of the constitution, that it cannot be exercised by the legislative department of the government.\nJudgment and order denying new trial reversed and cause remanded.\n\u00a1We concur: Rhodes, J.; Crockett, J.; Niles, J."},{"case_name":"The People of the State of New York, Appellants, v. James H. Ingersoll, impleaded, etc., Respondent","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2158508\/","date":"1874-06-09","court":"New York Court of Appeals","content":"Allen, J.\nThe'historv of this action, a fragment only of which is presented by the record before us, has been peculiar, and if the practice adopted is to ripen into a precedent may be regarded as unfortunate. Ordinarily, a judgment deliberately given upon a question directly in issue has been;, and should be, regarded as the law of the particular case by other judges in subsequent stages of the litigation, until reversed upon appeal. In no other way can justice be duly administered, or the decisions of the courts command the respect of suitors and the public. Conflicting decisions by different judges, resulting in final judgments in the same action, each carried out to its legitimate results, necessarily leads to confusion; and indulged in to any great extent, will bring reproach upon the judicial system.\nThe principal question, and indeed the only question of importance that has, as yet, been presented to the courts, is as to the status of the plaintiffs and their right to maintain the action. That was first presented by the demurrer of the defendant first served with process, and the decision was for the plaintiffs,\" overruling the demurrer at Special Term, this was affirmed at General Term, the three justices sustaining their respective views in well considered and elaborate written opinions. This result was acquiesced in by that defendant who answered over, and the action stands for trial upon the issues of fact joined therein. Thereafter, upon the motion of the present defendant, about one-third of the complaint was, by order of another judge, stricken out as \u201c irrelevant and redundant,\u201d the allegations being claimed by the defendant, and held by the court, not essential either to the right of the plaintiffs, or the liability of the defendants, in respect to the cause of action stated. To the complaint, thus expurgated and pruned of what was regarded by the court below as superfluous and redundant statements, the present defendant demurred, and had judgment both at Special and General Terms, upon the ground that the plaintiffs had no standing in court, or right to maintain the action in respect to the matters and causes alleged. Thus two conflicting decisions have been given and are now operative, under one of which the plaintiffs, having a judgment affirming their right to maintain the action, the parties have put themselves upon the country; from the other, the present appeal has been taken. The precise question presented by this appeal may \u2014 if the matter stricken out by the court upon the application of the present defendant was, in fact, \u201cirrelevant and redundant,\u201d in noway affecting the cause of action or the status of the plaintiffs, in case of a recovery by the plaintiffs \u2014 be presented upon an appeal from the judgment upon the issues of fact now ready for trial; and thus, if the practice i\u00e1 tolerated, several successive appeals from judgments and decisions, in different forms, may be brought in the same action by different- parties, each presenting but the one and the same question. It is true, that the complaint has only been expurgated of the supposed redundant matter as to the present respondent, and as to the other defendants it stands as originally served; and the cause must proceed against them upon the facts alleged, so far as material to the right of the plaintiffs to sue, and upon the theory upon which the action was brought and the complaint framed by the learned counsel -for the plaintiffs, and this constitutes another of the anomalies of this case. Whether . the allegations and statements stricken out, as to this respondent, were or were not material, and might or might not be available to give the plaintiffs a right of action, is not before us upon this appeal; and no opinion is, therefore, expressed upon the question. It may be that if these allegations should be sustained by proof, the case would be regarded as so essentially different from that presented by the demurrer before us, that the judgment in the one case would not control in the other. All possibility of conflict or successive appeals on the same question would have been obviated had the part stricken out been regarded by the court as redundant, as it had been adjudged, and the decision of the court first made adopted as the law of the case, irrespective of the individual opinions of the judges. In its present form, a very doubtful question is involved as to the right of the plaintiffs to appeal, there being m> final judgment as to all the parties defendant. But in view of the magnitude of the amount, and the novelty and importance of the questions involved, and the serious embarrassments and possible loss that might arise from a dismissal of the appeal, I incline to forego the consideration of the question of practice, and consider the appeal upon its merits, as if no question existed as to its regularity. The action having been severed, as to this defendant, in the manner and -by the proceedings before referred to, the demurrer of the defendant and the present appeal must be considered as if the present respondent were the sole defendant, and the action stood against him alone.\nThe appeal in the action, as it comes before us, does not involve the right of the State to maintain an action against the auditors or any of them for malfeasance in office, or any person occupying an official position and who has been faithless to his trust. The action is for the recovery of a certain sum alleged to have been obtained by the respondent and the other persons named in the complaint, his associates and confederates, by false and fraudulent means and devices, and by a corrupt and fraudulent combination and conspiracy. The gist of the action is, the obtaining by the defendant and others and appropriating to their own use a large sum of money, to which they were not entitled, by the false and fraudulent practices detailed, and the demand is for judgment for the amount alleged to have been thus obtained, with interest. It is not in terms. averred that the money, in any legal sense or in equity and good conscience, belonged to the plaintiffs, so that the defendants can be charged with the same as received to their use, or that the wrong was perpetrated directly against the State or the people of. the State, that is, the whole State as a legal entity, and the whole body of the people; but the want of such averment it is claimed is supplied, and the necessity of such averment obviated, by allegations as to the source from which the money came, and the authority and agency by and purposes for which it was procured. The title to and ownership of the money sought to be recovered must determine the right of action, and if the money did not belong to the State, but did belong to some other body having capacity to sue, this action cannot be maintained. (People v. Booth, 32 N.Y., 397.) The eminent senior counsel for the plaintiffs, in his argument in the Supreme Court of the demurrer of another defendant, with copies of which we have been furnished, in answer to a question put as to \u201c who did own the money,\u201d asserted that the State owned it, and, in substance, conceded that none but the true owner could have an action for its recovery. He says: \u201c I believe I have answered the question, Who owns the money ? It is but another way of putting the question, Who can maintain the action? Of course, the. action ought to be maintained by the party who is regarded as the technical owner of the money, and the party so regarded in the law is the party to maintain the action P I have quoted this paragraph as expressing accurately and tersely the precise point upon which the right of the plaintiffs to sustain the action hinges, and it is in strict conformity with People v. Booth (supra). It may not be material whether the property in the money was absolute or qualified, general or special; but there must be an ownership of some kind to give an action. The party to -maintain an action for a tort or wrong to property must be one whose property rights have been tortiously interfered with or invaded \u2014 one who, as trustee, special property man, bailee or general owner, has been pecuniarily damaged. The State cannot, any more than an individual, have a civil action for the recovery of money, whether by way of damages for fraud or other wrong, the wrongful conversion of chattels, or for money received by and in the possession of others, except upon proof of title and ownership. A distinction is to be observed between actions by the people or the State, in right of the prerogative incident to sovereignty, and those founded on some pecuniary interest or proprietary right. The latter are governed by the ordinary rules of law by which rights are determined between individuals. A class of cases referred to and examined at great length by counsel do not call for an extended consideration if the title to the money fraudulently taken was in the county of New York, and an action lies at the suit of the board of supervisors in behalf of that county for its recovery. It is well settled in England that, in right of the prerogative of the crown, the attorney-general, in his name of office, may proceed, either by information or by bill in equity, to establish and enforce the execution of trusts of property by public corporations, to prevent the misappropriation or misapplication of funds or property raised or held for public use; and the abuse of power by the governors of corporations or public officers, or the exercise of powers not conferred by law, and, generally, to call upon the courts to see that right is done to the subjects of the crown who are incompetent to act for themselves. Ordinarily, the remedies sought have been preventive, but in some cases, as incident to the preventive and prospective relief, a claim has been made for retrospective relief, especially when the misappropriated funds could be traced and reclaimed in specie. The jurisdiction has been sustained upon the general principles of the right and duty of the court to grant preventive relief, and the relief actually granted, if any, in addition and as incident to that, has depended upon circumstances. The right of the attorney-general to intervene and the jurisdiction of the court was at first referred to the statute of Elizabeth concerning charitable uses and the trusts enforced as charities; later a public use, although not strictly charitable, was held within the equity of the statute; but a distinction was made as to the source from which the funds proceeded, and moneys, the avails of rates and taxes levied by act of parliament, were held not within the statute; but this distinction was soon ignored, and respect was had to the purpose for which property and funds were held, rather than their source and origin, in determining whether they were held for a public and charitable use within the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. Still more recently, courts have held that the statute of Elizabeth was not the source of the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, but that trustees of property for public use were always subject to the action of account, and that the Court of Chancery had concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of common law in compelling an accounting, and that by reason of the technicalities of the action of account proper in courts of law a court of equity afforded the better remedy of the two. The municipal corporation act of 6 William IY, chapter 76 has been referred to, but I do not understand that it affects the question as to the general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery over public trusts at the instance of the attorney-general. It did make large classes of property held by boroughs and other municipal corporations trust property, and the corporation trustees of the same, which before had been held as the property of the corporations, unaffected by any trust, and as private property, but in no other respect affected the jurisdiction of courts of equity. The same principle has been held applicable to commissioners and other public officers clothed by parliament with power over property for a public use. In all the cases the action of the court was invoked against faithless trustees, and to compel a proper execution of the trust, and a right use of trust funds by those charged with their administration. A breach of duty or a violation of trust by the trustees, either actual or threatened, and impending, is at the foundation of every action by the attorney-general or the crown, or the people as sovereign, and essential to the right of either to maintain, as well as to the right of a court of equity to entertain jurisdiction of a suit, by either touching property and funds held by public or municipal corporations for public use. If the property of a corporation be illegally interfered with by corporation officers and agents or others, the remedy is by action at the suit of tlm corporation, and not of the attorney-general. (Attorney-General v. Brown, 1 Swans., 265; Samev. Heelis, 2 S. & S., 67; Same v. Eastlake, 11 Hare, 205 ; Same v. Mayor of Dublin, 1 Bligh [N. P. R.], 312; Same v. Mayor of Liverpool, 1 M. & C., 171; Same v. Wilson, 1 Cr. & Ph., 1; Same v. Corporation of Poole, 2 Keene, 190; S. C., sub nom. Attorney-General v. Aspinall, id., 513, and 2 M. & C., 613; S. C., 4 M. & C., 417, and 8 Cl. & Fin., 409.) Decisions are cited from the reports of this country and of this State entitled to consideration and respect, affirming to some extent the doctrine of the English courts, and applying it to like cases, as they have arisen here. But in none has the doctrine been extended beyond the principles of the\u2019 English cases, and aside from the jurisdiction of courts of equity over trusts of - property for public uses, and over the trustees, either corporate or official, the courts have only interfered, at the instance of the attorney-general, to prevent and prohibit some official wrong by municipal corporations or public officers, and the exercise of usurped, or the abuse of actual powers. A case is not made by the complaint, within the doctrine contended for, or the cases relied upon, or within the reasons which lie at the foundation of the doctrine, and it is not necessary, therefore, to consider whether the doctrine to its full extent, or-within what limits, if at all, is a part of the common law of this State, or whether it has been superseded or modified by statute. Doubtless, the prerogatives of the crown, except as affected by constitutional limitations, exist in the people as sovereign, but to what extent the exercise of this prerogative is committed to the public officials, either by the legislature or by the common law, is. a question worthy of grave consideration, and not to be lightly decided, and should only be determined when necessary to a judgment and decision. Whenever the legislature, by statutory enactment, has conferred upon State officers or public bodies authority to represent the body of the people in the exercise of any prerogative right no question can arise, for in those matters, except as restrained by the Constitution, the legislature is supreme. If there were no other remedy for a great wrong, and public justice and individual rights were likely to suffer 'for want of a prosecutor capable of pursuing the wrong-doer and redressing the wrong, the courts would struggle hard to find authority for the attorney-general to intervene in the name of the people. But, in the absence of such a necessity, the exercise of high prerogative powers ought not, by a species of judicial legislation, to be committed to the discretion of any individual or body of p\u00eden. Such a committal of power should be the act of the legislature, who can hedge it about with all necessary safeguards. This action is not to establish or enforce a trust. The parties defendant are not, nor is either of them a trustee charged with any duty, or intrusted with the possession of funds- or property to be administered by them for any public use. They are sought to be charged as tort feasors, for a consummated and completed tortious act.\nThe present respondent is not alleged to have occupied any official position, or to have owed any allegiance to the State or any of its civil or political divisions, except such as every citizen owes, and is not charged with having occupied any fiduciary relation to the city, county or State' of Hew York, or to the funds of either. Unless the people of the State, or the State as a body politic or corporate, owned and were entitled to the money wrongfully abstracted, the defendant cannot be made a trustee for the State by reason of his tortious act; that is, he can only be charged as an involuntary trustee of the true owner of the fund. Only one of the other defendants had any official relation to the \u25a0 transaction detailed, and such relation was not that of trustee in any sense of any funds or property, or of the credit of the public. He, with others, was charged with certain specific duties, which did not include the possession, care or disposal of the public funds or credit. These duties were' concluded long before the commencement of this action, and the complaint against him, so far as it touches his official action, is for malversation in the administration of his office or agency, by means of which large sums of money have been lost to the true owner, and appropriated by himself and others. Whatever other remedies the people may have to redress or punish this wrong, no precedent has been referred to for the maintenance of a civil action by the people to recover either the money lost or for compensatory damages, without proof of a right .in the State as a political and corporate entity to the money as owner, and which would give it a place in the treasury of the State when recovered, or for some pecuniary damages sustained by the State, the compensation for which would of right belong to its treasury. The people, by the complaint, claim as owners,, and do not seek to reclaim the money and compel its appropriation to any particular use or purpose. The claim of counsel, in their printed brief and upon argument, was, that it must be assumed that upon the recovery of the money by the State, and its reaching the State treasury the legislature would make such disposition of it as should be equitable and just, not claiming that there was any valid trust which could be established and enforced in equity. Such a shadowy and unsubstantial equity, depending upon the will and future action of the legislature for its recognition and establishment,. is not the equivalent of\u00a1 or substitute for, a trust of which the courts can take cognizance. In all the cases' of public or charitable use, established at the suit of the attorney-general or the State, the particular use has been averred, and without such averments the bill or information would have shown no equity, and the court would have been without jurisdiction. Attorney-General v. Huber, Same v. Eastlake, Same v. Brown (supra), are illustrations of the principles controlling the jurisdiction of courts of equity over individuals and public bodies acting officially in respect to property interests of the public. In 'all the cases the parties proceeded against, and whose action was sought to be controlled or restrained, had the active administration of property or the power to raise and control funds dedicated or granted for public use, and their offices and duties were continuing, and respect was had in the relief sought to their future action. So the other cases referred to supra, of Attorney-General v. Dublin and Same v. Liverpool, are instances of the application of the principle, and the exercise of the jurisdiction against municipalities having control and direction of funds and property for the public use. The Attorney-General v. Wilson (Craig & Phil.), differs from the others in this: that the borough of Leeds appeared on the record as relator and as a co-plaintiff with the attorney-general. The right of the corporation of Leeds to maintain the action was recognized and affirmed by the court; and it was- said that the right of action, prior to the passage of the municipal corporation act of 6 William IV, was solely in that corporation, for the reason that the fund was the property of the corporation, and was only subjected to a trust and the jurisdiction of the court of equity as a trust fund by that act; and it was held that the corporation was a proper party to the action, its right of action not being destroyed, because, by the act, the attorney-general had a right to complain of a violation of the trust. In that case, as in the others, the foundation of the jurisdiction was an existing and continuing trust, and the object and purpose of the action was to compel the due execution of the trust, and for relief against a fraudulent misappropriation of the trust fund by former governors of the corporation and managers of the trust. But without further pursuing, in this connection, the consideration of the rights- of the people of the State, and the powers of the attorney-general as their representative, to call the parties to an account for their malfeasances, and to reclaim the money tortiously and fraudulently appropriated, the right of the county of Hew York to sue for and recover the money as. owner and proprietor should be considered as the question primarily to be determined, for in the absence of any fraud or collusion on the part of the governing body of the county in the perpetration of the wrong and commission of the fraud, or any inability or disinclination of the proper officers of the county to prosecute, if the money was the property of the county, property belonging to its treasury, and the robbery and wrong was against the county, whether the money was held upon any particular trust, or was applicable to the general purposes of the county, or was incapable of use for county purposes, except by legislative permission, there would he no necessity or occasion for the intervention of the people or their attorney-general, as there might he if the authorities of the county \u2014 the trustees in fact \u2014 had been participants in the fraudulent abstraction of the moneys, or accessories to the frauds by refusing to prosecute. It is material to recall the fact that all the allegations of collusion, on the part' of the county officers, in the perpetration of the fraud and wrong, and in the illusory prosecution of the offenders, as well as of any unwillingness on the part of the county or its corporate authorities to prosecute for the recovery, have been expunged from the complaint, as to this defendant. It would not be claimed that if the county has a cause of action and can- recover the money (and there are no obstacles to an action by the' county) and no omission of the officers of the county to bring an action) that' the State can maintain an action for the same money. True, in some cases, as in the case of general owner and bailee, or principal and agent, either can, under certain circumstances, maintain an action for money or property or upon contracts; but these are exceptional cases, and this case is not within the exception or the reasons for it. There is no such or analogous relation between the State government and the counties of the State, and the general rule must apply, that a right of action for the same thing cannot, in the absence of legislation or some peculiar reason giving duplicate actions, exist at the same time in two independent corporations or individuals. For the wrongful conversion of money or property belonging to a municipal corporation, or for which it may have an action, there cannot be concurrent remedies by the State and the municipality prosecuted pari passu. If the State has a right of action it results from and as an incident of its sovereignty, and must, necessarily, be paramount to that of the subordinate body, and upon the exercise of the right by the State the right of the corporation must be suspended, and upon a recovery by the State the corporation be barred of its remedy. Otherwise, a party may be vexed with two litigations, and possibly have two recoveries against him for the same cause of action. I find no authority or precedent for thus depriving a municipal corporation of a civil and corporate right of action, and of property, in the discretion of the law officer of the State. A county is not independent of the State, an imperium, in imperio, but is in all things subject to the State and the legislature of the State, as sovereign, and its boundaries, its rights, privileges and powers may be enlarged or curtailed, and its property and property rights controlled from time to time, in the discretion of the legislature; but when grants, whether of rights or of power, are conferred by the legislature they are held absolutely, and to be enjoyed and exercised independently, subject only to the general laws of the State, the terms and conditions annexed to the grant, until withdrawn or modified by the legislature. This is consistent with The Town of Guilford v. Supervisors of Chenango (3 Kern., 143), and Darlington v. Mayor of New York (31 N. Y., 164). Chancellor Kent, in speaking of municipal corporations, says: \u201c They may be empowered to take or hold private property for municipal uses, and such property is invested with the security of other private rights.\u201d (2 Kent\u2019s Com., 275.) As remarked by Judge Denio, in Darlington v. Mayor, etc. (supra): \u201c This does not exempt such property from legislative control, and, in that respect, property rights stand upon the same footing as other corporate rights, whether political or civil. Property owned by a city, county or other municipal or local government, is held by it as a public corporation and subject to the law-making power, and the governing body, by whatever name' called and known, are merely trustees for the public, who are the cestui que trust of the corporation. A municipal corporation is the trustee of the inhabitants of the territory embraced within its limits.\u201d\nAn effort has been made to distinguish the county of New York from the other counties of the State, in respect to its powers and corporate capacity, as one of the civil and political divisions of the State. But a brief consideration will serve to show, as was impliedly, if not expressly, conceded by counsel for the plaintiffs, that there is no substantial distinction: that is, no difference, between the organization and power of the county of New York and those of the other counties of the State which in the least affects the question under consideration. From the first, the State has been divided, for governmental and political purposes, into counties, and every part of the State'has been incorporated into and embraced within the territorial limits of some county, and subjected to county government. Every Constitution of this State has recognized this fact, and made provisions consistent with it and based upon it. New York was one of the twelve original counties into which the State was divided by a law of the first legislature, held in the then colony of New York, on the 1st day of November, 1683. (2 R. L., 44, 45, 46.) The first charter of the city of New York granted after the treaty of peace of 1674, by which the English were reinstated in the possession of the colony, was by Governor Dongan, in 1683, although the charter of Governor Nicolls, of 1664, had been recognized, and corporate proceedings had under it from 1674 to the granting of the Dongan charter. (Hoffman\u2019s Treatise, 20.) From an early period, if not from the first, the boundaries of the city and county of New York have been the same. Perhaps at one period this was not so, but the fact is not material, and only of interest as a matter of local history. (See Hoffman\u2019s Treatises on the Corporation, appendix, xix, xx, xxi, notes 17, 18.)\nFrom 1683 to the present time the county of New York has existed with substantially the same territorial limits as at present, at all times having and exercising more or less of the political and corporate rights that were held and exercised by the other counties of the State. By reason of the coincidence of the boundaries and the constituencies of the two distinct organizations, the city and county of New York, and their common interests and sources of revenues, the county organization has been of less political importance than in other sections of the State, and the governing body has been differently constituted and has exercised less power. At times, many of the powers exercised elsewhere by the boards of supervisors have been devolved upon the common council of the city; and, duties ordinarily performed by county officers have been performed by city officials. It is not important to trace the changes that have been made from time to time, by some of which the distinction between the city and county government has been, to some extent, ignored. At no time has the county ceased to exist, and at all times a body has existed known as the board of supervis\u00f3las of the county, who were the governing body of the county, exercising such-legislative, administrative and corporate powers as the legislature has seen fit to intrust to it. To the extent that other special provision has been made by law for the performance of the functions in other counties performed by the boards of supervisors, the county of New York has been excepted from and not subject to the general laws affecting counties and prescribing the powers and duties of boards of supervisors. But in all other respects, the county has been subject to such general laws, and possessed all the powers corporate, as well as governmental, conferred by law upon the counties of the State. In 1857 a most material change was effected in the constitution of the county government, and from that time the functions of the governing body and the corporate powers of the county have been greatly enlarged, and the county government has more nearly assimilated to that of other counties. In that year, the controlling power in both branches of the legislature and the executive department of the State was in antagonism with the party dominant in the city and county of New York, and -either with a view to the better administration of the government of the county, or for the purpose of dividing the political power and the emoluments of office in the city and county of New York, provision was made for the government of the county by a hybrid body: that is, by a board of supervisors so chosen as to secure an equal number from each of the two political parties. As a reform in government the project was doubtless a failure; but as a means by which individual members of the two parties were enabled to combine and enjoy the luxuries of power, patronage and plunder, it has proved a perfect success.\nIt is probably true, that up to that time the county, as such, had but little, if any property, even that which was necessary for public use, but that circumstance did not affect its political existence or corporate capacity. A county may be absolutely destitute of all property and pecuniary means, and yet the political and corporate existence be as perfect and the corporate rights as complete as under any other circumstances. Yery few of the counties possess any property, save the necessary lands and buildings for public use, and some, at an early day, may not have been the possessors of these, but their records may have been kept in the dwelling, store or office of the clerk charged with their custody, their courts held in a school-house, occupied by the sufferance and permission of the school trustees. But the county organization was none the less perfect by reason of the poverty of the county, or its imperfect preparation to perform all its functions. It suffices, for all the purposes of the present argument, that from 1857 to the passage of the law of 1870 the county, under the administration of a board of supervisors, did exercise many and large political, legislative and administrative powers,\" acquire property, incur pecuniary liabilities and perform other corporate acts under the sanction of law. The board of supervisors of the county of New York were not, certainly, during all that time distinguished from the boards of supervisors of other counties by the want of power or the opportunities for its exercise, although the powers were not in all respects identical. The legislation which is the occasion of the present litigation recognizes and affirms the corporate existence and capacity of the county of New York as distinct from and independent of the city government, and as possessing all the essential powers conferred upon other counties ; and if there were no other foundation for the claim, that legislation would be sufficient to invest the county with all the attributes which jiertam to a county organization and a municipal corporation, and bring New York within the provisions of the general statutes upon the subject of counties and their corporate rights and powers, except as otherwise specially provided by law.\nThe act (chap. 382 of the Laws of 1870), \u201c to make further provisions for the government of the county of New York,\u201d distinctly recognizes the existence of a county, with every element of power and circumstance that can be claimed as necessarily incident to any other like organization. It directs the board of supervisors to cause to be raised by tax the sums of money necessary for the payment of the claims specified in certain sections thereof, after deducting from the aggregate amount of the claims the estimated revenues of the county; thus recognizing the existence of liabilities against the county, and the possession by it of property and sources of revenue other than the power of levying taxes. It also regulates the bringing of actions against the county, and section 4 is based upon the acknowledged fact that the county had incurred obligations and contracted debts, which were \u00e1 county charge, to an amount so large that it was inexpedient to levy a tax for the payment of them at that time, and, hence, provision was made for borrowing money for that purpose. By the special provisions made for the audit aud payment of the claims, referred to, the legal right and obligations of the county were not essentially varied, or the relation between the State and county affected, or any new relation created between the State and the creditors of the county. A special process was devised and put in execution to meet a present necessity, somewhat different in detail from that provided by general laws for the adjustment and payment of county charges, but the whole process was by and in behalf of the county as a corporate body, having the .power to act for itself, and there was no special or general agency to act in behalf of the State. It was merely a grant of corporate power, modified and varied from that ordinarily conferred upon this and other counties, as made necessary by the peculiar circumstances ; and to the limit of the power thus conferred the county was an independent individual agent, and the State, as such, was neither entitled to the fruits nor responsible for the consequences of the exercise of such power. The county was permitted to change the form of its indebtedness, but the indebtedness remained, as before, a county charge. The authority to borrow was conferred upon the county, and to be executed by county officers.\nThe special duty of auditing the claims was imposed upon the individuals designated by the act, but their duty ended Avith certifying the amounts of the several claims, and the county officials had no control of their action. The legislature might have fixed the sums and adjusted the claims in the statute, or authorized the amount to be determined in any other way, or by any other tribunal. To this extent, the county, in respect to this class of claims, was taken out of the general statutory provisions authorizing claims and charges against counties to be audited by the board of supervisors. (1 R. S., 366, \u00a7 4; id., 368, \u00a7 17.) Those individuals were not strictly county officers, neither were they State officers, but constituted a special commission for performing a service for and binding upon the county which is ordinarily performed by a county board, and which would seem 16 have been before then performed by the comptroller of the city, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 854 of the Laws of 1868. Precedent was found for a special board of audit for the adjustment of claims against the county of Hew York in chapter 806 of the Laws of 1867, constituting Ghauncey M. Depew, Benjamin W. Bonney, Lewis B. Woodruff and John H. Martindale such board. Every other act, save the audit of the claims, was to be performed, and was performed, by the county officials and in behalf of the county. The money was to be and was borrowed upon the bonds of the county, executed and attested by the proper officers, and paid by- the comptroller to the proper claimants. The chamberlain of the city is by law made county treasurer, and all moneys belonging to the county, from whatever source derived, of right are received by him and disbursed upon proper warrants. (1 R. S., 370, \u00a7 29.)\nBy the act substituting the non-partisan board of supervisors for the former organization (Laws of 1857, chap. 590, \u00a7 6), the finance department of the city and its officers (of whom the comptroller is chief), are to have the like powers and perform the like duties in regard to the fiscal concerns of the board of supervisors, as in regard to the local concerns of the city ; and it is directed that no money shall be drawn from the treasury of the county except on the warrant of the comptroller, countersigned by the mayor and clerk of the board, thus making the comptroller and mayor ex officio county officers. The complaint, therefore, is strictly accurate in the averment that the moneys obtained from Iona fide purchasers of the bonds, issued by the comptroller as prescribed by the act, were \u201c in formal compliance with the statutes and usual modes of official proceeding in said city, deposited in the Yational Broadway Bank of the city of Yew York, to the credit of an account therein kept by the chamberlain of the city of Yew York, as county treasurer of the said county, by virtue of his said official character as such chamberlain.\u201d The comptroller was not a depositary or disbnrser of the public funds, and the act did not contemplate that he should receive and disburse the money. The brief direction in the act, that he should pay the claims audited, must be read in connection with the general laws defining his powers and prescribing his duties in respect to county matters, and as a county officer, or an officer charged with duties affecting the county. It was merely an authority, and a direction to draw a warrant upon the county treasurer in the usual form, as was done in this case. It was not intended to take these funds without the protection of the safeguards provided by law for all public funds. Thus the funds were, as averred in the cqnqDlaint, legally and properly paid into the county treasury as county moneys, to be drawn out only in the manner and upon the warrants authorized bylaw. In the withdrawal of these funds all the forms of law were complied with. The relation of the county of New York to these moneys, and its right as a municipal corporation to and over them, was precisely the same as would have been that of any and every other county in the State to moneys raised upon its credit, or in virtue of power conferred upon it for county purposes. The question then is as to the rights of a county, as a public corporation, in respect to funds raised by authority of law upon its credit, and in the hands of its treasurer,' and whether an action could be maintained by the county in any form for the recovery of the money, if tortiously or fraudulently taken from the county depositary or embezzled by him.\nCorporate capacity is conferred upon each county in the State, and New York is not excepted, to sue and be sued, to purchase and hold lands within its limits, for the use of its inhabitants; to make contracts and j>assess personal property, and to dispose of and regulate the use of its corporate property; and all suits and proceedings by and against a county in its corporate capacity are directed to be in the name of the board of supervisors of such county, that serving pro hac vice, as the corporate name. (1 R. S., 364, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; id., 384, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 2 id., 473, \u00a7\u00a7 92, 95; Supervisors of Onondaga v. Morgan, 2 Keyes, 277.) Counties are public, as distinguished from private corporations, and they are political as auxiliaries to the government of the State, and they are trustees of the people, the inhabitants within their county. (North Hempstead v. Hempstead, 2 Wend., 109.) They are sometimes called quasi corporations, because not in terms declared by statute to be corporations, and have a corporate capacity only for particular specified ends. But so long as they are invested with corporate attributes, even if it be sub modo, the distinction is without a substantial difference within the limits of the corporate powers conferred. (2 Kent\u2019s Com., 278, 279; A. & A. on Corporations, \u00a7 23.) They are trustees only of the property held for public use. They are not the guardians and protectors of private and individual interest or property of the citizen. They may not intervene by action to protect or redress the individual citizen in respect to wrongs or injury to his person or property. Their power as well as duty is restricted to the protection and preservation of property possessed by them in their corporate capacity. (Town of Guilford v. Supervisors of Chenango; Mayor of Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Company, 12 Peters, 91.) This trusteeship and corporate power, as a pecuniary and fiduciary relation, extends to and embraces not only the tangible property of the corporation, but the franchises and powers conferred for raising moneys and other means for the support of the local government and the use of the inhabitants of the county, and to the means realized from the franchises and powers conferred. It is immaterial whether the grant be of fees and emoluments from licenses, excise duties, rents or the like, or of a power to levy taxes or borrow money. The grant is a money grant by the State to the extent of the power conferred and the money realized under and by means of it. The pecuniary ability of a county may consist entirely, as it does ordinarily, in the power delegated to it to levy taxes or create a debt. The credit of the county, with granted power to use it, supported by the power of taxation delegated by the State, is a corporate right, and the fruits and avails of that credit, when exercised by the borrowing of money, are as much the property and rightfully belong to the treasury of the county as if the specific sum had been granted in terms and paid from any other source. In political and governmental matters the municipalities are the representatives of the sovereignty of the State, and auxiliary to it; in other matters, relating to property rights and pecuniary obligations, they have the attributes and the distinctive legal rights of private corporations, and may acquire property, create debts, and sue and be sued as other corporations; and in the borrowing of money and incurring pecuniary obligations in any form, as well as in the buying and selling of property within the limits of the corporate powers conferred, they neither represent nor bind the State.\nThe relation of principal and agent does not and cannot exist, for obvious reasons, between the State and the various municipal corporations, created with power to contract debts in respect to the exercise of the corporate functions. Debts contracted by municipalities, by authority of the legislature, are contracted by them as principals and not as agents of the State. If this were not so, they would be clearly within the prohibition of section 12 of article 1 of the Constitution, but that they are not was decided in People v. Flagg (46 N. Y., 401). This agency must be established to entitle the State, without the direct sanction of the legislature, to claim or control the fruits and proceeds of the legal pledge of municipal credit, and from such agency, once established, necessarily and logically results the liability of the State for the debts incurred, and this in face of the explicit prohibition in the State Constitution against the direct and indirect creation of a State debt. The State cannot claim the benefits and repudiate the obligations resulting from the relation of principal and agent. The claim of the State to funds and moneys thus acquired cannot be rested upon the general sovereignty of the State and its rights and duties as parens patriae. The State may, and must in some eases, care for and protect those who are incapable of caring for themselves, as infants, idiots and the like; but a corporation with full power to acquire and hold property, create debts, levy taxes and sue and \u25a0 be sued, with a competent board of governors, is not within this class of incompetents in need of the exercise of this nursing quality of the State government. Neither can I discern any just foundation for the claim of the State to these funds \u2014 that its action is necessary to the protection of the tax-payers of the municipality. The cestuis que trust of the corporate property consist of all the inhabitants within the territorial limits of the corporation, including tax-payers and non-taxpayers ; they are the corporators and their interests, as well the present as future inhabitants and corporators, are cared for and represented by the governing body for the time being as in other corporations. I incline to the opinion that money borrowed or raised by taxation for county purposes,\u2018and not wanted or used for the particular purposes for which it was raised, is applicable, by the action of the board of supervisors, to the payment of any county charge; but if this be not so, the want of power to appropriate it to public use, without legislative authority, does not work a forfeiture of the money to the State. It is not intended to deny the existence of plenary power in the legislature to direct the appropriation of any money in the county treasury to any use or purpose for the benefit of the inhabitants of the municipality. (Darlington v. The Mayor, supra.) The same objection might be taken to the right of the State, for if the moneys were once in the State treasury, it would require legislation to authorize their application or payment to any particular use. But whatever the legislature might do in the way of revoking a grant of power or of using or controlling the property of a county, no power in that direction has been conferred upon the attorney-general.\nMuch was said in the course of the argument of the position and rights of the tax-payers, and the impossibility of justice being done them, unless the State could by action recover and control the money in controversy. But the tax-payers, as distinguished from other inhabitants of the county, have no peculiar interests to subserve, or right to or interest in the money. The cestuis que trust of a municipal corporation are all the inhabitants within the territorial limits, whether taxable or not; and although the tax-payer may be more immediately affected pecuniarily by a maladministration of the corporate and trust funds, he has no rights except such as are common to all the inhabitants. One tax-payer for himself, or himself and all others, or all the tax-payers combined, cannot have an action for the correction or prevention of a misappro priation or misuser of the corporate property. (Doolittle v. Supervisors of Broome County, 18 N. Y., 155; Roosevelt v. Draper, 23 id, 318.) When the State, in the exercise of the taxing power, or any of the political corporations in the exercise of a delegation of the same power, has collected taxes pursuant to law, the amount levied has ceased to be the property of the tax-payers, and becomes corporate funds and money in trust for public purposes. The result is the same if the money is borrowed in anticipation of taxation and to be levied of those who shall hereafter become tax-payers. Neither the present nor prospective tax-payers have any special and peculiar interest in the fund, as distinguished from that of other citizens and subjects of the government, imposing the tax or incurring the debt. The borrowing of money to be repaid by taxation in the future is but one form of exercising the taxing power, and the character of the fund is the same, whether it has been collected of the tax-payer or borrowed upon the credit of the government, State or local. (People v. Flagg, 46 N. Y., 401.) For all governmental and public purposes, including that of levying taxes and borrowing money for public use, the corporation is regarded as perpetual, and no respect is had to the changing character of the constituency, and those liable to contribute to the support of the government or the payment of its debts-. If, by mistake or error of any kind, taxes in excess of the ' amount required for present purposes have been,-pursuant to law, collected they cannot be recovered back, unless there has been some irregularity or defect of jurisdiction, which vitiates the assessment and levy.\nNeither is the money a waif belonging to the State,\u201d or any one who may chance to obtain possession of it, but it belongs to the municipal treasury, and is a trust fund for public use by the corporate authority. The result is the same if the money has been borrowed in excess of actual wants, and it is enough that a binding obligation has been incurred by the municipality to repay the money. Whether the obligation was incurred strictly pursuant to law is not important. If the public corporation, having power to act in a corporate capacity, has, by its officers, so acted under the laws as to become bound by its obligation, the debt has become a corporate and a county charge, and the moneys, the fruits and proceeds of the obligation, are trust funds subject to the control of the governing body of the corporation under the general laws of the State. The validity of the bonds, whicli are represented by the moneys sought to be recovered in this action, is conceded by the counsel for the appellants, and if not valid the purchasers of the bonds are entitled to reclaim the money paid for them. If valid, they are the obligations of the county of Hew York, and the debt a county charge. The State is under no obligation to pay the bonds or to provide for their payment, except so far as a sovereign State is bound to act in good faith toward those who have acted and parted with their money on the faith of its laws and policy. The State cannot, in good morals, do anything to impair or diminish the ability of the county to pay the bonds at maturity. The only security the debtor has is the credit of the county, and the grant of power to the county with direction in the act to levy taxes for the payment of the debt. To this extent, the State may, perhaps, be regarded as contracting with those who have taken the bonds, and to have agreed that this grant of power shall not be revoked; but this does not create an obligation to pay the bonds. It only brings the transaction within the provision of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting States from passing any bill \u201c impairing the obligations of contracts \u201d (Constitution of the United States, art. 1, \u00a7 10), and makes the grant of power irrevocable. (Hoffman v. Quincy, 4 Wallace, 535.) It is claimed that the county cannot be sued upon these bonds and a recovery had. That the federal courts would sustain an action upon these bonds against the county can hardly be doubted, in view of the past action of those courts in similar actions. It has been held by the courts of this State, that for claims which by statute are made a county charge, and for the auditing of which provision is made by statute, counties can not be sued. (Brady v. Supervisors of New York, 10 N. Y., 260; Martin v. Supervisors of Greene County, 29 id., 645.) Conceding that the rule holds as to an absolute undertaking to pay a specified sum at a given day, it proves nothing, If ,n action will not lie upon the bonds against the county, the holders have a perfect legal remedy by the writ of mandamus to compel the levy of the tax and the payment of the bonds, and whether the debt may be recovered by one form of civil procedure or another is not material. It necessarily follows, that this money being the fruits and avails of a burden, imposed pursuant to law upon the taxable inhabitants and property of the county of Hew York, for county purposes, of right belonged to the county of Hew York and its treasury, and the county has an action against any one who has by fraud or force become possessed of it.\nIt would hardly be claimed that if, after the avails of the bonds had been deposited with the county treasurer, the alleged frauds in the audit had been discovered and the warrants withheld, or payment had been refused by the treasurer, the State, by its attorney-general, without legislation, could have compelled the payment of the moneys into the State treasury, or recovered the money of the county treasurer. Heither would it be claimed that had the county treasurer embezzled the funds his sureties would not have been liable as for county moneys received by him. Had the bonds been delivered to a purchaser without actual payment of the money, any proceedings' for a recovery of the bonds or the purchase-price would, necessarily, have been by the county. The fact that a larger sum was borrowed than was required to pay the just elalms against the county, by reason of a fraud in the audit, does not, in my judgment, affect the question. The money has been raised, properly or improperly, upon the credit and at the expense of the county and for its use, to be repaid by it. The wrongful act of the public agents does not give to the State the rights and impose upon it the obligations of a principal in the transaction. Had only just claims been audited and all owed,,and the precise amount required for their pay ment been raised, and that had been taken by force or fraud, from the possession of the county treasury, the legal rights of the county and the relation of the State to the transaction would have been precisely the same as now, and yet the right of the county to maintain an action for the money would not in the case supposed, have been doubted. The county would have been the rightful possessor of the money and the propwr party to an action, for its recovery. ( Van Keuren v. Johnston, 3 Denio, 183; Supervisors of Albany County v. Durant, 9 Paige, 182.) The reversal of the decree in this case by the Court for the Correction of Errors (26 Wend., 66) was upon a ground not affecting the right of a board of supervisors to maintain the action, if a cause of action had existed.\nIf any county of the State should, by authority of law, levy by tax or borrow upon the credit of the county and a pledge of taxes to be levied in the future, a sum of money' for the building of a court-house or other special purpose, no one would doubt the title of the county to the money so long as it remained unexpended in the hands of the county officials, or its right of action for the recovery of it, if it should be tortiously taken or embezzled. If there should be a surplus remaining of the same money after the accomplishment of the special purpose for which it was raised, and it should be fraudulently or tortiously appropriated, the property of the county in such surplus, and its right of action to reclaim it, to the exclusion of the State and every other corporate body, would not be questioned. This case does not differ in principle and cannot be distinguished from that supposed. But' for the importance given to it by eminent counsel, I should not regard the source from which the money came as a controlling, or even an important element in determining by whom the action should be brought. It was in the county treasury, and was paid from the treasury as alleged, and received by the defendant as the money of the county, upon a claim against the county; and if such claim was fraudulent and the pretence, under which the money was obtained false, the defendant is necessarily liable to the county, either in an action for the fraud or for money had and received, and is estopped from denying the title of the county to the money, or its right to reclaim it, if in fact it was falsely and fraudulently obtained. These considerations lead to an affirmance of tile judgment of the Supreme Court.\nWhile in view of some of the circumstances connected with the origin and history of this suit we might wish, for the purposes of this action, the law was different, we can but declare it as we find it. There is nothing in the transaction itself, or facts alleged in the complaint, to distinguish this case, in principle, from any other in which the funds and property of a county have been embezzled, stolen or tortiously appropriated, or tending to show that the right of action and remedy which would exist in such ease in any county of the State, are not vested in or do not belong to the county of New York, in respect to the wrong complained of here. Neither is it averred in the complaint that obstacles, in any form, exist to the prosecution of such remedy by the county, or that the corporate authorities have not prosecuted, or will not and cannot effectually prosecute for the, alleged wrong.\nWere it believed that the remedy by and in behalf of the county was not plain, palpable and free from all doubt, we might hesitate in giving the judgment to which our examination has led us, lest a flagrant wrong might go unpunished. It was conceded by counsel for the plaintiffs, upon the first argument of this appeal, that the same reasons do not now exist for maintaining an action by the State, rather than the county, that were supposed to exist at the time of the commencement of this action. Reference was, doubtless, had in such suggestion, to the statements of the complaint stricken out by order of the court below, acquiesced in by the plaintiffs, tending to show collusion between the county officials and the wrong-doers, and the difficulties by reason of such collusion and complicity, in the way of an effective prosecution of an action by the county. Those statements are not now in the record, and the position and relation of the pres ent government of the county to the defendants is supposed to have been changed. Whether this be so or not is not material upon this appeal, as the record discloses no fact which will take this action or cause of action out of the general principle governing all like cases. It will not answer to ignore well established rules of law and invent new principles and modes of procedure solely by reason of the magnitude of a claim or the enormity of a wrong, so long as there is a party in whom the cause of action is vested, able and willing to prosecute, and established rules of law and familiar modes of procedure give an ample remedy to enforce the right and redress the wrong.\nTo sustain this action upon the ground that the individuals acting in the transaction, under the statute, were State agents and not the agents of the county, would lead to serious results, and greatly embarrass the State in respect to the many millions of municipal obligations which have been incurred under legislative authority, only differing in the form and method of execution from that exercised in this case. The State cannot make the actors State agents without assuming the position and responsibility of principal, especially, if the agency is, as is claimed here, of a character entitling the State to the fruits and benefits of the agency. To sustain the action upon the ground of State sovereignty, and a general State guardianship over municipal corporations and their rights and property interests, without legislation upon this subject, and hold that for an invasion of the property rights of a public corporation an action will lie in the discretion and at the instance of the attorney-general, in the name of the people, to the exclusion of or concurrent with a like right of action in the corporation damnified, would introduce a new and strange doctrine, subverting those by which the rights and obligations of that class of corporations have been governed, and lead to confusion and embarrassment in the future, in the administration of the affairs and redressing of wrongs to the property rights of municipal corporations. The right to bring actions for injuries to their property is expressly conferred and given to counties by statute, and this necessarily excludes the right of the State to bring an action for the same cause. It is not intended to deny that a case may be made in which the attorney-general may, in the name of the people, institute and maintain an action against a wrong-doer, \u00e1nd- the public corporation whose rights have been invaded or threatened, and the governing body of such corporation, to enforce a right, or redress a wrong, or prevent a breach of trust, where the governing body is faithless to its. trust or a party to the wrong. Such a case is not made here, and the question is not before us.\nThe judgment should be affirmed."},{"case_name":"William S. Doughten et al. vs. Peter B.

It is only necessary to remark that trusts for religious and educational purposes, and for the benefit of the poor, the sick, the afflicted, the helpless, are charitable. They are governed by the rules that apply to trusts for private benefit. The intention of the donor is ascertained by 'the application of the same rules of construction. Where, however, it is plain that a public charity is intended, different rules from those applied to private trusts may be invoked in order to give effect to the-intention of the donor, and to establish the charity. A public charity will not fail by reason of the fact that the trustee is uncertain, or is incapable of taking, or that the objects of the charity are uncertain and indefinite. These, however,, would be fatal to gifts for private benefit. The greatest favor has for many centuries been shown by those who make and administer the laws to gifts for public charities. This favor is clearly discernible in the history of Boman legislation and jurisprudence. Writers on the civil law furnish the clearest evidence of the peculiar regard in which testaments, for charitable purposes were held.\nWe all know how favorably gifts for charitable uses were regarded by the early English law. Prior to the enactment of the Statute of Distributions (22 Car. II. chap. 13), the ordinary was obliged to apply a portion of the residue of every intestate estate to charity, on the ground that there was a general principle of piety and charity in every man, or that every man must be presumed to have intended a portion of his goods for the benefit of charity. In 1601 the Statute of 34 Elizabeth, chap. 4, commonly called the Statute of Charitable Uses, was enacted. It is unnecessary to consider the provisions of this statute, or the objects sought to be accomplished by its enactment. I can find no evidence that it has ever been recognized as in force in this State. It is trac that we derive our system of equity jurisprudence from that of England ; but they err who suppose that the jurisdiction of the English Court of Chancery over charities or charitable bequests owed its origin to the provisions of that statute. It is now fully established that the chancellor of England had \u25a0\u25a0and exercised jurisdiction over charities and charitable uses long before that statute. That jurisdiction was of two distinct characters,\u2014ministerial and judicial. The king, as pwms pa-trice, had the administration of all charities. The judicial part of this administration was entrusted to the ordinary equity jurisdiction of the court of chancery. The part not thus entrusted the king exercised, as paid of his prerogative, by his sign manual. This latter part, however, was .generally administered by the chancellor, representing the king as parens patrice. The ministerial function of the chancellor was exercised in cases not cognizable by him acting \u25a0solely in his judicial capacity. Of this class of cases may be mentioned gifts made for charitable uses that were illegal or -contrary to public policy, or that were impossible to be carried into effect, or in cases of charity generally, or to religion \u25a0or education, without directions when, where, or by whom the gift should be applied or used.\nThe principle or doctrine of the exercise of this ministerial function of the English chancellor was what is known as ey pres; that is to say, where there was a definite charitable purpose which co'uld not take place, the court would substitute another, and formerly of a very different character. It was not, however, in the exercise of the judicial function of his office, but in the exercise of his ministerial function, that the English chancellor applied the fund to a different purpose from that contemplated by the testator, provided it was charitable. It has been well remarked that \u201cmost of the cases carry the doctrine beyond what is allowed where private interests are concerned, and have in no inconsiderable degree to draw for their support on the prerogative of the Crown and the Statute of Charitable Uses.\u201d 43 Eliz. chap. 4. The doctrine of ey pres has never been recognized in this State. \u25a0Our court of chancery has been accustomed to exercise only the ordinary or judicial function of the English Court of Chancery; and it is believed that the ordinary powers of a court of equity, applied properly to the subject-matter, are sufficient to carry into effect all charitable bequests reason able in' their character and proper in their objects. While, under our system of equity jurisprudence, charitable bequests to be administered only cy pres cannot be sustained, chancery here, as in England, in the exercise of its judicial functions,\u2014 here it possesses no other,-\u2014will sustain bequests in favor of charity not in contravention of law or public policy and that are capable of being carried into effect by the exercise of the judicial power vested in the court; and where a testator has clearly indicated when, where, how, and by whom his gifts are to be applied or used ; and also in all cases of such charities in which nothing is wanting for their application but a trastee. In the latter case chancery will not allow an otherwise proper trust to fail for want of a trustee, but will supply that want.\nWhat is a charity, a charitable use, a public charity ? In the case in Ambler to which reference will be hereafter made, this definition is given : \u201cA gift to a general public use which extends to the poor as well as the rich.\u201d\nIn Jackson v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 556, Justice Gray says: \u201cA charity, in a legal sense, may be more fully defined as a gift to be applied, consistently with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them -to establish themselves for life, or by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works, or otherwise lessening the burdens of government. It is immaterial whether the purpose is called charitable in the gift itself, if it is so-described as to show that it is charitable in its nature.\u201d\nThese general principles, applicable to public charities, seem sufficiently established by equity decisions. It is immaterial whether the person to take be in esse or not, or whether the legatee were at the time of the bequest a corporation capable of taking or not, or how uncertain the objects may be, provided there be a discretionary power vested anywhere, over the application of the testator\u2019s bounty to those objects, or whether the corporate designation has been mistaken. If the intention sufficiently appears on the bequest, it will be held valid. Witman v. Lex, 17 Serg. & R. 88.\nThe general rule is that where either a corporation or a natural person is so identified by the name and description in ' the will, as applied to the facts and circumstances, as to distinguish such person or corporation from all others, such person or corporation shall take the bequest in the same manner as if no discrepancy had appeared. Minot v. Boston Asylum, 7 Met. 418.\nWhere the name and description in a legacy, when applied to the facts, lead to a reasonable belief that they apply to some one person, and there is no other person to whom they can with any probability apply, then much slighter evidence will be sufficient to prove that that person was intended in the designation. Ibid.\nThe general rule certainly is that the intent of the testator is to govern in the construction, but it is the intention expressed by the will and not otherwise. To get at the intention expressed by the will, every clause and word are to be taken into consideration, because one clause is often modified and explained by another. Every implication, as well as every direct provision, is to be regarded. And further, as a will must necessarily apply to persons and things external, any evidence may be given of facts and circumstances which have any tendency to give effect and operation to the words of the will; such as the names, descriptions, and designations of persons, the relations in which they stood to the testator, the facts of his life, etc. If in the matter of description there is a mistake,\u2014that is, if there is no one who corresponds to the description in all particulars, hut there is one who corresponds in many particulars, and no other who can be intended,\u2014such person will take. Ibid.\nIf the will applies definitely to two or more persons, so that either would be entitled to take under the will but for the existence and claim of the other, then paroi evidence is admissible to prove which was intended. When that proof is supplied, the will operates, by its own force and terms, to give the property to that one, as if such person had been the \u2022only one named or described. The evidence does not create the gift, but simply directs it. When the name or description used in the will does not designate with precision any person; but, when the circumstances come to be proved, so many of them concur as to indicate that a particular person was intended, and no similar conclusive circumstances appear to distinguish and identify any other person,\u2014the person thus .shown to be intended will take.\nW, by will, among other legacies, bequeathed as follows : \u201c To the Marine Bible Society I give \u00a71,000.\u201d There was no such society at the date of the will or at the time of its probate. There had existed some time previously a society by the name of the Boston Young Men\u2019s Marine Bible Society which had been dissolved or become extinct before the death \u25a0of the testator, the meetings of which he had, during his lifetime, occasionally attended, and to the funds of which he had \u2022contributed. The court says: \u201c This misdescription is a slight \u25a0one. There is no other society claiming to be the society intended under this description, and there are various facts introduced and tending to identify this society as the one designated by the testator to receive this legacy. If a testator \u2022errs in the name of the legatee, but sufficiently identifies the person or corporation, such error does not defeat the legacy.\u201d Swinb. Wills, pt. 7, \u00a7 5.\nWhere legatees are mentioned in a will by names which they never in point of fact had, yet they will take upon its being proved that the testator intended them. Winslow v. Cummings, 3 Cush. 362, 363.\nA leading case \u2014 or one that is entitled to be considered such on account of the eminence of the judge announcing the \u2022opinion\u2014upon the subject of charitable bequests, and of a recent date, is that of Domestic & F. Miss. Society\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 425, as is also that of Cresson\u2019s Appeal, Id. 437. The former case decides that a legacy to the missions and schools of the Episcopal church about to be established at or near\u2019 Port Cresson upon the western coast of Africa is a good charitable bequest to the Domestic & Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United. States of America, by whom the mission at Port Cresson was-established, and upon whom it is dependent for support; and. that in case of a charitable bequest it is immaterial how vague,, indefinite, and uncertain the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty may be, provided there is a discretionary power vested in. someone over its application; that the law regards the substance of the gift, and, in f\u00e1vor of charity, vests it in the party capable of taking it, in whose ease it was given; and that paroi evidence is receivable to show the situation in which the testator stood towards the objects of his charity, and to designate who were intended by the will to be the-recipients of his bounty.\nIn the latter case paroi evidence was received to show that-a bequest to the \u201cKefuge for Decayed Merchants \u201d was-intended for a charitable society incorporated under the name-of the Merchants\u2019 Fund.\nI shall attempt no enumeration of the objects which have been adjudged charitable. They are almost innumerable. It is not necessary to do so in this case. If the legatees under this will are designated with sufficient accuracy, and if the objects of the testatrix\u2019s bounty are sufficiently ascertained, or are capable of being ascertained, so that the bequests may be beneficially applied, there can be no question as to the charitable nature of the bequests, except as to the bequest to the= \u201c trustees or managers of the Philadelphia Waterworks.\u201d This bequest must fail. The Philadelphia Waterworks are-not a public charity. The bequest is not good at common law, because there is no such corporation as the Trustees or Managers of the Philadelphia Waterworks, and there are no-fiduciary managers of said works. The only managers of the-works are its legal owner, the city of Philadelphia, and it is-not, to be presumed that the coi'poration styled the Oity of Philadelphia was intended to be the object of the testatrix\u2019s bounty. Trustees are never intended as the beneficial objects of bounty. They are intended as the fiduciaries for others than themselves. They control and manage interests or estates, :not for their personal benefit, but for the benefit of others. .In this bequest the words \u201ctrustees\u201d and \u201cmanagers\u201d were \u2022intended to have substantially the same signification, and were intended to describe persons acting in fiduciary relations. The city of Philadelphia sustains no such relation either to the waterworks or to the persons using the water supplied by them. The city is the absolute owner of the works; it manages the works as its other property, and taxes the property-holders of the city for the use of the water supplied to them. 'The case of Jones v. WilKams, Amb. 651, does not support the city\u2019s claim in this case. In that case, John Williams, by his will, taking notice that the town of Chepstow was much in want of good spring water, and that there was a subscription some time since set on foot for bringing the same to the town, but by some misunderstanding was dropped, gives \u00a31,000, to arise by a sale of his real estate, for the' purpose of bringing spring water from St. Arvins, or elsewhere, to the town of Chepstow, for the use of the inhabitants forever, which is to be laid out by his trustees and executors in bringing the said water to the said town and making conduits and reservoirs; and gives \u00a3200, if wanting, and directs a sum to be left in the Bank of England, or an estate bought with it, which will bring in \u00a310 a year, to keep the waterworks in good order. Clearly this was a gift for a charity. It was, says the court, a gift for a general public use, which extended to the poor as well as the rich. Ho money was exacted for the use of the water. Ho tax was imposed in order to furnish the supply. The testator\u2019s estate was to receive no return in consideration of his bounty. The testator furnished the water freely for the use of all the inhabitants of Chepstow. The city \u25a0of Philadelphia does not furnish, by means of her waterworks, water to the inhabitants of that city, to the poor as well as to the rich, freely and without charge, and is not, therefore, in this respect, the object of a charitable bequest. A corporation \u25a0owned by the State, and supported by a public tax or from government funds, is not the object of a charitable bequest, nor would a corporation belonging to a city, nor a corporation owned by private individuals for supplying any article, however necessary, for which supply a compensation was demanded, be the object of a charitable bequest. The Philadelphia Waterworks are simply property belonging to the city,, and are no more a public charity than a horse or a street car,, or a fire engine owned, controlled, and managed by the city.. I therefore decide that the bequest in the testatrix\u2019s will to-the trustees and managers of the Philadelphia Waterworks is-invalid.\nIn view of the principles hereinbefore stated, and the decisions hereinbefore referred to, do the Orphan Society of\u2019 Philadelphia, the Indigent Widows\u2019 and Single Women\u2019s Society, and the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society, answer with sufficient certainty in designation or description the objects intended by the testatrix, in her will and codicil thereto, as the \u201c trustees of the Orphans\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania; \u201d the \u201c trustees of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania,\u201d and the- \u201c trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania? \u201d\nI will first consider the claim of the Orphan Society of Philadelphia to the bequest made in the will to the \u201ctrustees of the Orphans\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d The designation of the asylum mentioned in the will, and that of the society claiming the fund, is not in all respects the same. The latter takes under a devise or bequest,, not to trustees, but directly in its corporate name, which is the Orphan Society of Philadelphia. If otherwise entitled to the benefit of the fund, the bequest to the trustees instead of to the corporation direct in its corporate name would not, in my opinion, be fatal to the claim. It would in either case be the corporation intended to be benefited, and not the representatives of the corporation. Two things are certain from the consideration of this will, viz. : the testatrix meant that none of her heirs at law should derive any benefit from her estate, and that her estate should be applied to what she corn sidered public charities; and she has attempted to designate corporate agencies through which her charity should be administered. If she really meant the corporations claiming, and there be sufficient proof in the case, either from inspection of the will or otherwise, her intention must prevail notwithstanding a mistake in their designation. I do not regard the difference in designation in itself as sufficient to exclude the claimant from the benefit of the fund if it answers the description of the bequest. The material inquiry is, Is the description of the two\u2014that is to say, is the purpose, object, and character of the two\u2014the same, or so identical as to exclude the idea of uncertainty? The testatrix intended to make an incorporated institution, the object and purpose of which was to benefit or support orphans, her agent in the distribution of her bounty for the benefit or support of orphans. An asylum may be a society, and a society may be an asylum. It is the thing, the corporate being, and not the name of the thing or corporate being, which is material. It is in proof that the claimant was commonly called the Orphans\u2019 Asylum, and it is conceived that there cannot be, in reason, any material distinction between an orphan asylum and an orphan society, when either is regarded or spoken of or meant to be described as an institution for the protection or relief of the unfortunate; and this is one of the definitions of an \u201c asylum,\u201d given by Webster, with examples, as an asylum for the poor, for the deaf and dumb, and, he might have added, for orphans.\nAn incorporated society is an institution. It may be for many purposes. It may be for business, for religious or charitable objects. The purposes for which it is established or instituted will determine its character. If it is a society for orphans, or an orphan society, the general usage, as well as the proper understanding of the term, would determine its character as that of a society for the protection or relief of orphans. An orphan asylum has no other character; nothing else is descriptive of it. There is no orphan asylum in Philadelphia whose corporate name answers the designation in the testatrix\u2019s will nearer than\u2014or as near, in my opinion, as\u2014that of the Orphan Society of Philadelphia. I doubt if there are any an swering. the description so near. The few other orphan asylums referred to in the cause appear to be denominational or class in character. It would have been more satisfactory, if it could have been done, had proof been made that the testatrix had personal knowledge of some particular institution for the benefit of orphans. The omission of this proof, however, ought not to be considered as evidence that she had no knowledge or information of any institution of that character in the city of Philadelphia, an\u2018d of the orphan society in particular. That which was generally known among the friends of the institution may have been known to her personally, and the institution therefore may have been -designated by her by its popular rather than by its corporate name. In her extreme want of charity towards her relatives, in not providing for \u201c those of her own house,\u201d\u2014which high authority has declared to be worse than infidelity,\u2014she seems, nevertheless, to have wished to devote her estate to objects which she considered charitable. There is no other claimant to this bequest, although, by order of the court, publication of notice to all corporations . desiring to claim the same has been made in a paper called the Legal Intelligencer, published in the city of Philadelphia. Considering the length to which courts have gone in order to establish charitable bequests, and that, if the claim of the Orphan Society of Philadelphia is disallowed, the bequest of the testatrix for the benefit of orphans must fail,\u2014whatever may be my private opinion of the propriety and wisdom of the action of the testatrix in disposing of her property as she has done by her will, as a judge, recognizing the decisions of courts in analogous cases, I am constrained to give effect to this bequest, and to decide in favor of the claim thereto made by the Orphan Society of Philadelphia.\nThe same reasoning will apply to the claim of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society. Its designation is not that employed by the testatrix in her will. There is little in common between them; the one is the trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia, and the other is the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society. There is no society or asylum in Philadelphia answering the designation in the will. It is, however, evident from the will itself that the testatrix meant, by her bequest to the trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia, a bequest for the benefit, protection, or support of mariners. Does the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society sufficiently answer the description of a marine society, and such a marine society as the testatrix meant; and did she mean it? If it does not so answer, and if she did not mean it, her bequest to the \u201ctrustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia \u201d must fail; for there is no other claimant to it, and there is no other society proved to exist that can take the \"bequest. Webster defines the word \u201c marine,\u201d as an adjective, \u25a0pertaining to the sea, transacted at sea. \u201c Marine,\u201d as a noun, lie defines to be a soldier that serves on board of a ship and fights in naval engagements. He defines marines to be a body of troops trained to do military service on board of ships. Also the whole navy of a kingdom or state. Again, the whole \u2022economy of naval affairs, comprehending the building, rigging, \u2022equipping, navigating, and management of ships of war in \u25a0engagements. He defines \u201ca mariner\u201d to be a seaman or \u25a0sailor,\u2014one whose occupation is to assist in navigating ships. He defines \u201ca seaman\u201d to be a sailor, a mariner,\u2014a man whose occupation is to assist in the management of ships at sea. He says naval skill is the art of managing a fleet, particularly in an engagement; \u201c a very different thing from seamanship. Hothing is more common than to speak of our naval marine and our commercial marine.\u201d The term \u201c marine \u201d is not exclusively appropriate to either. .It is common to both. It will be observed that the object of the testatrix was to bestow a charity, the recipients of which should be mariners. All the other institutions or societies mentioned or referred to in this cause, having any relation to or connection with the terms \u25a0\u201cmarine\u201d or \u201cseamen,\u201d were either governmental or beneficial, and cannot therefore be considered as objects for charitable bequests or public charities. Section 2 of the charter of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society is as follows: \u201c \u00a7 2. The object of this corporation is to promote the social and moral improvement of seamen at home or abroad.\u201d\nIt is therefore a charitable corporation or institution. NT ow,. although the designation of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society is not the same as that used by the testatrix in th& codicil to her will, to wit, the trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania,\u2014yet, as there is no other claimant of the bequest, nor any other institution in Philadelphia of a charitable character answering to tliedeseription of a marine asylum, which must mean an asylum or society for the benefit, protection, or support of mariners- or seamen, whether naval or commercial; and as it appears-from the charter and the reports of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society that it does meet the description of a marine asylum,\u2014that is, that it is an institution for the benefit-of mariners or seamen; and inasmuch as a court of equity will not allow a charity to fail if it can reasonably be applied,\u2014 I am of opinion, notwithstanding the absence of proof of any general or special knowledge on the part of the testatrix of' the existence of the Pennsylvania Seamen\u2019s Friend Society,, that said society is entitled to the bequest, in the codicil, to the- \u201c trustees of the Marine Society of Philadelphia in the State-of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nThe evidence discloses the existence of no institution or corporation in the city of Philadelphia answering the designation of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania. The name of St. Ann Widows\u2019 Asylum, appears in one of the directories of the city of Philadelphia, made one of the exhibits in this cause. \u00a1Nothing is known of it, however, from the evidence, other than its name, which, would seem to indicate that it is denominational in character. It is not a claimant of the bequest. In a list of some of the-benevolent institutions of the city of Philadelphia, made an exhibit in the cause, there appears to be in that city an institution the corporate name of which is Penn Asylum for Indigent Widows and Single Women of the City of Philadelphia,, which was incorporated in the year 1852, six years after the will was made which contains the bequest. Of course the testatrix could not intend this corporation, and it has not appeared and claimed the bequest. The Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Society, incorporated in 1819, is the only charitable institution or corporation that has appeared and claimed the bequest to the trustees of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of' Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania. James Bayard, a witness examined in the cause, speaking of the claimant, says \u201c I am well acquainted with the Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Asylum of Philadelphia,\u2014have known it about fifty years.\u201d He also says: \u201c In common parlance this institution was called the Widows\u2019 Asylum. Unless it was for some specific business purposes, I never heard it called by the corporate name in common parlance.\u201d He also states that single women were admitted into the institution, and that single women had as much right as widows; that it was not exclusively a widows\u2019 society; that he could not say what proportion of single women and widows had been admitted at any time since its institution; and that its charity extended as well to single women as widows. He also states that members of his family and intimate friends were managers of the institution, and that the name given it by his family and friends in common conversation was the Widows\u2019 Asylum. The rule for the application of charities is that, where a charity is given to any object by special designation or description, and that-designation or description equally applies to two or more objects, the charity will fail from the want of certainty as to the particular object intended; but that which would be otherwise uncertain in such a case may be rendered reasonably or absolutely certain by paroi evidence indicating the particular charity intended. Of this description of evidence would be the proof of the testator\u2019s relation to the particular institution, if an institution be the object of the charity; the name by which, one of the institutions, if there were more than one claiming, was commonly called; and any other circumstance tending to-show the particular charity intended. In the forty-seventh, annual report of the managers of the Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Society, for the year 1863, which I find among the exhibits in the cause, is the following: \u201c The storm which has broken over our unhappy country has as yet been unfelt \u2022within the walls of-the society\u2019s asylum.\u201d Again: \u201cMost of the applicants are deserving gentlewomen, who have fallen into \u25a0poverty in the decline of life, and whose education has taught them to shrink from dependence on individual charity.\u201d In their twenty-eighth annual report, for the year 1844, is the following: \u201c This society is founded for the relief of aged and \u2022indigent women. It recognizes no sectarian preferences. The only requisites for participation in its charities are advanced age, destitution, and meritorious character.\u201d Again: \u201c It is especially designed to provide an asylum for those whose earlier lives have heen passed in the more refined walks of life, and whom experience therefore has not inured to the struggle of penury.\u201d As the testatrix, in her bequest to the trustees of the Orphans\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia, must have meant to hestow a charity upon orphans, and in her bequest to the Marine Asylum of Philadelphia must have meant to \"bestow a charity for the benefit of seamen, so in her bequest to the Widows\u2019 Asylum of Philadelphia she must have intended a charity in favor of widows. The society claiming the bequest does not answer the designation of the asylum mentioned in the will; but the charity answers the description \u2022of the charity intended by the will, unless the participation of single women in the charity administered by the claimant renders the description dissimilar. I cannot suppose that a \u2022charity including that mentioned in the will, but more extensive in its benefits, and extended to an equally meritorious nlass of persons of destitute condition, especially as the charity is or may be given to the corporation by its popular, and not its corporate, designation, can have that effect. For these and ihe additional reasons assigned in reference to the other charitable bequests hereinbefore considered, I shall decree the Indigent Widows and Single Women\u2019s Society of Philadelphia -entitled to the bequest to the \u201c trustees of the Widows\u2019 Asylum of the city of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d I have not overlooked the fact that each one of these bequests-to intended charitable institutions has been directed, in the will and codicil, to be applied to the institutions or corporations respectively. This form of bequest, however, I regard as no more or less than a direction that the benefits of the bequests shall be enjoyed by the classes of persons respectively for whose benefit those institutions or corporations-exist.\nI am aware that I have in this opinion gone quite far enough in the application of well-recognized equitable principles to charitable uses. It would not have been a matter of regret to me if I had been able to arrive at different conclusions. There is nothing in' the will of Amy Doughten, with, respect to these charitable bequests, at the expense of her relatives in blood, that meets the approval of my judgment. Her example in this respect I would not commend as worthy of imitation ; and nothing but a sense of duty, which compels-me to follow the law as expounded by courts of equity, has caused me to give an interpretation to the provisions of her will and the codicil thereto by which her heirs at law are excluded from the benefit of sharing her estate."},{"case_name":"Attorney General ex rel. Hecker v. Rumford Chemical Works and others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6729851\/","date":"1876-05-01","court":"United States Circuit Court for the District of Rhode Island","content":"Shepley, J.\nThe information in this case is by \u201cGeorge H. Williams, as he is attorney general of the United States of America,\u201d at the relation ox George V. Hecker, of the city of New York, against the Rumford Chemical Works, a corporation duly organized under the laws of the state of Rhode Island, and a citizen of said state, and domiciled therein, and against George F. Wilson, a citizen of the state of Rhode Island, as president of said corporation, and its general manager.\nThe information showeth that letters patent of the United States were on the twenty-second day of April, 1856, granted to Ebon N. ilorsford for a new and improved preparation or substance being a substitute for a pulverulent acid for use in the manufacture of dry powders and other similar powders when a dry acid is required; that thereafter the letters patent became vusted in the Rumford Chemical Works, as assignee of Ilorsford. Two surrenders and reissues of the patent are then set out in the information, the first reissue being dated May 7, 1867, and numbered 2,597, and the second, J une 9, 18(58, and numbered 2,979. The reissue 2,979 is alleged to have been wrongfully and fraudulently obtained, and to be null and void by reason of claiming that which is not described in the original letters patent of Ilorsford, and 'that which was not the invention of Ilorsford as described in his original patent. The third claim of tho reissued patent is alleged to be void, not only as claiming an invention not described in the original patent, and not the invention of Horsford at the date thereof, but for want of any such description in either the original or reissued letters patent of the invention therein claimed, in such full, clear, and exact terms as to comply in that respect with the requirements of law. The fourth claim is alleged to be void also, because the subject-matter thereof is not described in the original patent, and because the subject-matter of the claim is not described with sufficient accuracy to enable a. person skilled in tho art most nearly allied thereto to successfully make and use the same.\nTho information further shows that on the seventeenth of June, 1868, tho Rumford Chemical Works filed a bill in equity in the circuit court of the United States for the Southern district of New York, against one John E. Eauer, alleging infringement of letters patent No. 2,979; that Lauer was an employe of the relator, George V. Hecker, and his partner, John Hooker; that the alleged acts of infringement were done in the course of said employment, and the defense of the suit was assumed by the Hookers; that, after a full hearing before his honor, Judge Blatchford, one of the judges of said court, it was adjudged and decreed that the first and second claims of said patent were void for want of novelty; that on or about the thirteenth day of September, 1869,. the Rumford Chemical Works,filed another hill in equity, in the same court, against the Heckers, alleging infringement of said letters patent No. 2,979; and that thereupon, and after the decree ip the suit in equity against Lauer, upon the application of the complainant, the cause against Lauer was reopened and further, proofs were taken in the cause. Proofs were also taken in the cause against the Heckers, and, by stipulation of the parties, the testimony taken in the Lauer Case was used in the Hecker Case, and, after a full hearing, it was adjudged and decreed in both cases that the first, second, and third claims of reissued patent No. 2,979 were void for want of novelty, and that the defendant George V. Hecker had infringed the fourth claim of said letters patent.\nAn allegation is then made that the question of the validity of the fourth claim was not argued or'heard in that trial, and that it is invalid for the reasons before stated; that the cause was referred to a master to take account of profits made by the defendants in infringement of the fourth claim, and it does not appear that such accounting has been completed, or any final-decree made in the cause. The information sets out the grounds upon which the court adjudged and decreed the first, second, and third claims of the patent to be void for want of novelty, and also the grounds upon which it is now' alleged that the first, second, third, and fourth claims of the reissued patent ar\u00e9 void for want of novelty or patentability; and that, before the expiration of the original term for which letters patent were granted, the same were extended for the term of seven years, and the extended term was duly assigned to the Rumford Chemical Works. The information proceeds to give the requisite notice of prior publications relied upon to prove that I-Iorsford was not the original and first inventor of the inventions described and claimed in the several claims of the patent.\nAllegation is then made that, since the filing of the bills against Lauer and Hecker, the Rumford Chemical Works have instituted a large number of suits, in different circuits, against persons charged with infringing reissue No. 2,979, which alleged infringements consist, in some cases, in the-resale of packages of flour prepared and sold to them by Hecker, for which preparation and sale the Heckers, and Lauer, their employe, were sued in the aforementioned suits; that, all such suits being against customers of the said Heckers, they are obliged to assume the defense, and that thereby they are subjected to great vexation and expense, inasmuch as in those suits the complainant endeavors to maintain the validity of all the claims of the patent. The information further alleges that the Rumford Chemical Works has instituted a suit in equity against George V. Hecker, in the circuit court of the United States for the district of New Jersey, for alleged infringement of reissue No. 2,979, and threatens to institute other suits against other defendants for using and selling the same flour for the making and using of which the Heckers were sued in the Southern district of Hew York; that although the fourth claim of the patent was adjudged to be valid, yet the informant believes that the decree was unadvisedly made, and that the judgment of the court sustaining said claim cannot be revised at the private instance of the defendants therein, save by the supreme court of the United States, on appeal from the final decree, which final decree cannot be made until the completion of the accounting, and during the pendency of the accounting the decree is being used for harassing and vexatious litigation under said claim; that there are valid and subsisting patents, granted according to law and now owned by the Heckers, the use of the inventions secured by said patents being greatly impeded and injured by the aforesaid doings of the Rumford Chemical Works, and by the. existence of the reissued patents aforesaid. The prayer is that the reissufid patent Ho. 2,979 should be declared void, and be 'canceled and annulled, and that the Rumford Chemical Works be enjoined from prosecuting any suit at law or in equity for alleged infringements of the same. The bill is signed by George H. Williams, attorney general of the United States, by John A. Gardner, attorney of the United States in and for the district of Rhode Island. A motion was made and filed to set aside the service of the subpoena, and take the information from the files. The evidence offered under this motion was ordered to be filed and made a part of the record in the cause.\nInasmuch as the principal questions presented on the hearing of the motion are raised by the demurrer, the court decided to hear the parties oil the bill and demurrer, and further consideration of the motion is unnecessary. Defendants demur to tho bill on the grounds, briefly stated \u2014 First, that informant does not state any case which entitles him to relief against these defendants; second, that the informant had no lawful authority to file this information ; third, that the information and this proceeding are not in the name or in behalf of the United States; fourth, that tlie informant, \u201cas ho is attorney general of the United States,\u201d had no lawful authority to file this information ; fifth, that the informant has not signed the said bill or information, nor has counsel signed the same; sixth, that this court lias no jurisdiction under the constitution and laws of tho United States, to entertain this information and proceed therewith; seventh, that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the said information, or to proceed therewith, because it appears that the United States are not parties thereto, of petitioners or plaintiffs therein;: eighth, that this court has no jurisdiction, because it does not appear that the piar ties are citizens of different states.\nA patent for a useful invention is not, under the laws of the United States, a monopoly in the old sense of the common law. The whole patent system of tlie United States rests upon the basis of the constitutional provision conferring upon congress the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts, by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive rigid to their respective writings and discoveries.= So long as such writings and discoveries were not communicated to the public, authors and inventors had a possession of, which was equivalent to a property in, their writings and discoveries. When communicated to the public, by the common law that property was lost. In consideration that an inventor will disclose the secret of his invention, and put it in immediate, practice, and afford to the public the opportunity to practice it, when it becomes public property at the expiration of tlu; term of the patent, the government grants to the author of a new and useful invention the exclusive right in that invention for a term ot years. This grant is not the exercise of any prerogative to confer upon one or more of the subjects of a government the exclusive property iii that which would otherwise belong to the common right. It more nearly resembles a contract, which under the authority conferred by tlie constitution, congress authorizes to be entered into between the government and the inventor, securing to him, for a limited time, tho exclusive enjoyment of the practice of his invention, in consideration of the disclosure of his secret to the public, and his relinquishment of Ins invention to the public at the end of the term. To the legislation of congress, and to this alone, we must resort, under our form of government, for guidance as to the extent, limitations, and conditions of tlie respect ive rights of inventors and tlie public, and as to the forms of remedy and the remedial jurisdiction, as well as the remedy itself, under our system ol\u2018 patent law. Bo far as any inquirymayrelaieto the relations between the gov-eminent and the grantee of letters patent of tho United States, but little light can be reflected from tlie English decisions. Originating, as their system of patent law did, in a supposed right of tlie king, residing in his royal'prerogative, to create monopolies, and continued under the authority of the act of Parliament of 21 James I., which, while prohib\u00ed) ing by the statute of monopolies' the granting of exclusive privileges in trade, excepted letters patent for tlie sole working or making of any manner of new manufacture within the realm to the first and true inventors of such manufactures, it evidently rests upon a different basis from a system founded solely upon the express grant of power in a written constitution.\nAs in England the grant of a patent is a matter of grace and favor, the crown may annex any conditions it pleases to the grant. Every English patent contains a proviso which makes the grant it contains revocable by the queen, or by any six of her privy council, for certain causes, which are mentioned in the proviso. These causes are stated in the proviso to be, if the grant be contrary to law, or prejudicial or inconvenient to her majesty\u2019s subjects, or if the invention was not new, or not invented by the patentee. Hind. Pat. c. 10, \u00a7 7. This provision is an affirmance of the law that the queen cannot do anything against the law, or against right and justice; hence the maxim that the queen cannot do wrong. Therefore all her letters patent which are contrary to law or common justice, or which are to the prejudice of the commonwealth, or to the general injury of the people, are null and void, and every grant from the queen has this condition either expressly or tacitly annexed to it, that it be not .a grievance or prejudice to her majesty\u2019s subjects, and if a grant be contrary to this condition it is void. Co. Litt. 90 B; Chit. Prerog. 178; Bac. Abr. \u201cPrerog.\u201d F 2; Shep. Abr. \u201cPrerog.\u201d pt. 3, 48. \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7. The statute of monopolies, 21 Jac. I. c. 3, \u00a7 6, provides also that patents for inventions \u201cshall not be contrary to law, nor mischievous to the state by rais ing prices of commodities at home, or hurt of trade or generally inconvenient.\u201d Letters patent are not dernandable in England as matter of right. .In practice they are rarely refused, but are granted on application properly made, the reason being that the grant is entirely at the risk of the petitioner for the patent. As the letters patent issued under the great seal,- and the enrollment of every patent remained of record in the court of chancery, the lord chancellor, in the common-law court of chancery, \u2014 or, in the words of Sir Edward Coke in the fourtheinstitute, the \u201cone ordinary coram domino rege incaucel-laria, wherein the lord chancellor or lord keeper of the great seal proceeds according to the right line of the laws and statutes of the realm secundum legem et consuetudinem angliai,\u201d \u2014 has power to hold plea of scire facias to repeal letters patent under the great seal, and to cancel the patent, and also the enrollment of it. King v. Butler, 3 Lev. 221, and 2 Vent. 344. The scire facias being a judicial writ, and founded upon a record, properly issued from the court of chancery, as the patent was a record in chancery. Sir Edward Coke says, (4 Inst. 88:) \u201cOur lord chancellor of Engl and is called cancdlarius, a cancellendo, i. e\u201e a dignioriparte; being the highest point of his jurisdic tion to cancel the king\u2019s letters patent under the great seal, and damning the enrollment thereof by drawing strikes through it like a lattice.\u201d The form of a writ of scire facias, which issued from the court of chancery, commanded the sheriff to give notice to the patentee to appear in chancery, and show why the letters patent and enrollment should not be canceled, and the letters patent restored into chancery, there to be canceled.\nThese legal proceedings were in the office called the \u201cPetty Bag,\u201d the office of the court of chancery, in which all common-law proceedings of the court were carried on, all the pleadings and other common-law proceedings being entitled, \u201cIn the Petty Bag Office in Chancery.\u201d The action of scire facias was not only a remedy provided by law for the crown in behalf of the public, but also for any subject of the crown who could show that a void or illegal patent operated to his prejudice. Thus, in Butler's Case, before cited, Lord Chancellor Finch said: \u201c Where a patent is granted to the prejudice of the subject, the king, of right, is to permit him upon his petition to use his name for the repeal of it.\u201d Every person is presumed to have such an interest in a patent for an invention that, if he alleges that it is illegal or void, he is entitled, as of right, to a scire facias in the name of the queen, in order to repeal it. Queen v. Aires, 10 Mod. 354; Queen v. Ballivos, 1 P. Wms. 207; Tin. Abr. \u201cPrerogative,\u201d T. b.; U. b. 8. Such proceedings were always in the name of the crown. \u201cThe only means which tho law provides for the repealing of letters patent [for inventions] is by action of soire facias at the suit of the queen,\u201d (Hind. Pat. 64,) and, as we have seen, this was a quasi common-law proceeding, with the right of trial by jury. This right, and this mode or proceeding, was preserved by the express provisions of the modern statut s, which, while providing for a new seal to patents, and for filing the specifications in such office as the new commissioners might designate, also enacted that \u201cthe writ of soire facias shall lie for the repeal of any letters patent issued under this act in the like case as the same would lie for the repeal of letters patent which may now be issued under tho great seal.\u201d Ho instance can be found, it is believed, of any other proceeding in England than a soire facias to repeal letters patent for an invention. It is contended in tho case at liar that the case of Attorney General v. Vernon, 1 Vern. 277, is an authority for the repeal of letters patent by a bill in chancery. But this case was without a precedent, and has never been followed in England, and cannot be claimed to be a precedent for a bill in equity to repeal letters patent for an invention which issue under tiie great seal, and are recorded in chancery. The question related to letters patent which purported to grant, to Col. Vernon certain rights and privileges connected with the honor of t\u00edudbury, and the manor of .Sudbury, and other landed estates. Lord Chief Baron Montague, as to tho objection that there was no precedent of any such suit brought into this court, said: \u201cThis court creates precedents, \u201d and the Lord Chancellor Jeffries, in allusion to what had been proved in tiie case, that Vernon had been a devoted and loyal adherent of the late King Charles I., and had by reason thereof suffered greatly in his person and estate, and been imprisoned in tho Tower, answered: \u201cThat Col. Vernon has been very loyal, and that his service and sufferings for the crown have been considerable, must be admitted;\u201d but he goes on to decree that the patent must be delivered up and canceled upon two grounds -First, that \u201cCol. Vernon had before that time tasted of the king\u2019s bounty both in England and Ireland;\u201d and also, \u201cthough Col. Vernon was an honest gentleman and of good quality, tho honor of Sudbury is of that vast extent, and so many noblemen hold of it that it is not fitting for a person of his degree. \u201d\nComparing tho system of rights and remedies, so far as they refer to the. relations between the. government and the subject in England and this country, we find these strongly marked differences: Letters patent for inventions in England are grants male by the crown de gratia specials; the words \u201cof our special grace\u201d in the patent importing that the grant proceeds merely from the grace and bounty of the crown, the grantee having no right or title to the grant, except through the favor of tho crown. 2 Co. Inst. 78; Hind. Pat. 50. In this country they are issued, neither in fact nor by publication, by any special grace or favor, and in no sense ex mero mota, but as a matter of right, under the provisions of a statute, to the inventor who has complied with the conditions which the statute imposes. In England, before the statutes of 12 & 18 and 15 & 16 Vict., tho letters patent issued under tho great seal, and were on record in tho court of chancery. In the United States the record of the patent is in the patent-office, and under the seal of the patent-office. In England tho patent issues to the applicant as a matter of course on his application, the grant being entirely at tho risk of the petitioner. By our statute the letters patent aro not issued until the commissioner of patents has caused an examination to be made, and until it appears, upon such examination, that tho claimant is j ustly entitled to a patent under the law, and that tho same is sufficiently new and important. From the decision of the examiner, or of the examiner-in-chief in charge of the interferences, an appeal is provided to the board of examiners, and from their decision the party dissatisfied may appeal to the commissioner in person. If such party, except a party to an interference, is dissatisfied with the decision of the commissioner, he may appeal to the supreme court of the District of Columbia, sitting in lane; and after all these proceedings, if the patent be refused, the applicant may have a remedy by bill in equity. Also, in ease of interfering patents, the remedy is not by scire facias at the instance of the relator, as in England, but the statute provides for a suit in equity by the owner or other person interested in the working of the invention, brought against the owner of the interfering patent. In England the law gives to the party aggrieved by the issue of the letters patent his right to his remedy of scire facias, brought and conducted at his expense by the attorney general, in the name and in behalf of the queen, to repeal the patent. ISTo statute in this country confers or recognizes the existence of any such right, nor can any precedent be found for the suing out of a writ of scire facias, or the bringing of a bill in equity to repeal the patent by the attorney general in the name and behalf of the United States, either with or without a relator.\nUnder our system of patent law, where the issue of letters patent is either a quasi decision at the patent-office, or an actual judicial decision on appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision, and where the statute so carefully guards the rights of defendants in actions brought by owners of patents, we could entertain no doubt, in the absence of any statute provisions authorizing proceedings by the attorney general of the United States, either as in this instance, in his own name, \u201cas he is attorney general,\u201d or in the name and behalf of the United States, that no right to institute such a proceeding existed, were it not for the high respect which this court entertains for any suggestion coming from the supreme court of the United States, whose decisions are binding' upon this bourt, and whose dicta even are entitled to be treated with the respect and consideration due the high authority and profound learning of that court.\nThe case of Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 434, was one of two interfering patents. Mowry having been sued by Whitney for practicing the invention described in Mowry\u2019s patent, which Whitney alleged to be an infringement of his (Whitney\u2019s) prior, existing, and extended patent; and, Whitney having obtained a decree against Mowry in that suit in chancery, Mowry filed, in his own name, a bill against Whitney, alleging in substance that Whitney had obtained the extension of his patent by false suggestion, by falsely representing that his profits under the patent had been very small, when, in fact, they had been very large. There was a demurrer to the bill upon the grounds \u2014 First, that the extended patent had expired by its own limitation before the bill was filed; second, that the complainant could not, in his own right, maintain such a suit. The court did not deem it necessary to decide the first point. In deciding the second, the court, (Mr. Justice Miller,) stating the ancient mode of vacating a patent in the English courts by scire facias, states the three cases in which this may be done in those courts: First, when the king, by his letters patent, has by different patents granted the same thing to several persons, the first patentee shall have a scire facias to repeal -the second; second, when the king has granted a thing by false suggestion he may by scire facias, repeal his own grant; third, .when he has granted that which by law lie cannot grant, he, jure regis, and for the advancement of justice and right, may have a scire facias to repeal his own letters patent. The learned judge then, observing that the sixteenth section of the patent act of 1836 seems to have in view the same distinction made by the common law in regard to annulling of patents, proceeds to decide that the remedy under that section, to try the conflicting claim in chancery, is limited to individuals claiming under conflicting patents, or one whose claim to a patent has been rejected because his invention was covered by a patent already issued, and authorizes the court to annul or set aside a patent so far as may be found necessary to protect the Eight, and that the suit by individuals is limited to that class of cases, and that the general public is left to the protection of the government and its of- fleers. Tlie case decided, and only decided, that an interfering patentee of an individual could not, in his own name or in his own rigid, maintain such a bill in equity to vacate a patent upon the ground of false suggestion or fraud in obtaining tlie patent. The authority of this decision, or the conclusiveness of the reasoning in support of the decision, has never been doubted. In England, when the king had granted letters patent for an invention by false suggestion, the scire facias, brought by the king\u2019s attorney general, to repeal tlie king's own grant, was in tlie king\u2019s name and on his own behalf, and not at tlie suit of a, subject. And boro, by the act of 1836, it was not intended to confer upon an interfering patentee tlie right to try such a question by a suit in bis own name, which would be conclusive only inter partes, and leave the same question open, as the court in that case observes, to innumerable vexatious suits to set aside the patent, since a decree in favor of the patentee in one suit would be no bar to a suit by another party. It is true that, in deciding this question, the learned judge says, what is unquestionably true, that \u201cthe general public is loft to tlie protection of the government and its officers \u201d in cases like the one alleged in Mowry v. Whitney, of false suggestion or fraud in obtaining a patent. The court did decide that \u201cno one but tlie government, either in its own name or tlie name of its appropriate, officer, or by some form of proceeding which gives official assurance of the sanction of the proper authority, can institute judicial proceedings for the purpose of vacating or rescinding the patent which the government lias issued to an individual, except in the cases provided for in section 16 of the act of July 4, 1836.\u201d Tlie court did not decide, and in that case was not called upon to decide, what protection to tlie general public, by tlie government and its officers, had been provided by law; or whether, in tlie absence of any express statute provision, or in addition to such statute provisions as are designed to protect the rights of the general public, any further and additional right exists in any executive department of the government to institute any form of proceeding to repeal the grant, by virtue of any supposed prerogative, or any supposed relation of the government to the general public, like that under which the king jure reyis may institute proceedings to repeal his own grant, or as parens patria: may intervene in his own name for the benefit of liis subjects, at their relation and expense, to repeal a grant supposed to lie prejudicial to them. \"Whether any power had been conferred by statute upon, any officer of the government to institute such proceedings, or whether any such right or power existed anywhere in the executive department, in the absence of statute provisions conferring the power and prescribing tlie mode of proceeding, isa question which the court can only decide \u201cwhen a case arises in which tlie United States or the attorney general shall initiate a suit to have \u00e1 patent declared null ab initio,\u201d and tlie court, in tlie language last quoted, defers its decision upon the effect of such a proceeding (under a particular state of facts stated in the opinion) to tlie time when such a case shall arise.\nThis leads us to tlie consideration of tlie protection afforded by the provisions of the patent acts to the rights of the general public, and to the history of the legislation upon that branch of the subject. The fifth section of the act of 1760, the first act of congress in relation to tho subject, (1 St. at Large, 111,) provided a form and mode of proceeding to repeal a patent \u201cobtained surreptitiously, by or upon false suggestion,\u201d upon complaint made under oath before the judge of the district court where tlie defendant resided, and motion within a year after issuing of the patent, but not afterwards. The \u00a1latent issued under this act without any oath of the applicant and any previous examination, and want of novelty anil originality are not included in the list of defenses authorized by tlie sixth section. The act of 1793 extended tlie time of limitation for commencing proceedings to repeal the patent to three years, and enlarged the defenses in actions for infringement, opening the defenses of want of novelty and originality. These provisions clearly show that it was deemed necessary that authority for proceedings to repeal letters patent conferred by statute.\nIn ex parte Wood, 9 Wheat. 609, the courts say: \u201cAs the patents are not enrolled in the records of any court, but among the rolls of the department of state, it was necessary to give some directions as to the character, time, and manner of instituting proceedings to repeal them.\u201d These acts of 1790 and 1793, including these provisions conferring jurisdiction upon the federal courts, over proceedings for the repeal of letters patent, were repealed by the act of 1836. That act was substantially re-enacted and codilied by the act of 1870, and in the Revised Statutes of 1874. The act of 1836 contained no provision authorizing any proceeding to repeal letters patent upon the ground that they were obtained \u201csurreptitiously, by or upon false suggestion;\u201d but the sixteenth section provided a remedy in the case of conflicting patents, and for a repeal of the one which the court should adjudge had been improvidently issued. This takes the place of the remedy to which, in case of conflicting grants, the subject is entitled to, as matter of right, in England.\nFor the protection of the general public, in place of the provision for a proceeding in the nature of a scire facias to repeal the patent, to be instituted within three years, as provided in the act of 1793, it sought to provide safeguards against the issue of letteis patent upon false suggestion, and ample security against any injury to the citizen, to-whom it opened every possible defense against injury resulting from any mistake or oversight of the commissioner in issuing the patent. In fact, every defense against a patent that can well be imagined was left open to the citizen whose interests were affected by it, excepting only the one which in Whitney v. Mowry, the supreme court decided was not open, \u2014 the question of fraud upon the government in obtaining the grant. To guard against such a fraud, it provided for the examination by the examiner, and for a commissioner, and the subsequent proceedings hereinbefore stated; it being made the duty of the examiner and the commissioner to protect the rights of the public. The jurisdiction conferred by Acts of 1790 and 1793 upon the federal courts to repeal a patent, and which, without express grant, it is believed did not inhere in those courts, is nowhere conferred by the Acts of 1886 or 1870 or in the Revised Statutes of 1874. It would seem to be a great stretch of power and assumption of jurisdiction for one circuit court, in the absence of any such express authority conferred by act of congress, to repeal and vacate a patent which may have been originally granted upon the decree of another circuit court, upon appeal from the commissioner, and adjudged valid, perhaps, in litigation respecting it, in stiil another circuit court in another circuit. The better opinion upon this brief and imperfect review of the legislation of congress upon this subject would seem to be that congress had deliberately transferred the jurisdiction over the question of the protection of the rights of the general public, to the quasi judicial decision of the examiner and the commissioner, or the actual judicial decision of tile federal courts upon appeal from the commissioner, and fully protected the rights of the individuals against whom the patents might be sought to be enforced by opening to them every defense essential to the preservation of their rights and the protection of their interests.\nThe decision in the federal courts, sustaining proceedings in equity to vacate letters patent granting lands obtained by fraud, furnish no precedent in case of letters patent for inventions. The United States as an owner of lands, has equal rights, and is entitled to equal remedies, with an individual owner. In granting lands, the United States conveys that in which it has the fee. In issuing letters patent for inventions, nothing is gianted which belonged before to the United States. The issue of the letters patent is in compliance with an act of congress. The rights and remedies of the parties are dependent solely on the statute enactments, and do not grow out of any previous ownership of the supposed subject of the grant, as in the case of a conveyance of lands, lint if this court has jurisdiction over any proceeding to vacate a patent, and declare it null ah initio, upon the ground of false suggestion, or the ground that the government lias undertaken to grant that which by law it cannot grant, it is perfectly clear that \u201cthe attorney general of the United States, as he is attorney general,\u201d has no authority, as such, and in his own name, to filo an information or commence proceedings by bill in equity. It is undoubtedly in (he power of congress to confer upon any public officer the authority to commence suits in his own name on behalf of the United Slates. Such authority has been conferred by statute upon the postmaster general to institute suits in his own name for the recovery of debts and balances due the general post-office. No such authority to institute suits in his own name has been conferred by statute upon the attorney general, in the absence of any such authority, the information (if the court lias jurisdiction to entertain it) should be in the name of the United States, and, I think, should be filed by llie attorney of the United States, in the district in which the information is hied, \u201cin the name and behalf of the United States.\u201d The United States, then being a party to the proceedings, it would not abate by the death or resignation of the public officer who filed it. George H. Williams has resigned, and ceased to bo attorney general; as an individual lie cannot maintain his proceeding. The United States is not made a party; the, relator is not the party. \u201cThe relators are not plaintiffs.\u201d U. S. v. Doughty, 7 Blatchf. 424; Attorney General v. The Mayor, 1 Moll. 95; Attorney General v. Wright, 3 Beav. 447. \u2018delators should know they are not parties io informations, and have no right, of their own authority, to make any application to the court.\u201d There is no party plaintiff before the court, unless it be George H. Williams as an individual citizen. \u201cThis court can recognize the United States as a plaintiff on the record only when the record shows that the United States appears as plaintiff, by the district attorney of this district.\u201d U. S. v. Doughty, 7 Blatchf. 425. In England the scire facias, in the common-law division, or in the petty bag in chancery, to repeal a patent, was always in the name of the sovereign. \u201cThe scire facias,\u201d says Lord Campbell in Reg. v. Archipelago Co., 1 El. & Bl. 351, \u201cin all cases must be in the name of the king.\u201d The form of the writ recites that A.. 11., \u201cattorney general for our said lady, the queen, who for our said lady, the queen, prosecutes in this behalf;\u201d and that this has been the invariable rule in England will appear by an examination of every reported ease in that country, in which this jurisdiction to repeal letters patent by scire facias lias been exercised.\nIn Benton v. Woolsey, 12 Pet. 27, where no objection was made to an information filed by the district attorney \u201cin behalf of the United States, \u201d the court thought, in the absence of any objection, \u201cthe United States may be considered the real party, though in form it is the information and complaint of the district attorney.\u201d The usual and proper mode is for the district attorney to file an information in the name and in behalf of the United States, and probably only in that form could one be sustained, if objected to. The power (conferred by section 359 of the Bevised Statutes of the United States on the attorney general) to, in person, conduct and argue any ca.se in any court of the United States in which the United States is interested, or to direct the solicitor general, or any officer of the department of justice, to do so, clearly does not authorize him to bring such suit in liis own name, or authorize the solicitor general or any officer of the department of justice to do so. If the power given to him, wherever he deems it for the interest of the United States to conduct and argue any case in any court of the United States in which the United States is interested, confers upon him any authority to commence or institute proceedings, except through the district attorneys, who are subject to ins orders and supervision, which is at least doubtful, there is no right expressly given, or to be implied from any words in this or any other statute, to bring the suit in his own name, instead of in the name of the real party, the United States.\nThe conclusion, therefoie, follows that this information to repeal letters patent for an invention, being in the name of George II.

In political science, there are those who would reduce government to a mere skeleton of absolutely necessary powers, purely political; and those who favor paternal government, recognizing in the sovereignty much of the authority of patriarchal rule. All this is seen chiefly in political discussions; \"but the late reports show that these conflicting theories are finding their way into judicial tribunals. The business of courts, however, is not to correct, but to administer, the existing system of government.\nSome authorities cited in this case, and the logical tendency of part of the argument, would go to question the right of the state to make involuntary provision for the care of the destitute, whom misfortune or folly have rendered incapable of caring for themselves. But the political necessity and duty of the sovereignty to make provision for the care of subjects or citizens, unable for any cause to take care of themselves, and destitute of other care, has been too long recognized in all civilized countries, too well established under the state governments of this country, to be regarded as an open question. All public asylums,- here and elsewhere in the country, for the poor, for the insane, for orphans, for the helpless and desti tute by any cause, are witnesses to the political necessity of jniblic charity. And we assume, as a principle underlying every consideration in this case, that it is the duty and policy of the state to provide efficient means, in its discretion, for the care of all destitute and helpless persons within it; that public charity, in such cases, is a public necessity.\nIn fulfilling this duty, as in all things else, the power of the legislature is subject to all positive provisions of the constitution; perhaps to what Judge Eedeield calls the abstractions of state constitutions; and to those natural and fundamental principles of right and justice, which are recognized in all civilized countries, and enter into all civilized governments. And the main question in this case is, whether the industrial school act, ch. 325 of 1875, in its essential provisions, is in conflict with any of these.\nWe confess that we approach the consideration of the statute with a strong desire to uphold it. Theoretically, the provision for the support of the poor is very well. Practically, poor houses are perhaps often, sometimes certainly, administered with as little attention to the comfort and as little respect for the persons of their inmates, as some of our prisons. They are not fit places for children; without means of intellectual, moral or religious instruction, or for the peculiar care needed by children, especially children within the age of nurture. And it is manifestly better for poor children that they should be supported in some other asylum, where they may have fitting culture and better care; where some person or body may stand to them in loco pa\/rcntis, and measurably discharge towards them the parental duties of nurture and education.\nIf poor houses, certainly common jails and penitentiaries are unfit places for the confinement of children; even of ordinarily vicious children. In these it cannot be said that children are altogether without opportunities of education; but it is vicious education. All experience has shown the. tendency of prisons for crime, to aggravate tire depravity of less gnilty adult prisoners. Tire association with practiced criminals generally to be found in such places, which is almost necessary to confinement within them, must inevitably expose children to corrupting influences, which few children have character to resist. And when children must be confined for crime, common humanity to them, common regard for the future welfare of the state, requires, in many cases, that they should be sent to some place of detention more appropriate for them, where they may have a reasonable opportunity of becoming better, instead of worse, by their confinement; where the prison authorities are not their mere jailers, but are charged with parental duty as well as with parental authority; and where education for good is not only not excluded, but is made a condition of their restraint.\nSuch were doubtless the views of the legislature in passing ch. 325 of 1875 and ch. 142 of 187'6. The latter act makes it the duty of the poor authorities throughout the state, to place healthy children as paupers, not in poor houses, but in families, orphan asylums or other appropriate institutions. The former act had already authorized the incorporation of industrial schools in every county, for the care and support of destitute children, and for the confinement of children convicted of crime. There might be constitutional difficulties or defects, in general or special provisions, in statutes of this character; but we think that even Judge Redfield would readily have recognized, not only their humanity, but their propriety, as reforms strictly within a proper legislative function, and not a meddlesome interference with private discretion or discipline. And we cannot forbear the remark that the general scope of these statutes, whatever defects there may be in their details, reflects honor upon the legislative bodies which passed them, and upon the state.\nNotwithstanding this prepossession in favor of the statute before us, it is our duty to test all its provisions involved in this case, by the letter and spirit of the constitution, and to hold the restraints and principles of that instrument sacred, as against any provision of any act of the legislature, however humane or benevolent.\nSections 1, 2, 3 and 9 provide for the incorporation and organization of industrial schools. Section 4 subjects the corporations to the same visitation and inspection of the state board of charities and reform as other state charitable and penal institutions.\nSection 5 authorizes courts and officers having criminal jurisdiction, judges of courts of record and mayors of cities, to cause to be brought before them children between the ages and of the classes prescribed by the section.\nThe power conferred is clearly judicial, and cannot be exercised by mayors of cities (Attorney General v. McDonald, 3 Wis., 805); probably not by judges of courts of record at chambers. Re Kindling, 39 Wis., 35. Any defect of jurisdiction in them, however, could not affect the authority conferred on courts.\nThe provisions of the section include any male child under twelve, and female child under sixteen years of age, coming within either of these conditions: \u201c That is begging or receiving alms, whether actually or under pretense of selling or offering for sale anything, or being in any public street or place for the purpose of begging or receiving alms; or that is found wandering and not having any home or settled place of abode, proper guardianship or means of subsistence; or is found destitute either by being an orphan or having a parent or parents who is undergoing imprisonment or otherwise; or that frequents the company of reputed thieves, or of lewd, wanton or lascivious persons in speech or behavior, or notorious resorts of bad characters; or that is found wandering in streets, alleys or public places, and belonging to that class of children called ragpickers;\u2019 or that is an inmate of any house of ill fame or poor house, whether in comjiany with its parent or parents or otherwise; or who has been abandoned in any way by his parent or parents or guardians; or who is without means of subsistence or support.\u201d\nThere is diversity of conditions in these several classifications, and some of them were severely criticised on the argument, and may perhaps be open to criticism. In this case, we have only to do with the provision relating to inmates of poor houses. And, without indicating any opinion as to the other classes of children embraced in the section, it is sufficient to say here, that the provisions of the statute,, as they affect each class of children, are independent. The statute might be inoperative as to one class or classes, and valid as to other class or classes. Lynch v. The Economy, 27 Wis., 69.\nCourts and officers before whom a child within the conditions of the section may be brought, \u201c if satisfied on inquiry of the fact, and that the welfare of such child will bo promoted thereby, may order such child to be sent to an industrial school in his own county, if there be one, and if not, to one in another county; and may direct such child to be kept and maintained in such school, at the expense of the county, until twenty-one years of age, or earlier discharged, as provided later in the act.\u201d The rest of the section makes similar provision for sending children convicted of crime to such schools.\nIt seemed to be assumed on the argument, that the power of courts to send children to these schools under either branch of the provision, was peremptory. But we think that it rests clearly in discretion, controlled by the welfare of the child. And we should have been inclined to hold the term of commitment, during minority, to be also discretionary (Cutler v. Howard, 9 Wis., 309; Market Bank v. Hogan, 21 id., 317; Dutcher v. Dutcher, 39 id., 651), if the language of this section had not been controlled by the provision in sec. 7, that all sentences and commitments shall be until majority.\nSec. 6 authorizes industrial schools to receive children so sent to them, and thereupon to take exclusive custody, care and guardianship of such children, until discharged therefrom. The rest of the section is confined to provisions authorizing children to be sent to these schools, under certain conditions, by authority of their parents; provisions not involved in the consideration of this case. Sec. 7 authorizes the officers of the schools to discharge children sent to them by judicial authority, before majority, when in their judgment it shall be for the interest of the children. Sec. 8 gives authority to the officers of the schools to detain children sent to them by judicial authority; malees provision for the proper education of the children in the schools,- and gives discretion to the officers to bind out the children as apprentices, or to give them to suitable persons for adoption during minority.\nIt was strongly objected to the statute, that it authorizes the same disposition of children destitute by misfortune, and of children convicted of crime; committing them alike to these schools, during minority, there to associate together. It must be remembered, however, that this evil, if evil it be, is subject to judicial discretion, and that in sentencing criminal children courts will not overlook the discretion to confine them in ordinary prisons or in these schools, or the degree of depravity of convicted children, or the liability of destitute children in these schools to be demoralized by association. Children guilty of crime are not always, perhaps not often, so depraved as to make their presence in such schools dangerous to their associates. The state, providing for children dependent upon it, whether from indigence or crime, has an essential discretion in the manner of doing so. And it appears to have been in the mind of the legislature, that children guilty of accidental offenses might be more sure to gain than children destitute by misfortune would be to lose by the association, under the careful discipline provided by the act, subject to the supervision of the state board of charities and reform. Rut, if the objection were as grave as represented, it would be a defect of detail only, not of power; a blemish, not surprising in the in .fancy of so benign a reform, and readily to be obviated in time by amendment of tbe statute.\nSuch commitments of destitute children were stigmatized as tlie punishment of poverty as a crime. We have already sufficiently expressed our opinion that the removal of children from poor houses to these schools is mercy, not punishment.\nSuch commitments of poor children were denounced as an arbitrary interference with the natural affections and relations of parent and child; as an arbitrary invasion of natural and inalienable rights of both parent and child. As will be presently seen, we cannot consider the statute as authorizing the separation of parent and child, when the parent is able and willing to perform his duty to the child. And when a parent is unable or unwilling to provide for his child, and leaves the child dependent on the charity of the state, we are at a loss to comprehend the right of the parent to object to the form which the state gives to its charity, with intelligent regard for the welfare of the child. And, as regards the right of the child infringed by such considerate benevolence exercised towards it by the state, on which misfortune has made it dependent, we can only say that we have little consideration for the inalienable right of idleness, ignorance and vice, or for the care or want of care which fosters it.\nThe gravest objection, however, made to the statute is, that the commitment of a child to one of these schools until majority, except for crime, operates as an imprisonment of the child for that period, without due process of law, and that the statute authorizing it is therefore a positive violation of the constitution. We will consider this objection separately, as it affects the right of the child, and as it affects the right of the parent.\nAnd, in the first place, we cannot understand that the detention of the child at one of these schools should be considered as imprisonment, any more than its detention in the poor house; any more than the detention of any child at any board ing school, standing, for tbe time, im, looo parentis to tbe child. Parental authority implies restraint, not imprisonment. ' And every school must necessarily exercise some measure of the parental power of restraint over children committed to it. And when the state, as pa\/rens patriae, is compelled by the misfortune of a child to assume for it parental duty,, and to charge itself with its nurture, it is compelled also to assume parental authority over it. This authority must necessarily be delegated to those to whom the state delegates the nurture and education of the child. The state does not, indeed we might say could not, intrude this assumption of authority between parent and child standing in no need of it. It assumes it only upon the destitution and necessity of the child, arising from want or default of parents. And, in exercising a wholesome parental restraint over the child, it can be properly said to imprison the child, no more than the tenderest parent exercising like power of restraint over children. This seems too plain to need authority; but the cases cited for the respondent, and others, amply sustain our view.\nIn the second place, the statute, certainly so far as it is involved here, does not go on failure in the measure of support or education by the parent, on some nice fault-finding with the course of the parent with the child, as the court appeared to think that the Illinois statute did, in People v. Turner, 55 Ill., 280. It goes on the total failure of the parent to provide for the child. And it is difficult to comprehend the right of a parent to complain, that the discharge by the state of his own duty to his child, which he has wholly failed to perform, is an imprisonment of the child as against his parental right in it.\nIt was argued, however, that the disability of a parent to support his child might well be accidental or temporary, and that the commitment until majority would operate as an imprisonment of the child, as against both parent and child, in pases where the parent should afterward be able and willing to resume the nurture and- education of the child. This objection would have great weight, if it would not be fatal to the validity of the statute, were it well founded. \"We cotdd not think it removed by the discretionary authority of the officers of these schools, to discharge the child in such a case. We are of course not now speaking of commitments for crime, but only of commitments for the causes which may be classed as misfortune. In the latter case, we should be very reluctant to hold the power of the state to survive the disability or default of the parent. And the right of the parent to resume the care of his child, in proper circumstances, should not be dependent on the discretion of the school officers.\nBut we cannot consider the statute, in its true construction, open to the objection. We cannot think that it was intended to foreclose the right of a parent, when competent, to resume the custody and care of his child. In this respect, there is a significant difference between it and the statute before the court in People v. Turner. That statute provided for process against the parent or guardian of the child; making them parties to the proceeding and apparently bound by it. The statute before us carefully avoids that difficulty; and operates, so to speak, upon the child in personam, without citing the parent or guardian, without any color of intent to bind the parent or guardian by the proceeding or by the commitment. It appears to us quite obvious, upon familiar principles, that the parent or guardian is not precluded by the commitment from asserting any right to the custody and care of the child, which he may be afterwards able to establish. When a parent or other proper guardian should be able to show that the disability or default on which the child\u2019s commitment proceeded was accidental or temporary, and no longer exists, and that he is, in the language of sec. 5, ch. 112, E. S., not otherwise unsuitable for the custody of the child, his right to the custody should prevail over the commitment to which he was not a party. In such a case, if the officers of a school should re fuse to surrender a child, no court would hesitate to restore the child to the care of the parent or guardian. The commitment during minority binds the child only; not the parent or guardian, when competent to fulfill towards the child the duties assumed by the state. It is conclusive as between the school and the child; but not as between the school and the parent or guardian. The statute is a humane one, and should not be bent to a construction inconsistent with one of the dearest rights of humanity. It is our duty to give it a construction, if we can, to give it effect. And we find no difficulty in giving it this construction, which seems to us to have been in the mind of the legislature when it was framed.\nWe have already given reasons for calling the statute humane; but there is another worthy of notice, as showing the considerate and benevolent spirit in which it was framed. Women alone, or women and men, but not men alone, may incorporate themselves under the statute. Thus no industrial school can be without the sex which is by nature best qualified for the nurture of children. Such chai-ities are best committed to women, in whole or in part. And in such lies the truest and noblest scope for the public activities of women, in the time which they can spare from their primary domestic duties. Such a statute, so framed and so guarded, is not an arbitrary assumption of meddlesome authority, outside of the scope of the proper function of legislation; but is evidence that public charity is here losing the offensive and oppressive character sometimes attributed to it.\nThe case of People v. Turner appears to turn on the question of compulsory education, a very different question from that here. We are not prepared to say that we might not decide a similar case, under a similar statute, in the same way. But there is much said in the opinion inconsistent with some of the views which we have expressed, to which we could not assent, and which has failed to change our views of this case. We were greatly interested in the note appended to that case, and to which we were specially referred (10 Am. Law. Reg., N. S., 372,) by that great jurist and gifted man, the late Chief Justice Redfield. But it appears to us that, though his approval of the decision is unqualified, his approval of the opinion is less so. The burden of his comments is against meddlesome legislative interference in private relations and private duties, under the name of reform; against theories tending greatly or wholly to substitute the authority of the state, as parens patries, for parental authority and domestic discipline. With much that he says on this topic, we might cordially agree.. And we think that none of the views which he expresses are in conflict with ours of this case. Some of his views struck us so forcibly as to lead us into the remarks made in the opening of this opinion. There is, in his suggestions, instruction to all courts to distinguish, as we trust we have distinguished in this case, between the proper scope of legislative authority, and mischievous meddling by statute with matters of purely private concern, and especially with the natural and sacred relation of parent and child.\nIt is so apparent to us that this statute does not go to dis-tixrb the uniformty of county government, that we do not think it necessary to discuss it. We did not understand counsel as seriously relying upon the point.\nBy the Court. \u2014 The judgment of the court below is affirmed."},{"case_name":"GRANVILLE H. LINCOLN and GEORGE S.

The appointment of a guardian, the control, management, and sale of the wards\u2019 estate, are duties pertaining to the judicial and not to the legis lative branch of the Government. They are duties which had been, and were at the time of the attempted sale under the act in question, vested in the Courts, and generally, this power was one belonging to the judicial branch of the Government. (Poty v. Smith, April Term, 1874; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 1333-4; Andrews' Case, 1 Johns. Ch. 99; Cooley\u2019s Const. Lira. 87, and cases cited; Adams\u2019 Eq. 284.)\nW. II. Patterson, for Respondent, cited Brenham v Davidson, 51 Cal. 352.\nBy the COURT:\nIn Brenham v. Davidson, 51 Cal. 352, the statute which was under review in that case conferred the power of sale on the guardian of the minor, and the sale was to be approved by the Probate Court. The proceeds of the sale were to be reinvested for the benefit of the minor; and, moreover, no sale was to be made unless the mother of- the minor, who held an undivided interest in the property, united in the sale and conveyance. Under these circumstances we held that the case was one not provided for by the general law regulating the sale of the estates of minors, and that in passing the statute the Legislature did not attempt to exercise judicial powers; but that as parens patriae, it has the power by special act, in a case not provided for by the general law, to authorize the real estate of the minor to be converted into money by his guardian, if the Probate Court approves the sale. But in the case at bar the minors had a duly qualified and acting statutory guardian at the time of the passage of the special act, and the general law provided an appropriate method by which the Probate Court could order a sale of the real estate of the minors by the guardian, if a sale was necessary for their education and support. The special act conferred the power of sale, not upon the guardian, but upon the mother of the' minors, who was not their guardian and had no interest in the property. Ror were any conditions imposed upon her, except that she should first execute a bond, to be approved by the Probate Judge, conditioned that the proceeds of the sale should be appropriated to the support and education of the minors, and that the sale should not be valid unless confirmed by the Probate Court previous to the execution of the deed.\nIn treating of the rights and powers of - statutory guardians of the estates of minors, Mr. Schouler, in his treatise on Domestic Eelations, (p. 471) says: \u201c The recognized principle is that such guardians have an authority coupled with an interest, not a bare authority \u201d; and such we understand to be the well-settled rule. The statute under consideration attempts to take the estate of the minors out of the hands of their guardian, and to withdraw it from the control of the Probate Court, which, under the general law, had ample authority to order it to be sold and the proceeds to be applied to the support and education of the minors. It wholly ignores the rights and powers of the guardian, who had an authority coupled with an interest\u2014withdraws the estate from the jurisdiction and control of the Probate Court, which that Court might rightfully exercise under the general law\u2014and attempts to substitute another person for the guardian, with authority to dispose of the estate absolutely, on no other conditions than those already mentioned, bio adjudicated case has been called to our attention, in which the exercise of such a power by the Legislature has been upheld. In his work on Constitutional Limitations, at page 98, Judge Cooley, in discussing legislation of this character, says : \u201c The rule upon this subject, as we deduce it from the authorities, seems to be this: If the party standing in the position of trustee applies for permission to make the sale, for a purpose apparently for the interest of the cestui que trust, and there are no adverse interests to be considered and adjudicated, the case is not one which requires judicial action; but it is optional with the Legislature to grant the writ by statute, or to refer the case to the Courts for consideration, according as the one course or the other, on considerations of policy, may seem desirable.\u201d But in the present case it does not appear that the application was made by a party \u201cstanding in the position of trustee,\u201d and there were \u201c adverse interests to be considered and adjudicated,\u201d to wit, those of the guardian.\nUpon the face of the act there is nothing to show that the Legislature was informed that a general guardian of the estates of these infants had actually been appointed. It is fairly to be presumed that they were ignorant of that fact. At all events, in view of the facts now found by the Court below, the act cannot be permitted to operate, since, under the circumstances, it would be judicial and not legislative in its character, and for that reason unconstitutional.\nJudgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial."},{"case_name":"Rock Hill College vs. Thomas Jones, and others, Administrators, and the Board of County School Commissioners of Howard County","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1819076\/","date":"1877-06-14","court":"Court of Appeals of Maryland","content":"Alvey, J.,\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nThe Rock Hill College, the appellant in this case, was incorporated by the Act of 1865, ch. 10, and, by the admission of the demurrer to the bill of complaint, is the only college located in Howard County. James Stratton died in that county in July, 1875, intestate, possessed of a considerable personal estate, and without leaving a widow or children, or descendants of children, or other relations within the fifth degree, reckoned by counting down from the common ancestor. There has been an administration upon the estate of the intestate, and there remains a con siderable surplus of such estate, after the payment of debts, funeral charges, and expenses of administration. This surplus is claimed by the appellant, and the object of the present bill is the assertion of that claim as against the claim to the fund set up by the Board of County School Commissioners of Howard County, under the general Act of 1876, ch. 295, and the special Act of the same session, chapter 377.\nThe foundation of the appellant\u2019s claim is the 136th section of Art. 93, of the Code, as that section stood before its repeal and re-enactment by the Act or 1876, ch. 295, to which we have just referred. That section, as it stood before the repeal, provided that \u201cIf there be no widow or relations of the intestate within the fifth degree, which shall be reckoned by counting down from the common ancestor to the more remote, the whole surplus shall belong' to the State, and shall be paid to the college, if any, in the county where the deceased shall die, or if none, to any school in the county to which the public aid by law may be extended, and if none, to the county where the property of the intestate shall lie.\u201d This section was codified from the provisions of the Acts of 1798, ch. 101, suh ch. 11, sec. 15, and 1802, ch. 101,. sec. 11. In the first of these Acts it was provided, that \u201cthe whole surplus shall belong to the State, to be applied as the Legislature shall hereafter direct, saving to the different schools in this State the rights which, by existing laws, they now respectively possess.\u201d While this statute fully recognized the rights that had been acquired by the schools, it was soon after modified by another, that of 1802, ch. 101, sec. 11, whereby, instead of allowing the fund to remain undisposed of as under the Act of 1798, where there was no schools in the county, it was provided, that in all instances where by law the property of deceased persons would have descended or devolved on the free school of any county, if such free school had existed, the same should be and was thereby declared to be, the property of tbe college, if any, in such county, or if none, the property of any school to which the public aid by law had been or might be extended, and if none, to go to tbe county where tbe property of such person or persons so dying might lie ; and that the trustees of the college or school, or the justice of the levy Court, respectively, as the case might be, should bave tbe same right, powers and authority, to sue for and recover snob property, as the visitors, trustees or governors, of any such free school might or could have done.\nThe Act of 1876, ch. 295, as we have already said, repealed the 136th section of Art. 93 of the Code, and re-enacted the same in the terms of the section as it originally stood in the Code, except that, instead of the direction that the surplus should belong to the State, and should he paid to the college, if any, in the county, or if none, to any school, etc., the re-enacted section provides that \u201c the whole surplus shall belong to the State, and shall be paid to the Board of County School Commissioners of the county wherein letters of administration shall be granted upon the estate of the deceased, for the use of the public schools of said county.\u201d There is nothing in the section thus enacted that looks to its operation upon past cases; and it would appear that the Legislature supposed the change in the law by the repeal and re-enactment of this section of the Code would not retroact and control this case; for among the laws of the same session we find the special Act, chapter 377, wherein, after reciting the facts of the case, it is enacted that the administrators of the deceased, after the passage of their final account, \u201cshall pay over the whole surplus of said estate to the Board of County School Commissioners of Howard County;\u201d provided, no relation of the intestate, within the fifth degree, shall appear and claim, &c.\nRelying upon these Acts of 1876, the appellees demurred to the bill of complaint filed by the appellant; and the question is, was the right of the latter to receive the fund, under the Code, Art. 93, sec. 136, of a nature and character to be subject to the control of the Legislature, and the fund liable to be diverted from the objects and purposes declared in the law which was in force at the death of the intestate? This question was resolved in the affirmative by the Court below, and we are now required to review that decision.\nThe appellant contends that the 136th sect, of Art. 93 of the Code was part of the law of distribution, and that, by force of that law, the right and title to the fund vested in the appellant, through the State as mere trustee, eo instanti the death of the intestate; and the right being vested, it could not be divested and the fund appropriated to other objects and uses, by subsequent legislation. While, on the other hand, it is contended by the appellees, that the operation of the 136th section referred to was simply an appropriation of revenue, derived by the State from the estates of persons dying intestate, and without relations within a certain degree, and that it was competent to the Legislature to revoke such appropriation at any time before the fund was actually paid over by the administrators. 1\nWithout reference to any question as to whether the general Act of 18*76, ch. 295, could be fairly so construed as to have a retroactive effect, or whether it was competent to the Legislature to pass the special Act of 1876, ch. 377, under the 33rd section of the 3rd Article of the Constitution, which provides that the G-eneral Assembly shall pass no special law, for any case, for which provision has been made by an existing general law, the right -here involved, according to the contention of the-parties, depends upon the question, whether the State held an absolute, disposable right in the fund, at and from the time of the death of the intestate, irrespective of the imperative provision that such fund should be paid over to the college ?\nThat the State has any original prerogative right to appropriate the fund to its own use, in the absence of statutory rules of distribution, is a proposition that cannot be maintained. In England, even in the ancient period of her jurisprudence, when power was arbitrary and the rights of the subject but ill-defined, such prerogative was not claimed. It is true, that, in early times, \u201cwhen a man died intestate, and had made no disposition of his goods, nor committed his trust to any, in such case the King, who was parens patriae, and had the supreme care to provide for all his subjects, that every one should enjoy that which he ought to have, used by his ministers to seize the goods of the intestate, to the intent they should be preserved and disposed for the burial of the deceased, for payment of his debts, to advance his wife and children, if he had any, and if not, those of his blood.\u201d Hensloe\u2019s Case, 9 Co., 38 b. Therefore, the holding by the King was a mere trust. Afterwards this care and trust was committed to ordinaries, until finally, to correct the abuses of their administration, the subject was regulated by statute. 1 Wms. on Ex\u2019rs, 330. But here with us, the power of the State over the subject-matter has been and is the law-making power, and that alone, whereby general rules and regulations are prescribed for the government of the people and the disposition of their property. These general rules prescribed by the Legislature, all persons are supposed to be aware of, and to act in reference to them. Rights that pass and become vested under the existing law of the land are supposed to be beyond the control of the State through its Legislature. The mere change of the law does not divest or impair the rights of property acquired before the change, even though the Legislature may intend the new law so to operate. \u201cA law,\u201d says Puffendorff, \u2018 can be repealed by the law-giver ; but the rights which have been acquired under it while it was in force, do not thereby cease. It would be an act of absolute injustice, to abolish with alaw all the effects which it had produced.\u201d L. Nat. and n., Bk. 1, ch. 6, secs. 6 and 7. This is a principle of general jurisprudence ; but a right to be within its protection must be a vested right. It must be something more than a mere expectation based upon an anticipated continuance of the existing law. \u201c'It must have become a title, legal or equitable\/to the present or future enjoyment of property, or to the present or future enforcement of a demand, or a legal exemption from a demand made by another.\u201d Cooley, Const. Lim., 359. And as said by Mr. Justice Woodberry, in Merrill vs. Sherburne, 1 N. H., 213, Acts of the Legislature will not be regarded as violating fundamenlal axioms of legislation, \u201c unless they impair rights which are vested ; because most civil lights are derived from public laws: and if, before the rights become vested in particular individuals, the convenience of the State procures amendments or repeals of those laws, those individuals have no cause of complaint.\u201d But where rights, not of a penal nature, nor such as merely relate to remedies, have become vested, such rights are considered as being beyond the power of the Legislature to divest them. 1 Kent Com., 455 ; 2 Sto. on Const., sec. 1399. This principle is of the utmost importance, and no Court in the country has been more emphatic than this in giving sanction to it, and denying validity to legislation which sought, by retroactive operation, to divest rights of property which had become vested before such legislation occurred. This has been decided upon several occasions ; and as cases germane to the present, where such legislation was denied effect, we may refer to those of Wilderman vs. The Mayor & City Council of Balto., 8 Md., 551, and State, use of Trustees vs Warren, 28 Md., 338.\nNow, with these well established principles in mind, let us see what are the terms of the statute under which the appellant claims. The terms, material to the question here involved, are, that \u201c the whole surplus shall belong to the State, and shall be paid to the college, if any, in the county where the deceased shall die.\u201d It will be observed that the language which declares to whom the fund shall be paid is equally positive and unequivocal as that which declares that the fund shall belong to the State. If, therefore, the terms employed vested a legal right in the State, it would seem to be equally clear that the terms which follow vested the equitable and beneficial right in the college. If the statute had simply declared that the fund should be paid over to the college, without the intervention of the State, we suppose it would not be contended for a moment that the Legislature could, by an Act subsequent to the death of the intestate, divert the fund, and either turn it into the State treasury, or apply it to other objects. Or if, instead of declaring that the fund should belong to the State to be paid to the college, it had declared that the fund should belong to some third party, other than the State, to be paid over to the college, it would present a case equally free from legislative interference and control. And if all disposable right of the State would be excluded in the cases supposed, we do not perceive why it should be thought that the State held an absolute disposable right to the fund in the case as it actually exists. The State is only a medium, a mere trustee, with a full and explicit declaration of trust, made by authority of the trustee itself; and in such case, as between individuals, it would be perfectly clear, that, not only would the relation of trustee and cestui que trust exist, but a perfect title in equity be created, which Courts of equity would enforce; for it is now well settled that if a person effectually declares himself to be trustee for another of money or property to be recovered, such declaration will be binding against him and his representatives. Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves., 149; Dipple vs. Corles, 11 Hare, 183; Peckham vs. Taylor, 31 Beav., 250. We do not say, how ever, that such would he the effect of a gratuitous appropriation by the State of its own revenue. In such case, it may well be that the Legislature could withdraw the appropriation hy a repealing Act at any time before the money was actually paid over. But if the fund here in question did not belong to the State, and form a part of its disposable reveuue, the principle upon which such an appropriation may he revoked can have no application to this case. And by way of further test of the question, whether the fund in controversy was at the absolute disposal of the State, let us suppose that, instead of declaring that the fund should belong to the State, to he paid over to the college, the statute had declared that the fund should belong to the State, and should be paid over to the relations of the deceased beyond the fifth degree ; or, to put the case still stronger, that the fund should belong to the State to be paid to the relations of the intestate within the fifth degree : would any one contend that the State could lawfully ignore the claims of the relations of the deceased, and appropriate the fund to other objects at pleasure, upon the theory that the fund had devolved upon the State absolutely, and that the explicit direction to pay over to the relations of the deceased formed no part of the law of distribution, and conferred no rights that the Legislature was hound to respect ? Such proposition, we suppose, would not be attempted to be maintained ; and if not, upon what principle is it that the provisions of the statute requiring the fund to he paid over to the college, can be revoked and utterly disregarded ? The matter of distribution of an intestate\u2019s personal estate is regulated by positive law, and any person within the rules prescribed acquires a right' of which he cannot be divested by a retroactive law. The Legislature has thought proper, in prescribing the rules of distribution, to exclude all the relations of the intestate beyond the fifth degree, and to substitute colleges and schools as the recipients of the sur plus of tlie intestate\u2019s personal estate. But we are not aware that such distributions have ever been regarded as mere donations from the funds of the State. On the contrary, such distributions have been made either to the State for the use of the schools, or to the schools and colleges directly without the intervention of the State ; but the rights of such schools and colleges have been supposed to be founded upon the positive law of distribution ; and upon that theory funds so distributable have been sued for and recovered directly by the institutions entitled. Charlotte Hall School vs. Greenwell, 4 Gill & J., 407 ; and Thomas vs. Visitors of Frederick County School, 7 Gill & John., 369. Suits could not have been maintained upon any other than vested rights of action ; and therefore the Court must have assumed, and did assume, and affirmed, that there was a vested right in the fund sued for.\nBut it is contended in this case, that though the Legislature may have no power to pass laws to divest vested rights of property, yet, under the terms of the statute, no right to the surplus could vest until the surplus was ascertained and ready to be paid over; and until that time it was competent to the Legislature to repeal the law in force at the time of the death of the intestate, and prescribe a new rule for the distribution of his estate, and according to which the fund would pass and should be paid over by the administrators. But to this we cannot accede. While the fund was not receivable by the college until after administration and the surplus ascertained, the right vested from the death of the intestate; and it was the right of the college to insist upon a faithful administration of the intestate, and to require an account in order to determine the real surplus to which it was entitled. 7 Gill & John., 369 ; see also 8 Md., 551, and 28 Md., 338.\nThe principle contended for by the appellees is not only wrong as it would effect the rights of the college, but it is wrong as it might, by possibility at least, operate to defeat the deliberate purpose of an intestate. Without at all intimating that the intention of the intestate in the present instance would be defeated, yet,, all persons, capable of making their wills, have a perfect right to dispose of their estates at pleasure, and they do dispose of them by allowing them to pass after their death, according to the then existing law of the land, with which they are' supposed to have been acquainted. They are supposed to have known and understood the consequences of dying intestate ; and their intestacy, to use the language of Chief Justice Gibson, in Norman vs. Heist, 5 Watts & Sergt., 171, may often be \u201cperhaps less the effect of accident than design.\u201d At any rate, the Legislature is not warranted in any particular case in assuming that the intestacy of a party was purely accidental; and thence proceed to direct the disposition of his estate to objects different from those prescribed by the law existing at the time of his death.\n(Decided June 14th, 1877.)\nIt follows that the Act of 1876, ch. 295, repealing and re-enacting the 186th section of Art. 93 of the Code, is without .effect so far as this case is concerned ; and that the special Act of 1876, ch. 337, was passed without competent authority to give it effect, and that 'it is, therefore, .a nullity.\nThe order appealed from, sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill, must be reversed, and the demurrer be overruled ; and the cause will be remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\nDecree reversed, and cause remanded."},{"case_name":"Ould v.

The plaintiffs thereupon sued out this writ of error. The questions presented for our consideration are questions of law arising upon the will of Joshua Pierce, deceased. The will declares: \u2014\n\u201cI give, devise, and bequeath all those fourteen certain lots\u201d (describing fully the premises in controversy) \u201cto my friends, William M. Shuster and William H. Clagett, of the said city of Washington, and the survivor of them, and the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of such survivor, in trust, nevertheless, and to and for and upon the uses, intents, and purposes following, that is to say: In trust to hold the said fourteen lots of ground, with the appurtenances, as and for a site for the erection of a hospital for foundlings, to be built and erected by any association, society, or institution that may hereafter be incorporated by an act of Congress as and for such hospital, and upon such incorporation, upon further trust to grant and convey the- said lots of ground and trust-estate to the corporation or institution so incorporated for said purpose of the erection of a hospital, which conveyance shall be absolute' and in fee: Provided, nevertheless, that such corporation shall be approved by my said trustees, or the survivor of them, or their successors in the trust ; and, if not so approved, then upon further trust to hold the said lots and trust-estate for the same purpose, until a corporation shall be so created by act'of Congress which shall meet the approval of the said trustees or.the survivor or successors of them, to whom full discretion is given in this behalf; and, upon such approval, in trust to convey as aforesaid; and I recommend to my said trustees, to select an institution which shall not be under the control of any one religious sect or persuasion ; and, until such conveyance, I direct the taxes, charges, and assessrfaents, and all necessary expenses of, for, and upon said lots, and every one of them, to be paid by my executors, as they shall from tipie to time accrue and become due and payable, out of the residue of my estate.\u201d\nThe will was duly proved and admitted to probate in the proper court in the District of Columbia, on the 22d of June, 1864. On the 22d of April, 1870, Congress passed \u201c An Act for incorporating a hospital for foundlings in the city of Washington.\u201d 16 Stat. 92. On the 4th of April, 1872, Shuster and Clagett, the trustees, conveyed the property to the defendant in error, the Washington Hospital for Foundlings, so incorporated, pursuant to the directions of the will.\nThe Statute of Wills of Maryland of 1798, which is still in force in the District of Columbia, provides that \u201c no will, testament, or codicil shall be effectual to create any .interest or perpetuity, or make,any, lim\u00edfei\u00edo&\u00e9.cnr appoint to any uses not now permitted by the Constitution or laws of the State.\u201d 2 Kilty\u2019s Laws of Md., c. 101.\nOur attention Has been called in this connection to nothing in the Constitution, and to nothing else in the laws of the State, as requiring consideration. No statute of mortmain or statute like that of 9 Geo. II., c. 36,' is an element in the case.\nThe statute of 43 Eliz., c. 4, was never in force, in Maryland. Dashiell v. Attorney-General, 5 Har. & J. (Md.) 392. It is not, therefore, operative in the District of Columbia.\nThe opinion prevailed extensively in this country for a considerable period that the validity of charitable endowments and the jurisdiction of courts of equity in such cases depended upon that statute. These views were assailed with very great learning and ability in 1833, by Mr. Justice Baldwin, in McGrill v. Brown. Bright. (Pa.) 346. An eminent counsel of New York was the pioneer of the bar in 1835 in a like attack. His argument in Burr\u2019s Executors v. Smith, 7 Vt. 241, was elaborate and brilliant, and, as the authorities then were, exhaustive. He was followed in support of. the same view, in 1844, by another counsel no less eminent, in Vidal v. Philadelphia, 2 How. 128. The publication, then recent, of the Reports of the British Records Commission, enabled the\" latter gentleman -to throw much additional and valuable light into the discussion; The argument was onclusive.\nIn delivering the opinion of the court, Mr. Justice Story, referring to the doctrine thus combated, said, \u201c Whatever doubts might, therefore, properly be entertained upon the subject when the-case of the Trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association, was before the court (1819), those doubts are entirely removed by the later and more satisfactory sources of information to which we- have alluded.\u201d -'\nThe former idea was exploded, and has since nearly disappeared from the jurisprudence of the country.\nUpon reading the statute carefully, one- fiannot but feel surprised that the doubts thus indicated ever existed. The statute is purely remedial and ancillary. It provided for a commission to examine into the abuses of charities already existing, and to correct such abuses. An- appeal lay to the Lord Chancellor. The statute was silent as to the creation or inhibition of any new charity, and n neither increased nor diminished the preexisting jurisdiction in equity touching the subject. The object of the statute was to create a cheaper and-a speedier remedy for existing.abuses. The Morpeth Corporation, Duke on Charitable Uses, 242. In the course of time, the new remedy fell into entire disuse, and the control of the chancellor became' again practically sole and exclusive.- The power of the king as parens patriae, acting through the chancellor, and the powers of the latter independently of the king, are subjects that need not here be considered. Fountain v. Ravennel, 17 How. 379; 2 Story, Eq. Jur., sect. 1190,\nThe learning developed in the three cases mentioned shows clearly that the law as to such uses, and the jurisdiction of the chancellor, and the extent to which it was exercised, before and after the enactment of the statute, were just the same.\nIt is, therefore, quite immaterial in the present ease whether the statute was or was not a part of the law of Maryland. The controversy must be determined upon the general principles of jurisprudence, and the presence or absence of the statute cannot affect the result.\nTwo objections were urged upon our attention in the argument at bar.\nThat there is no specification of the foundlings to be provided for, and that therefore the devise is void for uncertainty.\nIn this connection, it was suggested by one of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs in error that a hospital for foundlings tends to evil, and ought not to be supported.\nThat the devise is void because it \u00e9reates a perpetuity.\nThe Statute of Elizabeth, before referred to, names twenty-one distinct- charities. They are \u2014\n1. For relief of aged, impotent, and poor people. 2. For maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers. 3. Schools of learning. 4. Free schools. 5. Scholars in universities. ..6. Houses of correction. 7. For repair of bridges; 8, of ports afid-havens; 9, of causeways ; 10, of churches'; 11,..-of sea-banks ; 12, of highways. 13.- For education and preferment of orphans. 14. For .marriage of poor maids. T5. For support and help of young tradesmen; 16, of handicraftsmen; 17, of persons decayed. 18. For redemption or relief of prisoners or captives. 19. Formase and aid of poor inhabitants concerning payment of fifteens. 20. Setting out of soldiers; 21, and other taxes.\nUpon examining the early English-statutes and .the. early decisions of the courts of law and. equity, Mr. Justi ce Baldwin found forty-six specifications of pious and charitable uses recognized as within, the protection of the law, in which were embraced all that were enumerated in the statute of Elizabeth. McGill v. Brown, supra. It is deemed unnecessary to extend the enumeration beyond, those already named.\nA charitable use, where neither law nor public policy forbids, may be applied to almost any thing that tends to promote the well-doing and well-being of social man. Perry on Trusts, sect. 687.\nIn the Girard Will Case, the Jeading counseL for the will thus defined charity: \u201c Whatever is given for the. love of God, or the love of your neighbor, in the catholic and universal-sense,- \u2014 given from-these motives and to these er ds, free from the stain or taint of every consideration that is personal, private, or selfish.\u201d Mr. Binney\u2019s Argument, p. 41.\nThe objection of uncertainty in .this case as to the particular foundlings to be received is without force. The endowment of hospitals for the afflicted and destitute of particular classes, or without any specification of class, is one of the commonest forms of such uses. The hospital being in' jorporated, nothing beyond its designation as the donee is neci ,ssary. Who shall be received, with all other' details of manag sment, may well- be committed to those to whom its adminislration is intrusted.. This point is so clear, that discussion or the citation of authorities is unnecessary. \"Cases illustrating the subject in this view are largely referred to in Perry on Trusts, f.ect. 699, and in the note to sect. 1164, Story, Eq. J.ur. See riso id., sects. 1164, 1190, and notes.\nHospitals for foundlings existed in the B ornan Empire,- They increased, when Christianity triumphed, They exist in all countries. oi Europe, and they exist in -this country. There are no -beneficiaries more needing protection, care, and kind ness, none more blameless, and there are none who have stronger claims than these waifs, helpless and abandoned upon the sea of life.\nA' perpetuity is a limitation of property which renders it inalienable beyond the period allowed by law. That period is \u00e1 life or lives in being and twenty-one years more, with a fraction of a year added for the term of gestation, in cases of posthumous birth.\nIn this case, the devise was in fee to two trustees and to the survivor of them. They were directed to convey the premises to an eleemosynary corporation for foundlings, whenever Congress should create one which the trustees approved. If the will had b^en so drawn as itself to work the devolution of the title upon the happening of ,the event named, the clause would have been an executory devise. ' \u2019If the same thing had been provided for in a deed ir: ter vivos, a springing- use would have been involved,,- and,such use would' have been- executed by.the transfer of the legal title, whenever that occurred. The testator chose to reach the-end in view by the intervention of trustees, and directing, them to conVey at the proper time. This provision in the will was, therefore, a conditional limitation of the estate, vested in the. trustees,' and nothing more. Their .conveyance was made necessary to pass the title. The duty with which they were charged was an executory trust. Amb. 552. The same rules generally apply to legal and to equitable-estates. They are alike descendible, devisable, and alienable. Croxall v. Sherrerd, 5 Wall. 268. When such uses are consummated and no longer in fieri, the law of perpetuity has no application. Franklin v. Armfield, 2 Sneed (Ky.), 305; Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat; 518; Perrin v. Carey, 24 How. 465. It is intended that what is given shall be perpetually devoted to the purpose of the giver.\nIn the case-last named, the will expressly forbade for ever the'sale *of any part of the devised property. This court held the inhibition valid. Of course, the legislature, or a court of equity under proper circumstances, could authorize or require a sale to be made. Stanley v. Colt, 5 Wall. 119.\nThere may be such an interval of time possible between the gift and the consummation of the use as will- be fatal to the former. The rule of perpetuity applies, as well to trust as to legal estates. The objection is as effectual in one case as in the other. If the fatal period may elapse before what is to be done can be done, the consequence is the same as if such must inevitably be the result. Possibility and certainty 'Have the same effect. Such is the law upon the subject.\nA devise to a corporation to be created by the legislature -is good .as an executory devise. A distinction is taken between a devise in prcesenti to.one incapable, and a devise in futuro to an artificial being, to be created and enabled to take.

(Mass.) 328.\nAt common law, lands may be granted to, pious uses before there is a grantee competent to take. In the mean time, the fee will lie in abeyance. It will vest when the grantee exists. Town of Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 292. See also Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. 566, and Vincennes University v. Indiana, 14 How. 268.\nCharitable uses are favorites with courts of equity. The construction of all instruments where they are. concerned is liberal in their behalf. Mills v. Farmer, 19 Ves. 487; McGill v. Brown, supra; Perry on Trusts, sect. 709; Even the stern rule against perpetuities is relaxed for, their benefit.\n\u201c But a gift may be made to a charity not in esse at the time, \u2014 to come into existence at some uncertain time in the future, \u2014 provided there is no gift of the property in the first instance, or perpetuity in a prior taker.\u201d Perry on Trusts, sect. 736.\nArchbishop Seeker, by his-will, gave \u00bf61,000 to trustees for the purpose of establishing a bishop in the British possessions in America. Mansfield, of counsel, insisted that, \u201c there being no bishop in America, or the least likelihood of there ever being one,\u201d the legacy was void,-and must fall into the residue. Lord Chancellor Thurlow said, \u201c The money must remain in court till it shall be seen whether any such appointment shall take place.\u201d Attorney-General v. The Bishop of Chester, 1 Bro. C. C. 444.\nA testator devised his real estate to trustees, in trust, with the rents and profits to purchase ground in Cambridge, proper for a college, and to build all, such structures as should be necessary for- that purpose (the college to be called \u201c Downing College and to obtain a royal charter for founding such college and \"'incorporating it by that name, in the University of .Cambridge. The trustees were \u2018to hold the premises devised to them \u2018\u2018in trust for the said collegiate body and their successors for' ever.\u201d The devise was held to be valid. Attorney-General v. Downing, Amb. 550.\nA sum of money was bequeathed to er\u00e9et \u00e1, blue-coat school and establish a blind asylum, with direction that' land should not be purchased, and the expression of an expectation that lands would be given for the charities.. In answer to\" the, suggestion at the bar that -the application of the fund might be , indefinitely postponed, it was said, on the other side, that the comet would fix a. time within which the gift must, take effect; and 2 Ves. 547, and 3 Atk. 806, were cited in support of the proposition.\nThe Vice-Chancellor said the cases of Downing College and the Attorney-General v. The Bishop of Chester seemed to be authorities against, the objection, but that the point did not arise in the case before him,-.. It was obviated by a codicil to the will, which-appears to have been overlooked by the coun- . sel on both sides. Henshaw v. Atkins, 3 Madd. 167. See also Philpot v. St.George\u2019s Hospital, 6 Ho. of L. Cas. 359. In this case, as.in the one w\u00e9.are .considering, the trustee was required to approve the designated charity before .paying over ' the money.'\nA testator left a sum of .money to build and endow a future church. \"The question was raised, but not decided, whether thcourt would hold the fund for an indefinite time. The Lord Chancellor said: \u201c A gift to a charitable purpose, if lawful, is good, although no object may be in existence at the time.\" This was expressly decided in Attorney-General v. Bishop of Chester, where \"the gift was for establishing a bishop in his Majesty\u2019s dominions in America,\u201d &c. Sennet v. Herbert, Law Rep. 7 Ch. 237.\nA testatrix, by her will, directed, among other things, that when and as soon as land should be given for the purpose as thereinafter mentioned, almshouses should be built in three specified places. She further directed that, the surplus remaining, after building the almshouses, should be appropriated for making allowances to the inmates. It was held that-the fund, was well given, for that the gift to charity was not conditional and contingent, but that there was an absolute immediate gift to charity, the mode of execution only being made dependent on future events. Chamberlain v. Brocket, 8 Law Rep. Ch. 1872-73, p. 206. The bearing of this authority upon the case in hand needs no remark. See also McIntyre Poor School v. Zanesville Canal Co., 9 Ohio, 203, and Miller v. Chittenden, 2 Iowa, 315; s. c. 4 id. 252. These were controversies relating to real estate. The same point as here was involved. Both gifts were sustained. The judgments are learned and able.\nThe last of this series of cases to which we shall refer is an adjudication by this court. The testator gave the residue of his estate, embracing a large amount of real-property, to the Chancellor of the State of New York] the mayor and recorder of the city of New York, and others, designating them only by their official titles, and to their respective successors in office for ever, in trust to establish and maintain an. asylum for aged, decrepit, and worn-out-sailors, the asylum to be called \u201cThe Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor.\u201d If the trustees so designated could not execute the will, they were to procure from the legislature. an act of incorporation, giving them the requisite authority. Such an act was passed, and the institution was established. The heir-at-law sued for the property. This court held that the official designations were descriptio personarum, and that the trustees took personally. See Bac. Abr., Grant C; Owen v. Bean, Duke on Char. 486; Wellbeloved v. Jones, 1 Sim. & St. 40. Nothing was said as to the capacity of the successors to take. A special act of incorporation was deemed necessary. There being no particular estate to support the final disposition, the latter was held to be an executory, devise. This court decided that the gift was valid. That upon the creation of the corporation the title to the property became vested in it; or that the naked legal title was held by the heir-at-law in trust for the corporation.\nThe points of analogy between that case and* this are obvi ous. There, as here, a,'future, corporation was necessary to give the devise effect, There, as here, there was a possibility that such a corporation might' never be created. In both cases the corporation w\u00e1s created, and the, intention of the testator was carried into full effect. It is a cardinal rule in the law of wills that courts shall do this whenever it can be done. Here we find no impediment in. the way. The gift was immediate and absolute, and it is clear beyond doubt that the testator meant that no part of the property so given should ever go to his heirs-at-law, or be applied to any other object than that to which he had devoted it by the devise here in question.\nThere are numerous other authorities to the same effect with those last cited. The latter are abundantly sufficient to dispose of this case. It is, therefore, unnecessary to extend this opinion, by pursuing the subject further.'\nJudgment affirmed."},{"case_name":"State vs. Sargent & Company","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/752005\/","date":"1877-12-01","court":"Connecticut Supreme Court","content":"Pardee, J.\nBy the common law as it stood long before the coming of our ancestors to this country and the settlement of the colony of New Haven, the king, as parens patriae, held the title to the soil under the sea between high and low water max-k; he held it not for his owxx benefit but for his subjects at large, and for the subjects of all states at peace with him; he held it in trust for public uses, established by ancient custom or x\u2019egulated by law, the most important of which are those of fishing axxd navigation. In 1662 Charles II granted all the lands of the colony by charter to the freemen incox'porated thereby. This coux\u2019t said in Church v. Meeker, 34 Conn., 421, that there had been in this state no judicial determination of the question whether or not that charter conveyed the royal title to the shores of the sea; that the Supreme Courts of Massachusetts, New Jersey and of the United States, having each decided that similar grants did, under the head of \u201c royalties,\u201d convey such title, this court would follow them and declare that the title to the \u201c shores of the sea\u201d vested in the freemen of the colony before the king was excluded by the revolution and independence; and that they, through their legislature, may therefore now exercise all the powers which previous to the grant could have been exercised either by the king alone or by him in conjunction with his parliament, subject only to those restrictions which have been imposed by the constitution of this state or of the United States.\nThe respondents as owners of land bounded on a harbor, own only to high-water mark. It is true they have a right to construct wharves upon the soil below that line if they conform! to such regulations as the state shall see fit to impose upon them and do not obstruct the- paramount right of navigation. From their land bounding upon the shore they hold the exclusive right to embark and go upon the sea, for the reason that no other person can enter upon their land for embarkation or for any other purpose without their permission; but every person has the superior right to navigate the waters opposite thereto without obstruction from any structure erected by them.\nThe duty of protecting this dominant right rests upon the legislature; and they are to determine for themselves by what methods and instrumentalities they will discharge it. It is plain that they themselves cannot descend to the making of frequent examinations into the situation of each riparian proprietor upon our extended coast. There is no bar in reason, and none in the constitution, to the vesting in commissioners appointed by themselves the power to restrain such proprietors from extending structures into navigable waters; they part with no legislative power; they enact the law; the commissioners by the aid of the courts enforce it. Besides, this mode of performing the service which the legislature owes to the commerce of the world has so often received both legislative and judicial sanction in other jurisdictions that it is now quite too late to challenge it.\nThe enactment of the law is in no sense an exercise of the right of eminent domain; it is not that taking of private property for public use for which compensation is to be made. The public do not propose in any manner to appropriate or use any right of the respondents in the soil of the shore, but only to guard against any invasion by them of the paramount right of the public to navigate the waters over it; to enforce against them the maxim \u2014 sic utere tuo ut alienum non locdas. It is only the exercise of the police or supervisory power vested in the legislature \u2014 the power to enact such laws as they deem reasonable and necessary for the regulation of the use by riparian proprietors of their qualified right to the soil of the shore. Indeed no individual is the absolute owner of' any land in so high a sense as that he can set the legislature at defiance as to the use he may make of it; as part of the price to be paid for the privilege of living under law he subjects himself to certain restrictions for the public good; to limitation upon the profitable use of his property for the promotion of the general welfare. The prohibitions against wooden buildings, powder magazines -and slaughter-houses in cities,- are common instances of this.\nThe shore line is irregular-, broken by alternate indentations and projections, and the deep water channel is at every possible angle with, and at varying distances from it. The unrestrained desire of proprietors to build first and farthest leads them to invade and obstruct the channel. Hence the occasion for legislative interference for the preservation of the acknowledged right of all vessels to access to all wharves. Neither in its provisions nor in its mode of execution is the act in violation of any of the fundamental principles of the social compact; on the contrary its effect is greatly for the wealth and peace of the public. The manner of its enforcement is open and fair. The respondents first advised the commissioners specifically of their plans; this opened the door for a hearing; after hearing and consideration the latter advised them that the proposed structure would obstruct the public right of navigation. Here was a day in court; a day before a tribunal presumably impartial and specially qualified to determine the precise matter entrusted to them.\nNor does the law become partial and individual in its scope and operation for the reason that the commissioners are clothed with power to limit the extent to which any proprietor may reach out from his shore line towards or into navigable waters, and that it therefore will result that A, B and 0 will be permitted to build wharves of different lengths. The location of the land of each, the configuration of his shore line, the relative position of the channel, and the outline of the whole harbor as it bears upon his particular case, are all to be taken into consideration and weighed by the commissioners ; they are to determine the largest measure of use of his right to the shore which each can enjoy consistently with the greatest benefit to the public. And this general rule is to be applied alike to the respondents and all other owners; each is to surrender precisely what is necessary to prevent his wharf from being an obstruction. Therefore so far as the law and the reason of its being are concerned the surrender by each is precisely the same.\nWe are to take notice that the wharves in New Haven harbor have now become numerous and valuable; that the effort to extend them has invited public attention and legislative interference; that the act in question is an exception to the ordinary rule by which laws operate only after the adjournment of the legislature enacting them, and is made to take effect upon its passage. From these facts we are to infer that, so far forth as its protecting power is concerned, it was intended for immediate effect; and this is the interpretation to be put upon it. We regard the establishment of a harbor line as a matter quite apart from the duty of the commissioners to take the harbor at once into their keeping. The existence of such a line spanning the whole harbor is not at all necessary to the exercise of their restraining power over a structure immediately to be built. The high and low water lines, and the course of the channel being known, they have all necessary data for action in reference to each case as it arises.\nBut, if in tbeir opinion tbe public right of navigation could be more perfectly protected and the conflicting claims of proprietors more satisfactorily adjusted by the immediate establishment of a line for the whole harbor, in advance of any intention to build wharves, they are authorized to advise the legislature as to the course which in their judgment such a line should follow; but it is obvious that its highest usefulness could only be secured by the immediate exercise of the power to hold all proprietors in check until there is opportunity for legislative action. So far as the erection of any proposed wharf is concerned they must act at once; so far as this general line is concerned they may act at once or never.\nBy section 1, title 22, page 551, of the revision of 1875, it is enacted as follows: \u201cAll public laws, not contained in the foregoing titles, except acts of incorporation, confirming acts, acts which though public in form are of a private nature, and all public laws except such as by particular provision and this title are continued in force, are repealed.\u201d\nThe respondents urge that the act in question is public both in form and nature and therefore is not saved by any of the foregoing exceptions.\nAfter the close of each session of the legislature the secretary of the state has given notice to the public of the acts passed by publishing a part of them in one pamphlet as \u201c public acts,\u201d and a part in another pamphlet as \u201c private acts and resolutions.\u201d The act before us, passed in 1872, was published in the pamphlet of private acts and resolutions for that year. This classification, it is true, was that of the secretary and not of the legislature; but there the public found it, and overlooking the distinctions between acts public in form but of a private nature, and acts public in form but of a special nature, came to regard and speak of this as private; and presumably the legislature of 1875, the members of which were of this public, intended to include it in, and save it under the description of, \u201c acts which though public in form are of a private nature.\u201d Indeed the same legislature, in section 19, page 438, of the revision of 1875, provided that \u201cthe private or special acts of this state shall be legal evidence, and the courts shall take judicial notice of them;\u201d seeming to use the terms \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d as having the same general signification.\nThe legislature of 1869 had passed an act entitled \u201can act to prevent and remove nuisances and obstructions from the channel of Mill River.\u201d This channel is a part of the harbor of New Haven, and the act is essentially of the same nature as the one in question; but the same secretary saw fit to publish it in the pamphlet of public acts for that year, and there the public found it, and, still disregarding distinctions, had come to regard this as a public act. But the legislature of 1875 declares that though public in form it is either local or private in its nature, and in the sixth section protects 'it by special mention from any assertion even that the general words, \u201c all public laws,\u201d in the first section had repealed it. The act in question, that of 1872, never having been printed with the public acts, and always having been regarded as private in nature, stood in no need of such mention for its protection. The legislature recognizing the fact that the general understanding as to what laws are public and what are private is mainly the result of the official declarations made by the secretary from year to year, adapted certain expressions both in the first and in the sixth sections to this popular idea.\nWe think that the act in question has not been repealed.\nWe advise the Superior Court to grant the injunction.\nIn this opinion the other judges concurred."},{"case_name":"ADAMS v.

Union Pacific Railroad Company","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/11286\/","date":"1878-10-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Me. Justice Millee\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\nThe Union Pacific Railroad Company brought the suit provided for in the second section of the act of March 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 508. The case was argued before us on appeal from the judgment of the Court of Claims. All the questions which concern the obligations of the company to pay money to the government, either by way of freight or government transportation, or for the five per cent on the net income of the road, were raised in that suit.\nThe Attorney-General, in pursuance of the directions of the fourth section of the act, filed this bill in equity. Many of the defendants demurred to the bill generally, and at the head of this class is the railroad company.\nThe Circuit Court sustained this demurrer and dismissed the bill, and the case is before us on appeal from that decree.\nNo suggestion is made either here or in the court below of any defect in the bill which can be remedied by amendment. The bill is very elaborate, very ably drawn, and no doubt presents in a very intelligible manner every thing which the facts known or suspected justified the pleader in placing in any bill which can be framed under the special statute authorizing the suit.\nThe question for decision is, therefore, squarely presented to us, as it was to the Circuit Court, whether, by the aid of that statute, and within the limits of the power it intended to confer, this bill can be sustained, under the general principles of equity jurisprudence.\nWe say by the aid of that statute, because it is conceded on all sides that without it the bill cannot stand. The service of compulsory process on a party residing without the limits of the district of Connecticut who is not found within them, is expressly forbidden by the general statute defining the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Parties and subjects of complaint having no proper connection with each other are grouped together in this bill, and they, by the accepted canons of equity pleading, render it multifarious. This, and other matters of like character, which are proper causes of demurrer, are fatal to it, unless the difficulty be cured by the statute.\nWhen we recur to its provisions, which are said to authorize these and other departures from the general rules of equity procedure, counsel for the appellees insist that.it is unconstitutional, not only in the particulars just alluded to, but that it is absolutely void as affecting the substantial rights of defendants in regard to matters beyond the power of Congress.\nIf this be true, we need inquire no further into the frame of the bill, and we therefore proceed, on the threshold, to consider the objections to the validity of the statute.\nThe Constitution declares (art. 3, sect. 2) that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and the treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; and to controversies to which the United States shall be a party.\nThe matters in regard to which the statute authorizes a suit to be brought are very largely those arising under the act which chartered the Union Pacific Railroad Company, conferred on it certain rights and benefits, and imposed on it certain obligations. It is in reference to these rights and obligations that the suit is to be brought. It is also to be brought by the United States, which is, therefore, necessarily the party complainant. Whether, therefore, this suit is authorized by the statute or not, it is very clear that the general subject on which Congress legislated is within the judicial power as defined by the Constitution.\nThe same article declares, in sect. 1, that this \u201c power shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain.\u201d\nThe discretion, therefore, of Congress as to the number, the character, the territorial limits of the courts among which it shall distribute this judicial power, is unrestricted except as to the Supreme Court. On that court the same article of the Constitution confers a very limited original jurisdiction, \u2014 namely, \u201c in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and cases in which a State shall be a party,\u201d \u2014 and an appellate jurisdiction in all the other cases to which this judicial power extends, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.\nThere is in this same section a limitation as to the place of trial of all crimes, which it declares shall (except in cases of impeachment) be held in the State where they shall have been committed, if committed within any State.\nArticle 6 of the amendments also provides that in all criminal prosecutions \u201c the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.\u201d These provisions, which relate solely to the place of the trial for criminal offences, do not affect the general proposition. We say, therefore, that, with the exception of the Supreme Court, the authority of Congress, in creating courts and conferring on them all or much or little of the judicial power of the United States, is unlimited by the Constitution.\nCongress has, under this authority, created the district courts, the circuit courts,' and the Court of Claims, and vested each of them with a defined portion of the judicial power found in the Constitution. It has also regulated the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\nThe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Court of Claims is not confined by geographical boundaries. Each of them, having by the law of its organization jurisdiction of the subject-matter of a suit, and of the parties thereto, can, sitting at Washington, exercise its power by appropriate process, served anywhere within the limits of the territory over which the Federal government exercises dominion.\nIt would have been competent for Congress to organize a judicial system analogous to that of England and of some of the States of the Union, and confer all original jurisdiction on a court or courts which should possess the judicial power with which that body thought proper, within the Constitution, to invest them, with authority to exercise that jurisdiction throughout the limits of the Federal government. This has been done in reference to the Court of Claims. It has now jurisdiction only of cases in which the United States is defendant. It is just as clearly within the power of Congress to give it exclusive jurisdiction of all actions in which the United States is plaintiff. Such an extension of its jurisdiction would include all that the statute under consideration has granted to the Circuit Court.\nIt is true that Congress has declared that no person shall be sued in a circuit court of the United States who does not reside within the district for which the court was established, or who is not found there. But a citizen residing in Oregon may be sued in Maine, if found there, so that process can be served on him. There is, therefore, nothing in the Constitution which forbids Congress to enact that, as . to a class of cases or a case of special character, a circuit court \u2014 any circuit court \u2014 in which the suit may be brought, shall, by process served anywhere in the United States, have the power to bring before it all the parties necessary to its decision.\nWhether parties shall be compelled to answer in a court of the United States wherever they may be served, or shall only be bound to appear when found within the district where the suit has been brought, is merely a matter of legislative discretion, which ought to be governed by considerations of convenience, expense, &c., but which, when exercised by Congress, is controlling on the courts.\nSo, also, the doctrine of multifariousness; whether relating to improperly combining persons or grievances in the bill, it is simply a rule of pleading adopted by courts of equity. It has been found convenient in the administration of justice, and pro-motive of that end, that parties who have no proper connection with each other shall not be compelled to litigate together in the same suit, and that matters, wholly distinct from and having no relation to each other, and requiring defences equally unconnected, shall not be alleged and determined in one suit. The rule itself, however, is a very accommodating one, and by no means inflexible. Such as it is, however, it may be modified, limited, and controlled by the same power which creates the court and confers its jurisdiction. The Constitution imposes no restraint in this respect upon the power of Congress. Sect. 921 of the Revised Statutes, which has been the law for fifty years, declares that when causes of like nature or relating to the same question are pending, the court may consoli date them, or make such other orders as are necessary to avoid costs and delay. It is every-day practice, under this rule, to do what the statute authorizes to be done in the case before us.\nBut it is argued that the statute confers a special jurisdiction to try a single case, and is intended to grant the complainant new and substantial rights, at the expense and by a con sponding invasion of those of the defendants.\nIt does not create a new or special tribunal. Any circu\u00ed court of the United States where the bill might be filed was by the act, invested with the jurisdiction to try the case. Nor was new power conferred on the court beyond those which we have regarded as affecting the mode of procedure. It seems to us that any circuit court, sitting as a court of equity, which could by its process have lawfully obtained jurisdiction of the parties, and considered in one suit all the matters mentioned in the statute, could have done this before the act as well \u00a1 afterwards.\nBut if this be otherwise, we are aware of no constitutio objection to the power of the legislative body to confer on existing court a special jurisdiction to try a specific matt which in its nature is of judicial cognizance.\nThe principal defendant in this suit, the one around which a the contest is ranged, is a corporation created by an act whic reserved the right of Congress to repeal or modify the charter To this corporation Congress made a loan of $27,000,000, and a donation of lands of a value probably equal to the loan.\nThe statute-books of the States are full of acts directing the law officers to proceed against corporations, such as banks, insurance companies, and others, in order to have a decree declaring their charters forfeited. Special statutes are also common, ordering suits against such corporations when they have become insolvent, to wind up their business affairs, and to distribute their assets, and prescribing with minuteness the course of procedure which shall be followed and the court in which the suit shall be brought.\nThis court said, in the case of The Bank of Columbia v. Okely (4 Wheat. 235), in speaking of a summary proceeding given by the charter of that bank for the collection of its debts: \u201c It is the remedy, and not the right, and as such we have no doubt of its being subject to the will of Congress. The forms of administering justice, and the duties and powers of courts as incident to the exercise of a branch of sovereign power, must ever be subject to legislative will, and the power over them is unalienable, so as to bind subsequent legislatures.\u201d And in ' oung v. The Bank of Alexandria (4 Cranch, 397), Mr. Chief iustice Marshall says: \u201cThere is a difference between those \u2022ights on which the validity of the transactions of the corporation depends, which must adhere to those transactions everywhere, and those peculiar remedies which may be bestowed on it. The first are of general obligation ; the last, from their nature, can only be exercised in those courts which the power making the grant can regulate.\u201d See also The Commonwealth v. The Delaware & Hudson Canal Co. et al., 43 Pa. St. 227; State of Maryland v. Northern Central Railroad Co., 18 Md. \u2019 93; Colby v. Dennis, 36 Me. 1; Gowan v. Penobscot Railroad Co., 44 id. 140.\nStatutes of this character, if not so common as to be called inary legislation, are yet frequent enough to justify us in ying that they are well-recognized acts of legislative power niformly sustained by the courts.\nIt may be said, and probably with, truth, that such statutes, \/hen they have been held to be valid by the courts, do not nfringe the substantial rights of property or of contract of the parties affected, but are intended to supply defects of power in the courts, or to give them improved methods of procedure in dealing with existing rights.\nThis leads to an inquiry indispensable to a sound decision of the case before us; namely, does this statute, by its true construction, do any thing more than this ?\nWe might rest this branch of the case upon the concession of counsel for appellants, made both in their brief and in the oral argument, but we proceed to examine the proposition for ourselves.\nThe first suggestion of the legal mind on this inquiry is, that it will not be presumed, unless the language of the statute imperatively requires it, that Congress, by a retrospective law, intended to create new rights in one party to the suit at the expense, or by an invasion of the rights, of other parties; or, where no right of action founded on past transactions existed, that Congress intended to create it.\nThe United States was to be sole complainant in a suit in equity, and though there may be other defendants, the Union Pacific Railroad Company is the only one named in the act. The relief to be granted is the collection and payment of moneys and the restoration of property, or its value, \u201c either to said railroad corporation or to the United States, whichever shall in equity be entitled thereto.\u201d The decree, therefore, can only be made on the ground of some relief to which the United States or the company is entitled by the general principles of equity jurisprudence. It is no objection to granting such relief that the company is a defendant, for by the flexibility of chancery practice a person whose interests in the subject of litigation are on the same side with the complainant may be made a defendant. The corporation could also in such a suit file a cross-bill against the complainant, and, by virtue of this statute, against any co-defendant of whom it could rightfully claim the relief which the statute authorizes.\nBut whatever be the relief asked, it could only, by the express terms of the act, be granted to that party who was in equity thereunto entitled. It is very plain that there was here no new right established. No new cause of equitable relief. No new rule for determining what were the rights of the parties. That was to be decided by the principles of equity; not new principles of equity, but the existing principles of equitable jurisprudence.\nBut the statute very specifically defines the matters which may be embraced in this suit as foundations for relief, and classifies them under a very few heads, by declaring who besides the corporation may be sued. They are persons who have received, \u2014\n1. Capital stock of the company without paying for it in money;\n2. Other property of the company unlawfully and contrary to equity;\n3. As profits or proceeds of contracts for construction, money or other property which ought in equity to belong to the corporation; or,\n4. Persons who have wrongfully received from the United States bonds, moneys, or lands which ought in equity to be accounted for, or paid to it or to the company.\nThere is in this description of the class of persons who may be sued an implied condition that they are already subject to be sued for causes which render them equitably liable. The relief to be granted is also such as to equity belongs.\nWe are of opinion, therefore, that the act in question was intended not to change the substantial rights of the parties to the suit which it authorized, but to provide a specific method of procedure, which, by removing restrictions on the jurisdiction, process, and pleading in ordinary cases, would give a larger scope for the action of the court, and a more economical and efficient remedy than before existed; and that it is a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative power.\nIf in passing on its constitutional validity we have given the subject much consideration, it will be seen that we have at the same time been compelled to give a construction to its language which will go far to enable us to decide whether it authorized the bill that was filed; for we are of opinion that nothing other than what is found in the act, by express language or by fair implication, can be introduced into this suit as a foundation for the action of the court.\nThe Attorney-General is peremptorily ordered to bring the proceeding. The filing of the bill and its subject-matter are both removed from the domain of discretion. For the purposes of this suit, the court wherein it is brought is vested with powers and aided by modes of procedure which it can apply to no other. Parties are subjected to a jurisdiction by process to which the same court cannot subject them in any other suit, and they are required to litigate their rights in a suit common to them and others with whom they could not be joined under the rules governing such matter in any other case.\nWe are bound, therefore, to presume that Congress did not intend that this special remedy should include any thing beyond the matters which we have seen were so carefully and so specifically mentioned as grounds of relief.\nOther provisions of the act show that Congress had, or believed that it had, other grievances against this company for which other remedies are furnished. Any director or officer who violates certain provisions is to be punished criminally. By mandamus in the proper court, but not in this suit, the company is to be compelled to operate its road as required by law. The second section directs the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold payment for transportation for the United States until what is due for interest paid shall be satisfied, and the matter, if disputed, is to be settled by suit brought by the company in the Court of Claims.\nThis consideration makes it clear that any bill brought by the Attorney-General under the fourth section of the act of 1873 must be limited by the provisions of that act, both as to the grievances on which it counts and the relief which it seeks.\nWith these views of the statute under- which this bill is brought, and by which its sufficiency on demurrer must be tested, we approach the examination of the bill itself.\nIt consists of forty-seven pages of printed matter, divided into forty-eight separate paragraphs, each of which undertakes to set forth a distinct ground of relief, or points out the relief which is sought.\nIt will, therefore, be impossible to give in this opinion the results of the separate examination of each of these paragraphs; nor is this at all necessary. A consideration of the principal grounds of relief, grouped as they can easily be under a few heads, will indicate the views which we believe to be sufficient to decide the whole.\nWe will consider together the allegations of the bill against the Wyoming Coal Company, the Credit Mobilier Company, the Pullman Palace Car Company, and the three construction contracts of H. M. Hoxie, Oakes Ames, and James W. Davis. These are by far the most important as regards the sum involved as well as the principles which must decide the case.\nThe substance of the charge is, that the board of directors of the railroad company made contracts for building the road, and for running the Pullman cars on it, and for mining its coal lands and purchasing the coal so mined, which were a fraud upon the company; that these contracts allowed exorbitant prices for work done and material furnished; that otherwise- they were very advantageous to the other contracting parties and injurious to the company; that in all of them the directors, or a controlling majority of them, were interested adversely to the company; that in fact they were, in the name of the company, making contracts with themselves as the other party. In short, it may be taken for granted that if these allegations are true, as they must be held to be on demurrer, frauds more unmitigated than those set forth in this bill were never perpetrated on a helpless corporation by its managing directors.\nThat these frauds are such as a court of equity would relieve against in a proper case, may be seen in the opinion of the Circuit Court for the Nebraska district, in a suit growing out of the Wyoming Coal Company\u2019s contract. Wardell v. The Union Pacific Railroad Co., 4 Dill. 330.\nThe first inquiry arising on these facts is, What relief can be given, and who is entitled to it ?\nThe obvious reply to the first branch of the question is, that the parties who made this contract and received the pecuniary benefit of it can at law be made responsible in damages, or held in equity to compensation for the loss suffered. There would be no difficulty in adjudging in a proper suit that such contracts were void, and then ordering an accounting, on the basis of a fair compensation for what had been done in the way of construction, building, opening mines, furnishing coal, &c., and what had been received for such work and materials. The difficulty is, to whom shall this money be paid when recovered, and can it be recovered in this suit ? If the railroad company, falling into purer hands, had brought such a suit, the bill might be sustained.\nBut the company is not the complainant here. It seeks no relief for these wrongs. It may have been the design of the law to give the corporation an opportunity by a cross-bill to obtain relief against the other defendants, who are charged with these frauds. Such a bill, if not strictly within the rule of equity procedure, which only allows a defendant to file a cross-bill against a complainant, might be sustained under the provisions of this statute. But the company files no such bill. It desires no such relief. On the contrary, it resists by demurrer any further proceeding in the matter. Can it be compelled in this mode to prosecute such a suit ? So long as it exists in the possession and unrestrained exercise of all its corporate powers, its board of directors, unless under judicial prohibition or compulsion, is vested with the sole authority to decide whether it will assert its right of action for a supposed injury, or will condone it.\nThe circumstances of the alleged fraud, the probability of success in the suit, the extent of the injury, the amount which may be recovered, the expense of the proceeding, and the danger of injury to the company itself, are all matters which address themselves to them as grounds for the exercise of the discretion of the directors. They have decided to have nothing to do with it. How, then, can a decree be rendered in their favor, or relief be given them which is not asked ? With what hope of advantage can the court enter upon the inquiry touching the frauds alleged, and the amount of the injury sustained, when the party aggrieved refuses to proceed ?\nOn the other hand, if the court does proceed, shall the decrees, if rendered against the defendants, be in favor of the company? If so, what good results would follow? Since the company resists any decree in its favor now, it would probably enter satisfaction or releases of the decrees as fast as they are rendered. If it did not do this, how would the moneys, if collected and paid into its treasury, be applied ? It is alleged to be insolvent and in debt, but except the claim of the government, which will be presently considered, there is no allegation showing to what use the court can decree the application of these moneys. They must, therefore, go into the treasury of the company, to become subject to the control of its directors, who are now resisting this action. Not only this, but it is obvious that the amount recovered would come mainly out of the same men who now as directors or as stockholders would control the fund, and would probably order its redistribution to the parties who paid it, or give receipts or releases in advance.\nThe truth is, that the persons who were actually defrauded by these transactions, if any such there be, were the few bona fide stockholders who took no part in them, and had no interest in the fraudulent contracts. But it is not alleged that there are such. If there be, they are not made parties to this bill, nor does it provide any relief for them. Yet a moment\u2019s consideration will show that they' alone (to say nothing of the complainant for the present) suffered any legal injury, or are entitled to any relief. As to the directors and stockholders who took part in these fraudulent contracts, they are participes criminis, and can have no relief. This class probably included nine-tenths in value of the shareholders. It is against all the principles of jurisprudence, whether at law or in equity, to permit them to litigate this fraud among themselves. If the innocent stockholders are not parties here, we have alreadj seen that, with the power of the directors over the money re covered, they would get no relief by the suit.\nThe statute, however, did not permit them to be made parties. Their interest is not the same as that of the company. The statute provides only for the collection and payments of money, or the restoration of property, or its value, to the railroad company, or to the United States, as either of them may be in equity held entitled thereto. This does not embrace what a defrauded stockholder may be entitled to in his individual right.\nWe are of opinion, therefore, that no decree can be rendered in favor of the railroad company on account of these transactions, or for the value of the stock not paid for by those who received it. Although issuing it without payment may have been in violation of law, and an implied contract may exist on which the company could compel payment, the United States cannot in this suit recover it, and the company refuses to assert its right thereto.\nThe same principle applies to the arrangements made by the railroad company with the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company, and with the Omaha Bridge Company, which are here assailed. These are existing contracts under which the business of the principal corporation with the others is conducted, and with which it is satisfied. It asks no rescission, and is content to comply with them. It is not within the power of the court to annul them, or to make new ones for the parties.\nNo decree can therefore be rendered on this bill in favor of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, because it is not the complainant, but a defendant, and, asking no affirmative relief or any other, it resists being brought into this suit, and refuses to plead in it any further than compelled by the court.\nIf there is any relief to which the United States is entitled against the company, the latter, being a defendant, must remain and answer to the claim. But it is conformable to the principles neither of the common law nor of equity to compel it to prosecute a suit as complainant which it disapproves, or to establish a claim which it denies, or take a decree where it asserts nothing to be due.\nWe must now inquire whether the bill makes a case in which the United States, the complainant, is entitled under the terms of the statute to relief.\nThe United States is not, and never has been, a stockholder in this company. It is a creditor.\nThe government sustains two distinct relations to the railroad company, and, in considering her rights under this statute, it is important to keep them separate. The company is organized under, and owes its corporate existence to, an act of Congress. The government has all the rights which belong to any other government as a sovereign and legislative power over this creation of that power. That this power should not be too much crippled by the doctrine that a charter is a contract, the eighteenth section declares that Congress may at any time, having due regard for the rights of the companies named therein, add to, alter, amend, or repeal the act. The power of Congress, therefore, in its sovereign and legislative capacity over this corporation is very great.\nThe government, however, holds another very important relation, namely, that of contract. It has loaned to the company $27,000,000, and granted to it on certain terms many million acres of land. The government is paying all the time the semi-annual interest on its own bonds, loaned to the company. The company is bound by contract to pay them, principal and interest, at their maturity. The government by the contract has a lien on the road and its appurtenances to secure this payment. The company is also bound by the contract to perform for the government all the transportation and tele graphing that may be required of it, and to keep its road and line always in order and readiness to render these services. It may have other contract obligations to the government not here mentioned, but these are all that are important to our inquiry. The government has delivered its bonds to the company. The company has built the road, owns it, and operates it. Does the bill allege any thing which, growing out of this contract, entitles the United States to relief?\nOne of its allegations is that there is due to the United States and unpaid, on account of interest on the bonds, the sum of $6,198,700, and that the balance of interest for which the company is liable is rapidly accumulating. It was filed in May, 1873, and this court, at its October Term, 1875, decided, in United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (91 U. S. 72), that the company was not bound to pay this interest until the bonds mature, except so far as the act made in that regard two special provisions. One was that half the compensation for transportation performed for the United States should, as provided by the subsequent amended charter of 1864, be withheld by the government for that purpose; the other was that after the completion of the road five per cent of its net earnings were to be applied annually to extinguish the debt to the United States.\nThe second section of the act of 1873, as we have seen, provides for the first of these cases, and as to the other, the government has brought suits, which are now ripe for decision in this court.\nThere is, therefore, no ground for relief on account of money due by the company to the United States.\nIt is said that the latter, as a creditor whose lien is endangered by the extravagance of the company, and the misappropriation of its means, has the right to come into equity for preventive relief to secure the collection of the sums of which the company has been defrauded.\nThe government made its contract and bargained for its security. It had a first lien on the road by the original act of incorporation, which would have made its loan safe in any event. But in its anxiety to secure the rapid prosecution of the work, \u2014 an end more important to it than to any one else, and still more important to the people whom it represented, postponed this lien to another mortgage, that the means mig be raised to complete the road. It has the second lien, lion ever, and the right to appropriate one-half of the price it annually pays for the use of the road, \u2014 a very large sum, \u2014 and five per cent of the net earnings of the road, which may become much larger, to the extinction of this debt. It is not wholly unreasonable to suggest that the amount which the company may be compelled to pay annually, under these two provisions, will be sufficient as a sinking fund to pay the entire debt, principal and interest, before it falls due.\nIt is difficult to see any right which as a creditor the government has to interfere between the corporation and those with whom it deals. It has been careful to protect its interests in making the contract, and it has the right which that contract gives. What more can it ask? It is true that there is \u00e1 allegation of insolvency. But in what that insolvency consists is not clearly shown. It has a floating debt. What railroad company has not ? It is said it does not pay the interest on its debt to the United States. We have shown that it owes the United States no money that is due. There is no allegation that it does not pay the interest on all its own funded debt. The allegation as it is would be wholly insufficient to place the corporation in bankruptcy, even if that was not forbidden by the act under which this bill is drawn. The facts stated are utterly insufficient to support a creditor\u2019s bill by the United States. That requires a judgment at law, an execution issued, and a return of nulla bona. Here there is no judgment, no money due, and no sufficient allegation of insolvency.\nWe are unable, therefore, to see any relief to which under this bill the United States, on account of its contract relations with the company, would be entitled in a court of equity.\nIf we look at the statute this is still clearer. The moneys due for unpaid stock, or for property of the company unlawfully received, or as profits in fraudulent contracts for construction, are all described in the act as belonging to the corporation, and to be restored to it. Those who may have wrongfully and unlawfully received from the United States bonds, moneys, or lands which ought in equity to be accounted for and paid to it or to\nompany, may be compelled to pay tbe moneys or restore tbe operty to the party, which shall in equity be entitled thereto. But, in this connection, no one but the company has received property, lands, or moneys from the United States. There is no allegation that the moneys were not used to build the road. If there was, there is nothing now due, and the company is performing all its obligations to the government under the contract.\njfhe hill establishes no right in the government, under this or. any other clause of the act, to recover in its own right any property or money from the company.\nIn its sovereign or legislative relation to the company, the United States has powers the extent of which it is unnecessary to define in this case. The two sections of the act, under one of, which this suit was instituted, are instances of the exercise f these powers, and they affect the interest of the company in .u^prtant particulars. Congress might also have directed the Attorney-General, either as part of this proceeding or as an independent one, to ask the court to declare the franchises of the company forfeited. It might have ordered a bill to inquire if the company was insolvent, and if so, to wind up its affairs and distribute its assets. In short, there are many modes in which the legislature could have called into operation all the judicial powers known to the law. But it has not done so, and that is the constantly recurring answer to this bill. It provided in the statute for a mode of securing a full inquiry into the affairs of the company, by enacting that the Secretary of the Treasury should have free access to all its books and correspondence, \u2014 a mode of obtaining information far more effective- than a bill of discovery. The statute, therefore, did not authorize a bill of discovery. Not wanting the company declared bankrupt and closed out by a decree of the court, Congress enacted that it should hot be subject to the bankrupt law, as other corporations were, but should continue to exercise its franchises and perform its duties, and that it might be compelled to do this by a writ of mandamus from the proper court. It limited the relief to be granted under this act, therefore, both by the terms in which it was granted and by other provisions, to the recovery of a moneyed decree, or a restoration of specific property to which the United States or the company was by law entitled.\nIt is useless, therefore, to inquire what might have been done by some other legislation, or what, independently of legislation, are the rights of the government; for we can only act on such as are recognized by the act under which the Circuit Court proceeded.\nThis brings us to the consideration of the last ground of relief which we propose to notice, and which, with the alleged right to a decree in favor of the company against the individuals and corporations who have defrauded it, is most earnestly insisted on here.\nThe proposition is that the United States, as the grantor of the franchises of the company, the author of its charter, and . the donor of lands, rights, and privileges of immense value, and as parens patries, is a trustee, invested with power to enforce the proper use of the property and franchises granted for the benefit of the public.\nThe legislative power of Congress over this subject has already been considered, and need not be further alluded to. The trust here relied on is one which is supposed to grow out of the relations of the corporation to the government, which, without any aid from legislation, are cognizable in the ordinary courts of equity.\nIt must be confessed that, with every desire to find some clear and well-defined statement of the foundation for relief under this head of jurisdiction, and after a very careful examination of the authorities cited, the nature of this claim of right remains exceedingly vague. Nearly all the cases \u2014 we may almost venture to say all of them \u2014 fall under two heads : \u2014\n1. Where municipal, charitable, religious, or eleemosynary corporations, public in their character, had abused their franchises, perverted the purpose of their organization, or misappropriated their funds, and as they, from the nature of their corporate functions, were more or less under government supervision, the Attorney-General proceeded against them to obtain correction of the abuse; or,\n2. Where private corporations, chartered for definite and limited purposes, had exceeded their powers, and were restrained or enjoined in the same manner from the further violation of the limitation to which their powers were subject.\nThe doctrine in this respect is well condensed in the opinion in The People v. Ingersoll, recently decided by the Court of Appeals of New York. 58 N. Y. 1. \u201c If,\u201d says the court, \u201c the property of a corporation be illegally interfered with by corporation officers and agents or others, the remedy is by action at the suit of the corporation, and not of the Attorney-General. Decisions are cited from the reports of this country and of this State, entitled to consideration and respect, affirming to some extent the doctrine of the English courts, and applying it to like cases as they have arisen here. But in none has the doctrine been extended beyond the principles of the English cases ; and, aside from the jurisdiction of courts of equity over trusts of property for public uses and over the trustees, either corporate or official, the courts have only interfered at the instance of the Attorney-General to prevent and prohibit some official wrong by municipal corporations or public officers, and the exercise of usurped or the abuse of actual powers.\u201d p. 16.\nTo bring the present case within the rule governing the exercise of the equity powers of the court, it is strongly urged that the company belongs to the class first described.\nThe duties imposed upon it by the law of its creation, the loan of money and the donation of lands made to it by the United States, its obligation to carry for the government, and the great purpose of Congress in opening a highway for public use and the postal service between the widely separated States of the Union, are relied on as establishing this proposition.\nBut in answer to this it must be said that, after all, it is but a railroad company, with the ordinary powers of such corporations. Under its contract with the government, the latter has taken good care of itself; and its rights may be judicially enforced without the aid of this trust relation. They may be aided by the general legislative powers of Congress, and by those reserved in the charter, which we have specifically quoted.\nThe statute which conferred the benefits on this company, the loan of money, the grant of lands, and the right of way, did the same for other corporations already in existence under State or territorial charters. Has the United States the right to assert a trust in the Federal government which would authorize a suit like this by the Attorney-General against the Kansas Pacific Railway Company, the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and other companies in a similar position ?\nIf the United States is a trustee, there must be cestuis que trust. There cannot be the one without the other, and the trustee cannot be a trustee for himself alone. A trust does not exist when the legal right and the use are in the same party, and there are no ulterior trusts.\nWho are the cestuis que trust for whose benefit this suit is brought? If they be the defrauded stockholders, we have already shown that they are capable of asserting their own rights; that no provision is made for securing them in this suit should it be successful, and that the statute indicates no such purpose.\nIf the trust concerned relates to the rights of the public in the use of the road, no wrong is alleged capable of redress in this suit, or which requires such a suit for redress.\nRailroad Company v. Peniston (18 Wall. 5) shows that the company is not a mere creature of the United States, but that while it owes duties to the government, the performance of which may, in a proper case, be enforced, it is still a private corporation, the same as other railroad companies, and, like them, subject to the laws of taxation and the other laws of the States in which the road lies, so far as they do not destroy its usefulness as an instrument for government purposes.\nWe are not prepared to say that there are no trusts which the United States may not enforce in a court of equity against this company. When such a trust is shown, it will be time enough to recognize it. But we are of opinion that there is none set forth in this bill which, under the statute authorizing the present suit, can be enforced in the Circuit Court.\nThere are many matters alleged in the bill in this case, and many points ably presented in argument, which have received our careful attention, but of which we can take no special notice in this opinion. We have devoted so much space to the more important matters, that we can only say that, under the view which we take of the scope of the enabling statute, they furnish no ground for relief in this suit.\nThe liberal manner in which the government has aided this company in money and lands is much urged upon us as a reason why the rights of the United States should be liberally construed. This matter is fully considered in the opinion of the court already cited, in United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (supra), in which it is shown that it was a wise liberality for which the government has received all the advantages for which it bargained, and more than it expected. In the feeble infancy of this child of its creation, when its life and usefulness . were very uncertain, the government, fully alive to its importance, did all that it could to strengthen, support, and sustain it. Since it has grown to a vigorous manhood, it may not have displayed the gratitude which so much care called for. If this be so, it is but another instance of the absence of human affections which is said to characterize all corporations. It must, however, be admitted that it has fulfilled the purpose of its creation and realized the hopes which were then cherished, and that the government has found it a useful agent, enabling it to save vast sums of money in the transportation of troops, mails, and supplies, and in the use of the telegraph.\nA court of justice is called on to inquire not into the balance of benefits and favors on each side of this controversy, but into the rights of the parties as established by law, as found in. their contracts, as recognized by the settled principles of equity, and to decide accordingly. Governed by this rule, and by the\u2019 intention of the legislature in passing the act under which this suit is brought, we concur with the Circuit Court in holding that no case for relief is made by the bill.\nDecree affirmed."},{"case_name":"UNITED STATES v. HUMPHREYS et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/6133225\/","date":"1879-02-11","court":"United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia","content":"HUGHES. District Judge.\nThe very able and informing briefs of counsel leave me nothing to do but state the points of the case, and deduce a decision from the authorities which govern it. The United States obtained a judgment in October, 1877, against Joseph M. Humphreys, late collector of customs at Richmond, and his sureties on his official bond. In January, 1878, Humphreys executed a deed of trust to secure money borrowed, through Thomas N. Page, on lands of his lying in the county of Henrico, near the city of Richmond. The United States bvings its bill in equity in this court against J. M. Humphrey's and other proper parties defendant to subject this land to the lien of its judgment. And the single question in the case before the court is, whether the judgment is of higher dignity than the trust deed, and can be enforced as against the lien of the debt secured by that deed.\nThe contention of the trust creditor is that the United States lost its lien and the benefit of its priority in time over the deed by failing to docket its judgment in pursuance of the requirement of the eighth section of chapter 182 of the Code of Virginia, which provides that \u201cno judgment shall be,a lien on real estate as against a purchaser thereof for valuable consideration without notice, unless it is docketed\u201d in the county or corporation where the land lies, on the judgment docket required to be kept by the clerk of eacli county or corporation court of the scaue; either within sixty days next after the date ' of such judgment, or fifteen days before the conveyance of said estate to the purchaser.\nI shall first consider the question as if the judgment creditor was a private creditor. The sixth section of the same chapter of the Code of Virginia provides that \u201cevery judgment for money rendered in this state heretofore or hereafter against any person shall be a lien on all real estate of such person.\u201d This provision was first embodied in the Code of 1849. Previously to that time, aiid, indeed, subsequently until March 26, 1872, the writ of eleglt was in use in Virginia; but on that date that writ was finally abolished by special act of the legislature. Such being the law of Virginia as to the lien of judgments in the state courts, the next inquiry is, how does the law thus existing apply to judgments of courts of the United States rendered in the state of Virginia?\nIt is well-settled law that judgments rendered in the courts of the United States are liens upon the defendant\u2019s real estate in all cases where similar judgments of the state-courts are made liens by the law of the state. Wood v. Chamberlain, 2 Black [67 U. S.] 430; more particularly page 438 et seq. Many other decisions of the supreme court of the United States might be cited to the same effect. These judgments are liens, not by virtue of the adoption of state laws by the United States courts, by' rules of court or otherwise, but by virtue of acts of congress giving the same effect to final process of United States courts as is given by state laws to process of the courts of the states in which they are held; giving the same remedies on judgments and decrees of federal courts as are given by state law's on judgments and decrees of state courts; and giving authority to the United States courts to make proper rules for securing these objects. We are therefore to look to acts of congress on this subject to ascertain how far judgments of United States courts in Virginia are liens up on lands. If there had been no such act of-assembly as that of March 26, 1872, abolishing the writ of elegit in Virginia, it might probably be contended that in Virginia the process act of congress of 1828 [4 Stat. 278], is not repealed by the act of congress of June 1, 1872 [17 Stat 196], now section 916 of the Revised- Statutes of the United States, and that the writ of elegit lies from the United States courts in this state; and that the lien of the writ of elegit is, unlike that given by section 6 of chapter 182 of the Code, not subject to the condition of docketing the judgment imposed by section 8 of that chapter. Btit the Virginia law of March, 1872, does abolish the elegit, and section 916- in . the Revised Statutes, giving the same effect to, and remedies on, judgments of the United States courts as were then (1874) given by state law to judgments of state courts, repeals by substitution in Virginia the process act of 1828 as to the elegit, whatever it may do in other states, under the particular legislation of those states bearing upon this subject Decisions of United States courts in -other states, seemingly in conflict with this view, were rendered upon the condition of state legislation in those states, and do not necessarily apply to the condition of. legislation in Virginia.\nThe judgment in this case against Hum-phreys became a lien upon his lands just as it would have become if it had been a judgment of a state court; and the remaining question is, whether by the execution of the deed of trust which Humphreys gave in January, 1878, the judgment \u201cceased\u201d to be a lien under the operation of the 967th section of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which provides that judgments of United States courts within a state \u201cshall cease to be liens on real estate, etc., in the same manner and at such periods as judgments of the courts of the state cease by law to be liens thereon.\u201d I do not doubt that so far as this law shall operate proprio vigore in any case \u2014for instance, as a statute of limitations\u2014 the lien of a judgment of a United States court would cease just as that of a state court would do under a state statute of limitation; but I am precluded by a current of decisions rendered by courts of the United States from holding that the lien of 'a judgment of a United States court ceases in the event it is not docketed in accordance with a state law as against a subsequent purchaser without notice. I am precluded from holding that the lien of the judgment in this case ceased in January, 1878, as against the trustee\u2019s title under the deed of trust executed in that month by Humphreys. The decisions of the United States courts have been in nothing more uniform, unvarying, and consistent than in holding that where rights once attach under laws of congress adopting laws of the respective states, these rights are not divested by a non-compliance with eondi-tions, restrictions, or limitations contained in those very state laws, where a compliance with the latter would depend upon a resort in any way to state officials, or to the machinery of the state.judiciary.\nThe provision of the Code of Virginia making a judgment for money a lien upon the real estate of the debtor makes, in the eighth section of chapter 182, an exception in favor of a subsequent purchaser without notice, where the judgment has not been docketed. The process of docketing depends upon the action of an officer of a state court in keeping a docket, and upon -that officer\u2019s actually docketing the judgment of the United States court when presented. There is no law of Virginia requiring this officer to docket the judgment of a United States court. He acts strictly in a ministerial capacity, and is not required by any express law to enter such a judgment when presented for such a purpose. Congress, on its part, has not (as -I think it should do) by law required clerks of United States courts to keep such dockets in each district as the law of Virginia requires to be kept in each county. So -as to other restrictions, exceptions, limitations, and conditions which state laws conferring rights insert in the laws conferring them. I think it may be laid down as a rul\u00e9 having few exceptions that in any case of a law of a state conferring rights upon conditions, or with exceptions, and adopted by congress as operative in that state, wherever the exceptions or conditions depend upon the action of state officers, so that the enjoyment of rights thus once conferred could be defeated or divested by the action, or refusal to act, of a state officer, such-a condition, or exception, m tue state law is uniformly held by the United States courts not to limit the rights conferred by the act of congress adopting the state law. This was decided in Palmer v. Allen, 7 Cranch [11 U. S.] 550-64; Wagram v. Southard, 10 Wheat. [23 U. S.] 1; U. S. Bank v. Halstead, Id. 51; Boyle v. Zacharie, 6 Pet [31 U. S.) 648; and (more particularly in their bearing upon the question now under consideration) Massengill v. Downs, 7 How. [48 U. S.] 760; and Carroll v. Watkins [Case No. 2,457]. In these last cases the law of Mississippi, giving the lien in favor of judgments for money, was modified by provisions requiring judgments to be docketed, and making exceptions in favor of subsequent purchasers without notice as against judgments not docketed\u2014provisions identical in purport with those of Virginia. But the supreme court of the United States held in the former case that in states where judgments create liens a judgment of a United States court has that operation throughout the judicial district in which it is rendered, and any provisions of state legislation modifying the lien of judgments and restricting their operation cannot affect the lien of a judgment of a United States court. I think the deci sion of the supreme court in Massengill v. Downs [supra], is decisive of the question under consideration, and requires me to decide that the judgment of this court rendered in October, 1877, is good against the trust-deed executed in January following, and that the lien created by section 916 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, adopting section 6 of chapter 182 of the Virginia Code, is not controlled or affected by section 8 of that chapter of the Virginia Code. This court has decided that a lis pendens in a United States court binds property in litigation, though not recorded and docketed, as required by state law if in a state court Ruth-erglen v. Wolf [Case No. 12,175].\nI do not think it necessary to go farther and inquire whether a judgment in favor of the United States has the same force as a judgment in favor of the state of Virginia in this state, and as a judgment in favor of the crown in England. lam inclined to believe on authority, and would so decide if necessary in this case, that judgments in favor of the United States stand on the same principle as those in favor of the commonwealth and of the crown; that they are a lien independently of laws making judgments generally a lien upon the estates of debtors, and do not depend upon those laws. Although tiie ancient writ in favor of the crown of extendi facias is obsolete by mere disuse, having given place to more efficient remedies, yet I imagine that it still lies theoretically; and its theoretical existence is sufficient to establish the liens in this country of judgments in favor of the state and federal governments. Their precedence over all liens in favor of private persons stands upon such broad maxims as \"Salus populi suprema lex,\u201d \u201cThesaurus regis est pacis vinculum, et bellorum nervi,\u201d and the like. Certain prerogatives of the crown belong, in the United States, not only to the state governments, but to that in the United States. Those which belonged to the king in England as parens patriae, as distinguished from those which belonged to his person, survive to the government of the United States in this country. Dollar Savings Bank v. U. S., 19 Wall. [86 U. S.] 239. This doctrine is well settled in respect to the state governments; more particularly by Com. v. McGowan, 4 Bibb, 62; Leake v. Ferguson, 2 Grat. 436; and Com. v. Baldwin. 1 Watts. 54. Authorities might be multiplied if it were necessary. It might not be necessary, in respect to recent judgments in favor of the United States, to resort to a bill in chancery for the enforcement of them upon real estate. But where they have been standing for any length of time, and junior liens have supervened, 1 think the proper method of proceeding is the same as would be proper in respect to judgments in favor of citizens.\u2014-that is to say, by bill.\u2014and that such a course has been properly taken in this case."},{"case_name":"State, use Oliver, Adm\u2019r, vs. Rottaken, Adm\u2019r, et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1875689\/","date":"1879-05-01","court":"Arkansas Supreme Court","content":"Battle, Sp.

The demurrer was sustained as to so much thereof as says there is no equity in the action, and was overruled as to the other causes assigned.\nPlaintiff, with leave of the court, filed an amendment to her complaint, and therein stated that Skelton left surviving him, at his death, eight children, heirs and distributees \u2014 their names; and when they respectively arrived at the age of twenty-one years; that while they were minors their mother moved with them from the state of Arkansas, and from thence hitherto they have \"been non-residents of this state; that no assets of the estate of Trigg ever came to the hands or possession of Eottaken ; and asked that Skelton\u2019s heirs be made and considered parties plaintiff's, joining in the further prose cution of this action, aud renewed1 the prayer of the original complaint.\nDefendant, Watkins, demurred to the amended complaint, because the facts stated therein are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff declining to amend further, the complaint was dismissed; judgment for costs was rendered in favor of defendants against plaintiff; and plaintiff excepted and appealed.\nThe complaint and amendment thereto fail to show that any part of the assets received by Trigg remained in specie at the time of his death, or were capable of being ascertained and identified as the specific property and estate of Skelton.

How and on what account this balance became due, plaintiff fails to explain. The only l'easonable conclusion which can be drawn from the complaint and amendment is, it was due and owing by Trigg on account of assets of the estate of Skelton lost, wasted or converted by him, in his lifetime. If the conclusion be correct, does the amended complaint show that plaintiff has or had a cause of action against the defendants or either of them?\nIt is said, that by the old law of England the king was entitled to seize upon the goods of all intestates as the parens patriae, and general trustee of the kingdom. This prerogative he exercised for some time by his own ministers of justice. Afterwards the crown, in favor of the church, invested the prelates with this branch of the prerogative. The goods of intestates were given to the ordinary by the crown; and he had the right to seize them, and keep them without wasting, and also might give them, alien, or sell them at his will, and dispose of the money in pios usas. For the discharge of this trust the prelates were only accountable to God and their own consciences. This trust they abused most outrageously, and in the name of the church and the poor, the whole residue of the deceased\u2019s estate, after the partes rationabiles of the wife and child were deducted, took unto themselves, without paying even his lawful debts, or other charges thereon. To check this exorbitant power, entrusted with ordinaries, it was enacted by'the Statute of Westminister 2 (13 Edwr., 1 C., 19), that the ordinary should pay the debts of the intestate, so far as his goods would extend. But this statute did not afford adequate relief. After the payment of the debts there was very often left a residuum to be used as the ordinaries might see fit to apply. This power they used in a most iniquitous manner, and thereby caused parliament, by the Statute 31, Edwr. Ill, 0'., 11, to further enact, that in case of intestacy, the ordinary should depute the neai\u2019est and most lawful friends of the deceased to administer his goods ; and thereby gave origin, to administrators, who, before this statute, were unknown to the laws of England. - Under the Statute 31, Edwr. III, an administrator became the deputy of the ordinary, and clothed with all the authority and power which the ordinary previously had in the administration of estates. The legal title to the personal estate of his intestate vested in him. lie had the power to alter, change or convert any portion thereof to his own use, and such portion was thereby fully administered, and became a part of his estate, and descended to his legal representatives. But inasmuch as be held in autre droit, and, therefore, had no right to dispose, by will, of the property which remained in specie at his death, it still remaining the property and estate of his intestate, it resulted back to the ordinary to appoint a receiver. So, too, when an executor died intestate, his administrator did not become the representative of his testator, but, as in case of the deceased administrator, it became the duty of the ordinary to appoint an administrator of the testator with the will annexed. In both cases, the appointment of an administrator was for the purpose of completing an administration already begun. It was not, as in case of the first administrator, a full and immediate administration of the \u201cgoods, chattels and credits, which were-of the testator or intestate at the time of his death,\u201d but an administration de bonis non administratis. The commission of the second administrator only vested him with the power and authority, and imposed upon him the duty of collecting and administering \u201c such property and effects of the deceased, not administered by the former representative, as remained in specie, and were capable of being ascertained and identified as the specific property or estate represented by him.\u201d To this extent, only, did his power, authority and duty extend. He could not sue the former executor or administrator, or his sureties, on his executorial or administration bond, in law or equity, for property wasted, lost, altered or converted by the first executor or administrator. Such liability of the former executor or administrator, or his sureties, was no part of the estate of the testator or intestate, on which the administrator de bonis non had a right to administer, but was \u201ca chose in action belonging to those entitled to the estate as creditors, legatees, or distributees.\u201d In such cases the creditors, legatees or distributees only, were authorized to sue. Finn et al. v. Hempstead et al\u201e24 Ark., 117; Coleman v. McMurdo, 5 Rand., 51; Potts et al. v. Smith, 3 Rawle, 360; Warfield v. Brand\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 13 Bush. (Ky.), 77; Beal v. New Mexico, 16 Wallace, 540; 3 Redfield on the Law of Wills, star page 103; 1 Lomax on Executors, marginal pages, 335-339; 1 Williams on Executors, marg. pages, 822-827; 4 Bacon\u2019s Abr., 24.\nIn equity, the executor or administrator holds the property of his testator or intestate, in trust for the benefit of those concerned, first for the benefit of the creditors, and then for the legatees, or, in case of intestacy, for the distributees under the statute of distributions. And the assets are treated and regarded as a trust fund, \u201cto be administered by the executor,\u201d or administrator\u2019, \u201c tor the benefit of all persons who are interested in it, whether they are creditors, legatees or distributees, or otherwise interested, according to their relative priorities, privileges and equities.\u201d Eor the benefit and at the instance of those inter\u25a0ested, only, will a court of equity interfere to protect the trust funds, and hold the executor, or administrator, or his legal representative and sureties, accountable for waste and mismanagement of the same, and cause it to be administered of disposed of according to their relative priorities, rights, interests, privileges and equities. (1 Story\u2019s Eq., secs. 532, 579, 580). As we have already seen, the administrator cle bonis non can not, and does not, stand in the relation of cestui que trust to the trust fund; nor does the executor or administrator hold the same in trust for his use and benefit. His commission gives him a right which is purely of a legal nature, and which extends only to so much of the goods, chattels and credits as remains in specie, and can be identified as the specific property or estate of the deceased. Hence, it follows that he has no right to institute suit, in a court of equity, to hold the representative or sureties of a former executor or administrator accountable for property lost, wasted, mismanaged or converted, by such former executor or administrator.\nThe power, authority and duties of an administrator de bonis non remain and are the same in this state as we have already seen they were under the common law of England and statutes of the British parliament, unless they have been changed by statute. Have they been changed? They have not. It is true that sec. of Gantt\u2019s Digest says: \u201c If any executor or administrator die or resign, or his letters be revoked, he, or his legal representatives, shall account for, pay, and deliver to his successor, or the surviving or remaining executor, all money and personal property, and all the rights, credits, deeds, evidence of debt, and papers of any kind belonging to the estate of the deceased, at such time and in such manner as the court shall order; and such court, in case of a refusal to comply with such order, shall have power to enforce the same by attachment.\u201d But what money, personal property, lights, credits, deeds, evidence of debt and papers are referred to in this section? Manifestly, such as remains in specie. The former executor or administrator, or his legal representative, could not account for, pay and deliver to his successor any other assets. No other assets belong to the estate of the deceased. And it would be absurd to require and force him by attachment to account for, pay over and deliver to his successor something which had ceased to exist, and was beyond his reach and control. He could not be forced by attachment; and it would be impossible for him to account for, pay over, 'and deliver to his successor any assets other than those in specie, and capable of being identified as the specific property or estate of the deceased. It could not be any money which the deceased administrator was liable to pay on account of assets lost, wasted, or converted by him; for the same stat utes expressly provide how demands and claims for money against the estates of deceased persons shall be authenticated, presented, classed, and paid, and that, too, in a way and manner entirely different from that provided for the payment and delivery of assets under sec. 44 cited above.\nInstead of giving the administrator de bonis non the right to sue on the bond of a former administrator, and recover any amount fo\u00a9 which he may be liable on account of any waste or mismanagement of the estate of the deceased, sec. 191 of Gantt\u2019s Digest, on the contrary, expressly provides: \u201c The bond of any executor or administrator may be sued on at the instance of any legatee, distributee, creditor, or other person interested, in the name of the state, to the use of such legatee, distributee, creditor, or other person interested, for any mismanagement, waste, or other breach of the condition of such bond ; and the party to whose use suit is brought, shall have judgment against the executor or administrator, and his securities, for the whole value oftheestate mismanaged or toasted, with costs of suit; and the amount so recovered shall be distributed by the court in the same manner as if the same had been accounted for by the executor or administrator.\u201d This statute in no wise changes the remedies in the cases therein provided for, but substantially re-enacts the law which was in force in such cases at the time of its enactment, and thereby perpetuates it in every material point. Under it, the administrator de bonis non has no authority to sue, because he has not, and from the nature of the case could not have, an interest in the assets wasted or mismanaged, or the liability therefor, as we have already seen.\nBut has Oliver, as public administrator, greater power and authority and more rights than he would have if he had been regularly appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate of Skelton ? \"What are the powers, authority and duties of a public administrator, as defined by the statute ? The statutes make it his duty to take charge of all the estates of every kind, of the deceased persons in his county, in certain enumerated cases, and to \u201cinstitute all manner of suits that may be necessary to recover the property, debts, papers or other estate of the deceased, in the same manner as if letters of administration were actually granted to him.\u201d If property comes into his hands, he is required to enter into the like bond and security as is prescribed in cases of administrators in ordinary cases, and to make true and perfect inventory thereof, \u201c and administer and account for the same as near as circumstances will permit, according to the law prescribing the duties of administrators, subject to the coiitrol and direction of the court.\u201d \u201cHe holds the estate until an executor or administrator is regularly appointed, when, under the order of the court, he is required to account for, pay and deliver to such executor or administrator all the money, property and estate of every kind in his possession. He is required to act as a temporary administrator for the preservation of the estates of deceased persons in his county, liable to be wasted, injured or lost; and to bring suits for the recovery of the estate in the same manner he would do if letters of administration were actually granted to him. No statute or law, other than those governing administrators, define his power and authority, and prescribe his duties as to the estates in his charge. The same law which defines the power and authority and prescribes the duties of administrators is made applicable to him. There is no statute giving him greater power and authority than is granted to administrators regularly appointed, or giving him power to administer any more or other goods, chattels, rights and effects, than an administrator of the same estate, regularly appointed, would have. Hence it follows that Oliver, as public administrator, had no more or greater power, authority and rights than he would have if he had been regularly appointed administrator de bonis non; and that he only fills the place of an administrator de bonis non ;pro tempore, and until an administrator de bonis non shall be regularly appointed. Gantt\u2019s Digest, sec. 216, 233.\nPlaintiff alleges in her complaint that Oliver was appointed administrator of the estate of Skelton, on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1871. Taking it for granted that the appointment was valid, he thereby became the administrator de bonis non of Skelton\u2019s estate, and thereafter had no right to sue or recover any assets of the estate of Skelton, in his capacity of public administrator; and in such capacity could not maintain this action. Gantt\u2019s Digest, sec. 220.\nCould or can an action he instituted and maintained on the bond of Trigg for assets of the estate of Skelton, which were received and held by Trigg while he was administrator, and were on hand at his death, and capable of being ascertained and identified as such assets, or for damages suffered by reason of the waste and mismanagement- thereof since his death ? Certainly not. Section 44, cited above, makes it the duty of the executor or administrator, when his administration terminates in his lifetime, to account for, pay, and deliver the assets remaining in specie, under the order of the probate court, to his successor; and in the event he dies before he is discharged or removed, it makes it the duty of his legal representative to account for, pay and deliver so much of the assets as remain in specie and were capable of being identified and ascertained, in like manner, to such, successor. His legal representative is required to give bond for the faithful discharge of his duties, one of which, nominated in the bond, is, he shall, well and truly, do and perform all other matters aud things touching\u201d his administration, \u201c that are or may be prescribed bylaw, or enjoined\u201d on him \u201c by the lawful order, sentence or decree of any court having competent jurisdiction.\u201d One of the duties appertaining to his administration, prescribed by law, is, to account for, pay, and deliver to such successor the assets belonging to the estate of the deceased, represented by his testator or intestate, in his lifetime, and remaining in specie, when thereunto required by the probate court. If he fails to do so, he is liable to a suit on his executorial or administration bond. On the other hand, if the administration of the first executor or administrator terminates in his lifetime, it is his duty to account for, pay, and deliver to his successor such assets, under order of the court; and if he fails to do so, is liable to an action \u00a9n his bond. Section 45 says: \u201c The succeeding administrator or the remaining executor may proceed at law against the delinquent and his securities, or either of them, or any other person having in his possession any part of the estate.\u201d What delinquent is referred to in this section ? Manifestly he who failed to deliver assets in obedience to the order of the court, as prescribed by section 44, just preceding. If the first administrator be dead, the delinquent and securities referred to could not be the first administrator and his securities, because no action could be brought against him. As to the assets remaining in specie at bis death, he could not be considered a delinquent, because the law assumes no jurisdiction of a dead \u25a0 man, and requires nothing of him. His sureties have no right, and it is not tlaeir duty, to take charge and control of the assets, and they are powerless to prevent waste thereof. It is his legal representative who is required to account for and deliver the assets remaining in 'Specie, under the order of the court; and if he fails to do so, he is the delinquent, and his sureties are the securities authorized to be sued by section 45. If the assets have been lost, wasted or converted by the deceased administrator in his lifetime, the creditors, legatees, distributees or other persons interested, are alone authorized to sue on the bond of the first executor or administrator, and not his successor. Sections 44, 45 and 191, stand as a part of one and the same act of the legislature, and should be construed together. From them, construed as a whole, the conclusion that suit can not be brought on the bond of a deceased administrator by his successor, for assets remaining in specie at the time of his death, or for damages suffered by reason of the waste and mismanagement thereof since his death, is unavoidable.\nPlaintiff, in the amendment to her complaint, asked that the heirs and distributees of Skelton be joined and considered as plaintiffs in this action. These heirs and distributees, so far as shown by the transcript of the record here, did not appear and ask to be made parties, and were not made parties. Did plaintiff- have the right to amend by making them parties ? The Code says: \u201c The court may, at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party.\u201d This provision of the Code assumes that the plaintiff has a cause of action, and does not authorize the court in any case, where the plaintiff has failed to show any cause of action, to amend by adding the name of a party in whose favor a cause of action is shown by the complaint to exist, because such a proceeding would be practically instituting a new action, and forcing a party, at the instance of one who has no right to demand it, to commence an action when he does not wish to do so. Broad and liberal as the provisions of the statute of amendments are, we see no authority in them for such a proceeding. Pomeroy\u2019s Remedies and Remedial Rights, sec. 420; 4 Watte\u2019s Practice, 655; Van Syckels v. Perry, 3 Rob. (N. Y), 621; Davis v. The Mayor, etc., of New York, 14 N. Y. (4 Kern), 506; Van Duzer v. Howe, 21 N. Y. (7 Smith), 531.\nWe, therefore, conclude that plaintiff\u2019s complaint and amendment thereto, under any construction that may or can be placed thereon, fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action : that the demurrer thereto was properly sustained; and that there is no error in the proceedings of the court below.\nLet the decree of the court below be in all things affirmed."},{"case_name":"WILLIAM PIERSON, Plaintiff in Error, v. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, Defendants in Error","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/8594472\/","date":"1879-06-01","court":"New York Supreme Court","content":"Talcott, P. J.:\nThe return to the writ of error, in this case, brings up the record of the conviction of the plaintiff in error for the crime of murder in the first degree, by and before the court of Oyer and Terminer, of Livingston county, over which the Hon. Charles C. Dwight presided.\nThe murder was alleged to have been committed on the body of Leman Bradley Withey by the administration of arsenic. Rosetta Withey, the wife of the said Leman Bradley Withey, was jointly indicted with Pierson. Pierson demanded a separate trial- on the indictment, and he was separately tried. A bill of exceptions taken on- such trial, duly settled and signed, is returned as a part of the record, whereby, amongst other things, it appears that the counsel for the said Pierson interposed a challenge to the array of jurors who were summoned to try said cause. The substance of which said challenge is, that after the commencement of the said term of Oyer and Terminer, the court made an order requiring the clerk of the county to draw \u201c from the county box,\u201d and sheriff to notify thirty-six in number, of trial jurors, to attend the said term on the 25th day of February, 1878. That, thereupon, the clerk brought into court, jxom the clerk\u2019s office, the said county, box in which the names of the trial jurors for the county were deposited. That there was present in court, at the same time, the box in which was deposited duplicate ballots containing the names of all persons mentioned and returned as trial jurors, who resided in the town of Geneseo, in which town the said term of the court was being held. But the said county clerk did not bring in the third box, required by law to be kept by him, and to be presented at such drawing. That the said clerk, in the presence and by the direction of the court, drew from the said county box, brought in by him, the names of thirty-six in number of trial jurors, and made two lists thereof, one of which was filed in his office, and the other delivered to the sheriff, rvho notified the persons so draAvn to attend on the 23rd day of February. vThat, afterwards, on the 23rd day of February, the court made ano\\ther order to draw fourteen in number of trial jurors, in addition'' to the said thirty-six first drawn, also from the said county box, aW the same form was gone through as in tlie original drawing tif the thirty-six additional jurors, and the fourteen were ordered to be drawn and summoned to attend on the 25th day of February, and the same were in like manner drawn and summoned.\nThe third box was not brought into court by the said county clerk at either of the said drawings, and the challenge avers that the said \u201c clerk did not have in his possession, or keep the third box required by law in which to deposit the names of jurors who had served at the various courts held in and for the comity of Livingston, at previous terms, in accordance with the provisions of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d\nThe district attorney answered to the said challenge that the said additional jurors were in all respects duly and legally drawn, and prayed that the array of the said panel might be allowed by the said court.\nAnd, thereupon, it was proved on the part of the said Pierson, in substance, that there were only two boxes for jurors kept in the county clerk\u2019s office; one containing the names of the trial jurors, made up from the list returned by the supervisors, town clerks and assessors of the several towns of Livingston county, and the other containing the names of trial jurors, selected from the town of Genesco ; and that there was no box in the county clerk\u2019s office in which to place the names of the trial jurors who had served at previous terms; that only the two boxes first named wore produced in court at the time of the drawing of the said additional j urors ; that the list of names contained in the county box, from which the said additional jurors were directed to bo drawn, and which was brought into court, was made up in 18 7 5 ; and that a new drawing was to take place, according to law, in July, 1878 ; and that the names of jurors who had served at previous terms, since the lists were made out and certified in 1875, wore not presented in any box and could not be produced in any court. Thereupon, the said Court of Oyer and Terminer sustained the said challenge to the said array. And thereupon the prisoner's counsel withdrew the said challenge.\nChapter 16 of the Laws of 1871, providing for the drawing of additional jurors in any Circuit Court or Court of Oyer and Ter-miner, seems to have been repealed by section 1, subdivision 45 of chapter 417 of the Laws of 1877, known as the repealing act. The provisions of law, therefore, which governed the drawing of additional jurors, when the indictment in this case was tried, were sections 1050, 1058 and 1059 of the Code of Civil Procedure. ' By section 1059 it is prescribed that, in drawing additional jurors, the clerk shall bring into court all the boxes wherein ballots containing the names of trial jurors are deposited, and must, in the presence of the court, publicly draw from such box or boxes, as the court directs, the number of trial jurors specified in the order. The irregularity insisted on by the challenge was, that there was no box present containing the name of those trial jurors who had attended and served at previous terms.\nIt is only when the first box is exhausted, that the second box can be resorted to under section 1051. It does not appear in the case that the first box was exhausted, nor, but what the regular panel furnished a sufficient number of names, which composed the jury before which the indictment was tried ; and we apprehend that the challenge was sustained by the Oyer and Terminer from abundant caution, and not from any idea that any material irregularity in the drawing of the additional jurors had occurred, which could have resulted in any injury to the defendant.\nIt was held in Friery v. The People (54 Barb., 319) that the statutory regulations in respect to the drawing and summoning -of jurors were not made for the benefit of parties to trials by jury, and for the purpose of securing to such parties (in civil and criminal proceedings) an impartial array of jurors, but were made for I he purpose of securing an impartial distribution among citizens of the onerous duty of performing jury service, and that, hence, in the absence of fraud or misconduct, other than a failure to observe the regulations, the public only can complain that the regulations have been disregarded, and that \u201c a challenge to the array by a prisoner on trial will not lie for a disregard of the directions of the statute.\u201d\nThis case was affirmed in 2 Keyes, 424, m which the Court of Appeals held that \u201c any irregularity attending the drawing of jurors, which does not change the persons who are to compose the jury, does not tend to affect the rights of the prisoner, and will not be a good cause of challenge to the array.\u201d\nThe case of Friery was a conviction for murder.\nIn the case of The People v. Rawson (7 Wend., 417), it was held that the provisions of the statute are merely directory, and a neglect of its provisions is not, per se, sufficient for setting aside the verdict. In Ferris v. The People (35 N. Y., 125), the eame doctrine was reiterated in the case of a conviction for murder in the first degree, and also by the General Term of the third \u00a1lepartment in Gardiner v. The People (6 Parker\u2019s Crim. Rep., 157).\nBut, if there were material irregularity in the drawing of the jury, we think it was waived by the withdrawal of the challenge after the ruling of the court by which it was sustained.\nIt is provided by statute (2 R. S. Pt., 4, chap. 2, title 4, art. 2, \u00a7 52) that \u201c no indictment shall be deemed invalid, nor shall the trial, judgment, or other proceedings thereon be affected * * * by reason of any other defect or imperfection in matters of form, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.\u201d\nThe prisoner may waive any matter of form or substance, only such as may relate to the jurisdiction of the court.\nHe may waive triers on the question of the indifferency of a juror, and agree that the court may act as a trier. He may waive the plea of autre fois acquit. In fact he may plead guilty to the charge in the indictment. (Gardiner v. The People, 6 Parker Cr. R., 194; The People v. Mather, 4 Wend., 229; People v. Murray, 5 Hill, 468; Germond v. People, 1 id., 343; U. S. v. Rathbone, 2 Paine\u2019s C. C. R., 578.)\nIn Cancemi v. The People (18 N. Y., 128, 137) the following language is used with respect to waivers and consents in criminal cases : \u201c Effect may justly and safely be given to such consent in many particulars, and the law does, in respect to various matters, regard and act upon it as valid. Objections to jurors may be waived. The court may be substituted for triers to dispose of challenges to jurors. Secondary, instead of primary evidence, may be received ; admissions of facts are allowed ; and, in similar particulars, as well as in relation to mere formal proceedings generally, consent will render valid what, without it, would be erroneous. A plea of guilty to any indictment, whatever may be the grade of the crime, will be received and acted upon, if it is made clearly to appear that the nature and effect of it was understood by the accused. * * * But when issue is joined upon an indictment, the trial must be by the tribunal, and in the mode which the constitution and laws provide, without any essential change.\u201d\nIll the Cancemi Case the decision awarding a new trial was put clearly on jurisdictional grounds. The court had no power to pronounce sentence of death upon Cancemi, except upon his pica of guilty, or upon the verdict of a common law jury; and a jury of twelve men had not found him guilty.\nSo a challenge to the array may be waived by a challenge at the polls in a capital case. (People v. McKay, 18 Johns., 212.) We, therefore, think that by the withdrawal of the challenge to the array the prisoner waived all benefit thereof and expressed himself content with the jury as constituted, and cannot now raise any question as to the regularity of the drawing of the additional jurors, even if they had composed any portion of the panel by which ho was tried, which, however, does not appear.\nDuring the progress of the trial William H. Coe, a physician, was sworn as a witness on the part of the People. It appeared that he was duly authorized to practice physic, and that he had been requested to, and did, attend the deceased in his professional capacity. On the witness being inquired of by the district attorney concerning the various symptoms exhibited by the deceased, and what the witness had learned concerning the condition of the patient during the time of his attendance upon the deceased as such physician, the counsel for the prisoner objected to the evidence, on the ground that the information which the witness obtained, was obtained as a physician. That he (the witness) had no right to disclose it, and that the evidence offered was prohibited by the statute. The objection intended to bo raised by the counsel for the prisoner is founded on section 834 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and is as follows: \u201cA person duly authorized to practice physic or surgery shall not be allowed to disclose any information which he acquired in attending a patient in a professional capacity, and which was necessary to enable him to act in that capacity.\u201d\nIn considering the question thus presented it will bo assumed that the information, sought by the examination of the witness, was information acquired while attending the patient in a professional capacity, and that it was necessary to enable the witness to act in that capacity.\nBy section 836 it is provided that the last preceding three sections, which provide against the disclosure by clergymen, physicians, and attorneys and counselors, shall apply to every examination of a person as a witness, \u201c unless the provisions thereof are expressly waived by the person confessing, the patient or the client.\u201d\nSection 834 of the Code is substantially a rc-enactment of a similar provision in the Revised Statutes, and which was by the enactment of the Revised Statutes for the first time made a part of the positive law of this State. The reason of this enactment was in order that the fullest confidence might exist between the patient and'his medical adviser. The revisers, in their note to this section in which this provision is contained, say : \u201c The ground on which communication to counsel are privileged, is the supposed necessity of a full knowledge of the facts to advise correctly, and to prepare for the proper defence or prosecution of a suit, but surely the necessity of consulting a medical adviser, when life itself may be in jeopardy, is still stronger, and unless such consultations are privileged men will be incidentally punished, by being obliged to suffer the consequences of injuries without relief from the medical aid, and without conviction of any offence. * * * It is believed that the proposition in the section is so guarded that it cannot be abused by applying it to cases not intended to be privileged.\u201d (Revisers notes to part III, chapter 7, title 3, section 73 of the Revised Statutes.)\nSection 836 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacts only that the privilege created by section 834 is to apply to every examination of a person as a witness, unless the provisions of section 834 are expressly waived by the patient, which is in accordance with the opinion of C. J. Savage, as expressed in the court of errors on the appeal from the decision of the chancellor in Johnson v. Johnson (14 Wend., 637).\nThe exceptions presented in this case shows how mistaken were the revisers of the statutes of 1830, in supposing that the section was so guarded that it could not be abused by applying it to cases not intended to be privileged. Hero is a privilege designed exclusively for the benefit and protection of the patient which it is insisted, not without some colorable foundation in the language of the section in question, may be invoked to shield the alleged murderer of the patient from a disclosure of facts which might have a tendency to establish the commission of the murder.\nThe statute which prohibits a physician from disclosing the information acquired by him, in attending a patient in his professional capacity, has received judicial construction with infrequency, compared with the corresponding privilege in the case of coun.selors and attorneys, which having been established under the common law has, of course, had a much longer existence.\nIn the case of Hewitt v. Prime (21 Wend., 79), where the defendant, in an action for seduction, had applied to a practicing physician for drugs to produce an abortion upon a pregnant female, BronsoN, J., said, in regard to the admissibility of the evidence of the physician in behalf of the plaintiff, \u201c the witness (the physician) I think was not privileged. It is very doubtful whether the communication, made to him by the defendant, 'can be considered as consulting him professionally within the meaning of the statute, and it is certain that the information given was not essential to enable him to prescribe for the patient, if the daughter of the plaintiff should be considered a patient, in respect to the transaction.\u201d In Johnson v. Johnson (4 Paige, 460) the chancellor held, in an action for divorce, that the testimony of the physician of the husband, in regard to some material facts, information of which was obtained by the physician while attending the husband professionally, was illegal and improper, and ought not to have been read. The objection in this case was not made by the husband, but the physician himself declined to answer. The chancellor regarded the statute as not merely excusing, but as expressly prohibiting a physician from disclosing such information as having been obtained within the statute, and that such disclosure would be in direct violation of the statute.\nThe case of Johnson v. Johnson was appealed to the court of errors, where the decision of the chancellor was reversed (and not affirmed, as is erroneously supposed by the counsel for the prisoner). In the court of errors Chief Justice Savage, who delivered the only opinion which alludes to this subject, held that it was the privilege of the party and not of the witness, and like the privilege of an attorney in that respect might be waived by the party. The reversal of the decree of the chancellor can scarcely be held to have been on the ground that he had erroneously construed the statute, for Chief Justice Savage held that the evidence aliunde that of the physician was sufficient to establish the facts.\nIn the case of Allen v. The Public Adm\u2019r, where the probate of a will was contested, on the ground of incapacity and undue influence, a physician who attended the alleged testator, about the time when the will was executed, was objected to, as being prohibited by the statute, and it was held by Bradford, surrogate, that where, from the death of the person professionally visited, there is no one to claim the privilege, its assertion is of necessity excluded, and that if, after the probate or administration, the personal representatives or devisees might claim the benefit of the privilege in controversies with third persons, growing out of the estate, yet, before any grant of administration in a proceeding, as it were, in rem, to ascertain what is the will of the deceased, and who are entitled to succeed to his estate, and to represent him, there is no one, in fact, competent to assort such privilege, even if it survived ; and that the admission of the testimony of the physician was not the case of an attempted use of confidential intercourse, adversely to the interest or rights of a party, or those who take under him, or who, representing him, might equitably be considered subrogated to his privilege. (See case reported in 1 Bradford\u2019s Rep., 221), which case was affirmed sub nom. (Thayer v. Allen, Selden\u2019s Notes, 57; April, 1853.) Wharton, in his work on the Law of Evidence, speaking of the privilege in respect to communications with an attorney, says at sedfon 591 : \u201cThe privilege, it should also be remembered, is meant to protect the living in their business relations, and cannot be invoked when the question arises as to the intention of a deceased person in respect to the disposition of his estate.\u201d\nAs somewhat opposed to the proposition thus laid down by Mr. Wharton, may bo considered the case of Edington v. The Mutual Life Ins. Co. (67 N. Y., 185), which was an action brought by an assignee of sundry policies upon the life of William E. Diflendorf, which had been procured for his own benefit, and held by him up to the time of the assignment. In an action on the policies, it was proposed to contradict the statements made by tbe insured in his application for tho insurance, by calling as witnesses certain physicians who had attended him in his lifetime, which testimony was excluded as contrary to the statute. It was held that the exclusion was proper, and that the right to exclude such evidence survived to the assignee of the policies. The reasons for the inadmissibility of the testimony being that \u201cit is a just and useful enactment introduced to give protection to those who were in charge of physicians, from the secrets disclosed, to enable them properly to pi\u2019escribe for the diseases of the patient. To open the door to the disclosure of secrets, revealed on the sick bed, or when consulting a physician, would destroy confidence between the physician and the patient, and it is easy to see might tend very much to prevent the advantages and benefits which flow from this confidential relationship.\u201d The opinion of tho court also contains the further remark, that \u201c the statute in question being remedial should receive a liberal interpretation, and not be restricted by any technical rule.\u201d\nA similar question arose in Dilleber v. The Home Life Ins. Co. (69 N. Y., 256), in which an action was brought by a wife who had effected a policy upon the life of her husband, in which the court held the evidence had been improperly admitted, and reversed the judgment upon the authority of the previous case of Edington.\n\u2022 The reasons for the exclusion of evidence of this character are very fully stated by the court in the People v. Ira Stout (3 Parker\u2019s Crim. R., 670), which also lays down the proposition that, \u201c in the case of such a statute, it is peculiarly the duty of the court to look for its spirit, and be guided thereby in its application.\u201d It is one of the fundamental rules for the construction of statutes that it is tho duty of the courts to construe statutes according to the intentions of the Legislature, \u201c and whenever such intention can bo discovered it ought to bo followed with reason and discretion in the construction of the statute although such construction seem contrary to the letter of the statute ; * * * and a thing which is ivithin the letter of the statute is not within the statute, unless it be within the intention of the makers.\u201d (People v. The Utica Ins. Co., 15 Johns., 358.)\n\u201cIt is tho duty of the courts so to construe statutes as to meet the mischief, and to advance the remedy, and not to violate fundamental principles.\u201d (Hunt v. Cleis, 8 Johns., 41.) Statutes must be expounded according to the meaning, and not according to the letter. (Pillow v. Bushnell, 5 Barb., 156.)\nIn the Bank of Utica v. Mersereau (3 Barb. Ch., 528, 598), the chancellor said: \u201cThe seal of professional confidence has never been held to cover a communication, made to an attorney to obtain professional advice or assistance as to the commission of a felony, or other crime which was malum in re, and Bronsokt, J., in Coveney v. Tannahil (1 Hill, 33) uttered a similar opinion, saying : \u201c The privileged relation of attorney and client can only exist for lawful and honest purposes.\u201d\n~Wc think, therefore, that the purpose for which the aid of this statute is invoked in this case, is so entirely foreign to the purposes and objects of the act, and so diametrically opposed to any intention which the Legislature can be supposed to have in the enactment, so contrary to, and inconsistent with its spirit, which most clearly intended to protect the patient and not shield one who is charged with his murder ; that in such a case the statute is not to be so construed as to be used as a weapon of defence to the party so charged, instead of a protection to his victim.\nIn this case, it does not appear that there is any party now living who can claim to represent the deceased in relation to the subject-matter, unless it bo the People as parens patriae, so that, if necessary, the decision might probably be rested on the case of Allen v. The Public Adm\u2019r (supra). But, without assuming any narrower ground, we think that the decision that the statute does not apply to the case may well be placed upon the broad claim that the case presented is not within the spirit and intent of the statute, although within the letter. It is not unworthy of remark that the view we take of the effect of the statute excluding the evidence of physicians, as to information obtained by them in the course of their professional employment, is in harmony with what we suppose to be the general understanding of the object and effect of the statute, as shown by a constant practice in capital trials, especially such as involve an examination of a charge of poisoning, of receiving testimony of this description, without which, the ends of justice would be, in many instances, frustrated, and a statute, intended for a humane and benign purpose, be used as a protection and shield from the consequences of the deliberate perpetration of one of the highest crimes known to the law.\nAnother exception to the admission of testimony on the part of the People, and which is prominently pressed upon our attention, arose under the following circumstances. As it afterwards, and upon the cross-examination of Rosetta Withey, and the prisoner at the bar appeared, they both, soon after Withey\u2019s death, left Avon, the place where the homocide was alleged to have been committed, where they had resided, and by consent met at the railroad depot at Rochester, whence they proceeded to a hotel in Rochester where they passed the night, and thence proceeded together, with occasional stoppages, to Jackson, in the State of Michigan, the prisoner paying the traveling expenses of both parties. On the trial, Isaac Butterfield was produced as a witness on the part of the People, who, having stated that he resided in Jackson and was a Baptist clergyman, and saw the prisoner at the bar and the said Rosetta together at Jackson, in Michigan, on the 26th day of February, in the year 1877, was told by the district attorney. \u201c You may state what took place between those parties and yourself at the time you met them in Michigan.\u201d This was objected to, generally, by the counsel for the defendant. The objection was overruled and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The witness then proceeded to make a statement as follows : \u201c Answer. The parties came to my room and wished to be married. I administered the oath to Pierson, as he was a stranger to mo. The oath was, that he would correctly, according to his best knowledge and belief, answer the questions addressed to him relative to his eligibility to the matrimonial alliance he proposed. I then asked him if he knew any legal objection to his entering into this matrimonial alliance. He said he did not. I asked him his age, his residence, his birth place, his occupation, and the answers wore taken down as I asked the questions. Ho gave his name as William B. Pierson, present residence, New York, born in New York, age 32, occupation, a farmer. I asked the name of the lady and she gave it as Rosetta Withey, born in New York, present residence in New York, age 37. I then married the parties according to the laws of the State. In reply to the question whether he knew of any legal objection, he said, I do not. I performed the marriage ceremony according to the laws of the State of Michigan.\u201d\nIt had theretofore appeared that Pierson was married and had a wife and five children living with him at Avon, in the neighborhood of the place where the said Rosetta and her husband had resided, and that the situation of the said Pierson, in respect to his being already married and having the said children, was probably well known to the said Rosetta. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to this evidence because, as he says, it \u201ctended to prove that the defendant was guilty of perjury and bigamy.\u201d There was no motion made to strike out any portion of the statement made by the witness Butterfield, and no objection made to the statement in answer to the request of the district attorney, except a general objection. Prima facie, the request of the district attorney was entirely proper. It called for a statement of what took place between the witness and the parties. It was undoubtedly understood that the district attorney sought to prove the form of a marriage between the parties, and it is stated in the points of the counsel for the defendant, that the district attorney claimed the right to give the evidence, on the ground that it tended to prove a motive for the perpetration of the murder charged in the indictment, and that the motive imputed was, that the defendant had become possessed of an unlawful passion for Mrs. Withey, and that the murder was perpetrated to facilitate the gratification of his desires by the possession of Mrs. Withcy\u2019s person. Evidence of slight familiarities between the defendant and Mrs. Withey had been previously given, but not sufficient to establish, of themselves, the fact of any criminal intercourse. We have no doubt but that the evidence was proper to reflect light upon the motive, under pressure of which the crime charged in the indictment may be supposed to have been committed, and if the witness, in giving an account of the circumstances attending the form of marriage which he performed in Michigan, incidentally gave evidence tending to show that the defendant committed the two other crimes mentioned, especially in the absence of any more specific objection, and when the attention of the court was not called to such parts of the statement of the clergyman as may have been obnoxious to specific objection on the grounds stated, it was the misfortune of the defendant\u2019s case that the simple narration of h;s acts necessitated the proving of, at least, one of the other offences.\nIt is true that, on a trial for a felony, separate and distinct felonies cannot, generally, bo proved for the purpose of establishing the fact directly that the prisoner committed the offence for which ho is on trial, or for the purpose of raising any direct inference in the affirmative as to the principal issue, but such evidence-is competent for the purpose of proving the existence of a motive to commit the crime in question, in case where there is some apparent connection or relation between the imputed motive and the felonies proposed to be proved. Therefore, on a trial for felony, it is not a valid objection to evidence otherwise competent, that it would tend to prove the prisoner guilty of a different felony. (The People v. Stout, 4 Parker\u2019s Crim. Rep., 71.)\nIt does not lie with the prisoner to object, that the fact proposed as a circumstance is so heinous in its nature and so prejudicial to his character that it shall not be used as evidence against him if it bears on the fact in issue. (Id., 115.) There was no precise evidence of cohabitation between the defendant and Mrs. Withey given anywhere in the case, but the fact that the defendant went thro\u00fagh the form of a marriage ceremony with her was proper to be submitted to the jury, from which they might, judging by the ordinary conduct of human nature, have legitimately inferred a motive for the commission of the offence charged.\nThe counsel for the defendant requested the court to charge the jury, among other things, \u201cthat before the accused may be convicted, it must be proved that there was an adequate motive for the commission of this crime,\u201d to which the presiding justice said: \u201c I cannot charge you that m terms, without explanation. What is an adequate motive ? There is no adequate motive, intelligently considered in the light of the moral law, of the Divine law, even of the human law, there is no adequate motive for such a crime. And yet there are motives which, though not adequate for the commission of such crimes, are yet sufficient to lead men to the commission of such crimes, and they do it every day. Was there such a motive, operating on the mind of the person to whom it was suggested, sufficient to move him to the commission of the crime? I am requested to charge you that there is no evidence of the existence of such a motive prior to the death of Withey, whose death constitutes the corpus delicti of this crime. I cannot charge you that; that is a question for your consideration, which 1 submit to you. His actions after that time may reflect light upon the question what motives existed in his mind before that time. ' If, after that time, you find him hastening to a realization of the unholy passion, which, it is suggested, constituted that motive, it will be a question for you to answer whether that fact establishes to your satisfaction the existence of the motive before that time, in connection with all the other circumstances of the case.\u201d\nWo see nothing in the remarks of the presiding justice, in reply to these requests to charge, that can give any countenance to the objection of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that by this charge the jury were instructed, or in any way authorized, to use the evidence of a subsequently existing motive, as evidence going to establish the fact that the alleged and antecedent crime was committed by the defendant, or that a motive only, brought into existence at a subsequent period, might bo held by the jury to bear upon the question of fact, whether the prisoner was guilty of the antecedent offence. On the contrary, we think the charge was properly guarded against any misconception of that character, and was in every \u2022way proper and correct.\n\u201c Motive,\u201d said Judge Johnson, in People v. Wood (3 Parker\u2019s Crim. R., 681) \u201cis a minor or an auxiliary fact, from which, when established in connection with other necessary facts, the main or primaly fact of guilt may be inferred, and it may bo established by circumstantial evidence, the same as any other fact.\u201d The charge was, in our opinion, entirely in accord with the principles thus laid down.\nThe remark made by the presiding justice in the course of the charge, by which he called the attention of the jury to the circumstance that Mrs. Withey, in giving to Dr. Nesbitt and to Calvert, in the presence of Withey, a statement of what Withey had eaten and drank just before he was taken with the symptoms exhibited by him, and which, according to the theory of the prosecution, were occasioned by arsenical poisoning, she had omitted to state that Withey had drank a quantity of cider, and that as the statement had been made \u201c in the presence of the deceased, and would undoubtedly have been corrected by him if a false statement had been made, was not, in our view, objectionable. It was merely calling attention to a fact which appeared by the evidence, and even if it can be considered as the expression of an opinion that the statement by Mrs. Withey, that the deceased had partaken freely of cider at about the same time that he ate mush and milk, was probably an afterthought, did not prejudice the prisoner, as the question of what credit should be given to the testimony of Mrs. Withey, on the subject, was expressly left to the jury. (Jackson v. Packard, 6 Wend., 415; Durkee v. Marshall, 7 id., 312; Althorf v. Wolfe, 22 N. Y., 355.)\nThere were sundry other requests by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the court should charge the jury in certain language, which were declined, the court refusing to charge on the subject referred to in any manner different from what the judge had already charged. We think these requests were all properly disposed of. We have examined the entire charge carefully, and we think it was as full on the subjects involved in the case as was- called for, and free from any legal objection.\nThe case contained many elements calculated to strongly excite the prejudice of a jury and to interfere, to some extent, with that calm, deliberative and unimpassioned consideration of the evidence which is expected of a jury, to which the result of a capital case is committed, but we do not see that any legal error has been committed, and, therefore, feel bound to affirm the conviction.\nSmith and HaediN, JJ., concurred.\nThe conviction and judgment of the Oyer and Terminer of Livingston county are affirmed, and the case and proceedings are remitted to that court, with directions to proceed and fix another day for the execution of the sentence,"},{"case_name":"ESTATE OF WILLIAM C.

I give the property known as the California Theater property, being the property now subject to a lease to H. P. Wakelee, of the City of San Francisco aforesaid, which said lease is recorded in the Registry of Deeds at said San Francisco, liber 28, Leases, page 172, to which reference is had for a more complete description, and which said property is leased to said H.

Hinckley three thousand dollars each from the income of the said property under the lease aforesaid, or from the capital amount paid by the lessees under said lease for the property, if said lessees choose so to pay it according to the terms of said lease. [Wm. C. Hinckley, W. H.

And while I do not wish to set arbitrary limits to the wisdom, faithfulness, and discretion of my trustees, desiring, as I do, to foster Religion, Learning, and Charity, I wish to call their attention to the trials and afflictions of the industrious, striving, unfortunate poor, and especially to the aged, the infirm, and the lonely. I wish also to show my interest in good learning, and my sympathy [Wm. C. Hinckley and W. H. Chickering, witness] with honorable and striving young men, to set apart from the income of this fund the sum of Three Hundred Dollars per annum, to be known and designated as \u2018 The Hinckley Scholarship,\u2019 to be given to some worthy, talented, industrious, and needy young man, who is pursuing liberal studies, either in the University of the State, or in any other school, as the trustees shall r\u00edame.\n\u201c 3.

[Wm. C. Hinckley W. H. Chickering, witness.]\u201d\nThe question to be considered is the validity of the foregoing provisions, in so far as they do not relate to specific legacies to relatives of the decedent.\nIt is contended, on the part of the appellant, that the clauses above recited are in conflict with the policy of this State, as declared in the Constitution; that they are contrary to, and are rendered illegal by, the provisions of the Civil Code, which prohibit perpetuities, contrary to the chapter which relates to trusts, and to a section under the head of Trustees; that the trusts therein named can not be enforced, because the statute 43 Elizabeth, c. 2, has never been adopted in this State, and neither the act adopting the common law, nor the provision of the Constitution giving jurisdiction in \u201call equity cases,\u201d confers upon any Court in this State the peculiar jurisdiction with respect to charities exercised by the English Court of Chancery. It is further urged that the trusts could not be enforced in England, or, if so, only by employing the cy pres power, a power winch it is claimed can not be resorted to by any Court of this State.\nOn the part of the respondent it is contended that the trust may be established and enforced by a Court of Equity in California, as a \u201c charity;\u201d that it was the duty of the Probate Court to decree the \u201c Theater property\u201d to the trustees\u2014 whether the attempt to establish a charity was or was not valid\u2014since the trust to pay the legacies was good; and that one third of all the property of a decedent may be devised to charitable uses. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1313.)\nWe shall assume that the aforementioned propositions are necessarily involved. They have all been elaborately argued.\nA learned writer has said: \u201c The rule against perpetuities has been gradually established by judicial decisions, and affords a most notable instance of the nice adaptation of the principles of common law to the decision of a question which requires at once a due regard for the rights of persons and property, and a careful consideration of those larger principles of public policy so essential to the welfare of communities and states. For public policy is opposed to the perpetual settlement of property in families in such manner that it is forever inalienable, or inalienable so long as there may be a person to take answering the designation of some testator \u2022who may have died generations before. The first stand of the judges was to allow only those limitations which would take effect at the end of one life from the death of the testator. This was afterwards modified to include two or more lives in being, and running at the same time, \u2018 or where the candles are all burning at once;' for it is plain that such a space of time is only one life in being\u2014that of the longest liver. The next step was much debated; but it was finally settled that an executory devise might be made to vest at the end of lives in being and twenty-one years after, to allow for infancy of the next taker, who by reason of infancy could not alienate the estate. The statute of 10 and 11 Wm. III., c. 16, having provided that children en ventre sa mere, born after their father\u2019s death, should for the purposes of the limitations of estates be deemed to have been born in his lifetime, a further extension of nine or ten months was allowed for the period of gestation. The next step was to allow a period of nine months for gestation at the beginning of the term, as the life in being during which the term would run might be that of a child en ventre sa mIre. * * * It was finally determined that twenty-one years might be allowed as a term in gross, without reference to the infancy of any person, but that the period of nine months for gestation should be allowed in cases only where the gestation had commenced of some person who, if born, would take an interest in the estate. By such steps, by imperceptible degrees, and after two centuries of doubt and litigation, and unaided by legislation, the Judges framed and completed the great rule against perpetuities. Thus all future estates which arise by way of executory devise, conditional limitation, or shifting and springing uses, must vest within a life or lives in being at the death of the testator, and twenty-one years; and, in case the person in whom the estate or interest should then vest is en ventre sa mere, nine months more will be allowed; and all estates created as aforesaid, and so limited that they may not vest within that time, are void.\u201d (Perry on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 379, 380.)\nI. Trusts for perpetual charitable uses are not in conflict with public policy as declared in the Constitution of the State.\nOn the 13th day of April, 1850, the Legislature of California enacted: \u201c The common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, or the Constitution or laws of the State of California, shall be the rule of decision in all the Courts of this State.\u201d (Stats. 1850, 219; see Political Code, \u00a7 4468.)\n\u201c The great rule against perpetuities\u201d had been settled in England before the date of the \u201cDeclaration of Independence\u201d by the Colonies, before the first Constitution of California was adopted, and before the act above recited was passed. That rule\u2014at all events the whole of it except that portion which allowed nine months for an infant en ventre sa mere\u2014became part of the law of California, at least from the date of the act adopting the common law of England \u201c as the rule of decision.\u201d\nPrior to the adoption of the common law \u201cas a rale of decision,\u201d the people of this State had declared in the Constitution: \u201cHo perpetuities shall be allowed except for eleemosynary purposes.\u201d (Const, of 1849, art. xi, \u00a7 16.) This provision was renewed in the Constitution of 1879. (Art. xx, \u00a7 9.) It can not seriously be contended that this provision of the Constitution either prevents the Legislature from shortening the period within which estates must vest, or from making the law thus shortening such period applicable to trusts for charitable uses. In the absence of any legislation adopting the common law, it is probable that the courts of this State would go to the common law definitions to ascertain the meaning of the expression \u201c no perpetuities shall be allowed,\u201d as used in the Constitution. However this may be, immediately upon the adoption of the common law, it became necessary to construe the language of the Constitution, as being simply declaratory of the common law rule. The exception \u201c for eleemosynary purposes\u201d can not be held to enlarge the meaning of the prohibitory clause which proceeds it. The exception seems to have been added lest the words \u201c no perpetuities shall be allowed\u201d might possible be held to include perpetual charities. In a certain sense trusts for charities may be perpetuities, since they are not required to be limited as provided by the rule against perpetuities. But the perpetuities prohibited by the common law did not include trusts for charitable uses. It is a correct exposition of the rule of the common law to declare that by it \u201c perpetuities are prohibitedyet no legal mind would receive this as a declaration that trusts for charitable uses, although created to continue beyond the period fixed by the common law rule, were prohibited. We must suppose that the framers of the Constitution were familiar with the rule. If they had simply declared\u2014\u201cno perpetuities shall be allowed,\u201d the Courts would not have held the prohibition to have extended to charities, because the framers of the Constitution used the words of prohibition in view of the evils which the English Courts had sought to correct by the establishment of the rule, and in view of the effect and extent of the rule itself. The Constitution did not adopt a new rule, but expressly recognized one already existing elsewhere. The words of the exception, so far from indicating that it was the intention of those who made and adopted the Constitution to extend the prohibition to charities\u2014or that charities should be considered as perpetuities within the meaning of the rule of prohibition\u2014indicate precisely the contrary. In short, the Constitution adopted the common law rale, which never applied to charities, and is to be read as if it had been said: \u201c Perpetuities shall not be allowed, but let it be clearly understood that settlements for charitable uses are not perpetuities within the meaning of the word as used in the prohibitory clause.\u201d\nThe adoption of the common law left undisturbed the distinction recognized by the Constitution between prohibited perpetuities (including private trusts) and charities.\nThat the prohibition of the common law and Constitution \u2014as also that of any statute merely shortening the period within which, according to the rule of the common law, estates must vest\u2014extends as well to the creation of perpetuities through the medium of private trusts as by common law conveyances, can not be doubted. A \u201cperpetuity\u201d\u2014that is, that which is prohibited as such by the common law or statute\u2014will no more be tolerated when it is covered by a trust than when it displays itself undisguised in the form of a legal estate. (Perry on Trusts, 737, and cases cited; Thelluson v. Woodford, 4 Ves. 227; S. C., 11 id. 112; Hooper v. Hooper, 9 Cush. 122; Hawley v. James, 5 Paige, 445.)\nII. \u201cCharities\u201d are not prohibited by the provisions of the Civil Code which prohibit perpetuities.\nAs we have seen, charities are not included in the common law rule. It remains to inquire whether the rale prohibiting perpetuities has been extended to include charities by express statutory enactment.\nSection 715 of the Civil Code reads: \u201cThe absolute power of alienation can not be suspended, by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer period than during the continuance of lives of persons in being at the creation of the limitation or condition, except in the single case mentioned in section 772.\u201d Section 772 thus referred to is: \u201cA contingent remainder in fee may be created on a prior remainder in fee, to take effect in the event that the persons to whom the first remainder in fee is limited die under the age of twenty-one years, or upon any other contingency by which the estate of such persons may be determined before they attain majority.\u201d\nIt is difficult to believe but, had it been the intention that these sections should apply to trusts for charitable uses, they would have been differently worded, or that there would have been inserted an independent section clearly expressing such intention. The sections of the code prohibit limitations or conditions which may suspend the power of alienation beyond the lives of persons. Bearing in mind the object of the common law rule\u2014to prevent the perpetual settlement of property in families\u2014it would seem to be the evident purpose of the provisions of the Code, which limit the period within which estates must vest during the existence of living persons, simply to shorten that period as established by the common law. Accepting this as the real intent of the statute, full force and effect is given to the language employed; and the rule of the statute, like that of the common law, may coexist with and leave undisturbed the doctrines of the common law applicable to charities. We acknowledge the power of the Legislature to declare a different public policy, if, in the progress of our history, the perpetuation of trusts for charitable uses shall be found in any degree to conflict with the development of free institutions. But when, as is now the case, a wise and sufficient purpose can be attributed to the legislation which has been adopted, and the language employed does not necessarily import a larger purpose, we ought not assume that it was the intent entirely to overthrow a policy so thoroughly established and widely recognized. The statute simply recognizes principles of public policy\u2014\u201cessential to the welfare of communities\u201d\u2014which prohibit the perpetual settlement of estates in individuals and families. The common law rule as to perpetuities does not apply to charities. \u201cWhen either from circumstances extrinsic to a limitation or from the character of its subject-matter, a sufficient guaranty exists against any violation of the spirit of the law for the prevention of remoteness, their force and applicability, with respect to such limitation, cease so far as concerns the necessity for expressly conforming to the period prescribed by law. This consideration seems to apply to limitations * -s -x- \u00a30 charitable uses.\u201d (Lewis on Perpetuities, 663; State v. Griffith, 2 Del. Ch. 399.)\nStill, bearing in mind the evil which it was the object of the common law rule to prevent, the remarks of Taylor, C. J., in Griffin v. Graham, 1 Hawks, 130; S. C., 9 Am. Dec. 619, will tend to illustrate the meaning of the provisions of the Civil Code, so far as they are applicable to real property. The learned Chief Justice said: \u201cThe meaning which the law annexes to this term (perpetuity) is that of an estate-tail, so settled that it can not be undone or made void. As when, if all parties who have an interest join, they can not bar or pass the estate; but if by the concurrence of all having the estate-tail it may be barred, it is not a perpetuity. It is in reference to estates-tail that the word is used in the Bill of Bights; for there was no other estate that had a tendency that way. A condition not to alien annexed to a fee simple is void'; and the rules relative to executory devises, by which their duration is limited, had effectually checked their tendency to a perpetuity. In obedience to the declaration in the Bill of Bights, and to the injunction in the Constitution, the Legislature of 1784 abolished entails\u2014giving as a reason that they tended to raise the wealth and importanee-of particular families, and to give them an undue influence in a republic. This shows plainly that they designed to prevent the accumulation of individual wealth, and did not contemplate the possibility of any evil likely to arise from the establishment of a permanent fund for charitable uses. The probable effect of this was the reverse of what they meant to guard against, as it promised to increase the equality of the republic. It would afford the means of instruction to those who could not otherwise procure them; it would diffuse knowledge and morality among the class of society which stands most in need of them, and, by rendering them useful and efficient members, add to the strength and happiness of the community. Assuredly, then, property applied to these ends never entered into the common law notion of perpetuity; otherwise the objection would have been taken in Porter\u2019s Case, 1 Coke, 22, and in many others to be found in the books, where similar dispositions have been made. * * * I am thus led to conclude, that a perpetuity which the law would deem void, must be an estate so settled for private uses that, by the very terms of its creation, there is no potestas alieoiancli in the owner.\u201d\nIn other States, where the Constitution prohibits perpetuities; or where legislation has been had, adopting' the common law rule, or shortening the common law period within which estates must vest, it has not been supposed that such statutes interfered with the right to make perpetual settlements for charitable uses. Thus in Alabama it was provided, that gifts to others than wife and children must vest within the term of three lives in being, and ten years thereafter. (Code 1852, \u00a7 1309.) Yet the Supreme Court of that State, in 1862, held the doctrine to be settled that the Chancery Court had jurisdiction, by virtue of its original common law powers, without claiming prerogative powers, and without the aid of the statute of 43 Elizabeth, to uphold an executory bequest of money to the \u201cPilgrims' Rest Association,\u201d \u201cto be loaned out by Commissioners to be appointed by said association,\u201d etc. (Williams v. Pearson, 38 Ala. 299.)\nIn Connecticut it would appear that a Colonial statute of 1702 gave p\u00e9rpetuity to public charities. (Treat\u2019s Appeal, 30 Conn. 115.)\nBy statute of Michigan, the absolute power of alienation can not be suspended for a longer period than the continuance of two lives in being, with an exception like that found in section 772 of our Civil Code. (Com. Laws, 1857, c. 85, \u00a7\u00a7 15-26.) In Attorney-General v. Soule, 28 Mich. 153, it was held that a bequest \u201c for the establishment of a school at Montrose\u201d was so uncertain as not to bind the trustees to the application of the fund to public charity, and therefore no case was presented for interference by the State. But while the doctrine of charitable uses was considered and discussed, there was no suggestion by court or counsel that the statute prohibited perpetual charities. In Ohio (2 Rev. Stats., c. 42, \u00a7 1) no estate can be limited to any person or persons, except they are in being, or the immediate descendants of such as are in be ing at the time of making the deed or- will. In Ohio the general principles of the law of charities, as understood in England, have been repeatedly enforced, without any intimation that they were limited or controlled by any statutory prohibition of perpetuities. (Zanesville C. & M. Co. v. Zanesville, 20 Ohio, 483; McIntyre v. Zanesville, 17 Ohio St. 352; Williams v. First Presb. Soc., 1 id. 501.) By the nineteenth section of the \u201c Declaration of Rights\u201d in the Constitution of Arkansas, adopted in 1836, it is declared, \u201c Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a republic, and shall not be allowed.\u201d Nevertheless the Supreme Court of that State has said: \" It is not against public policy, or the spirit of our laws, for a man to donate to trustees a lot of ground, to be held and appropriated by them and their successors in perpetuity, for the use and benefit of a religious denomination as a place-of worship.\u201d (Grissom v. Hill, 17 Ark. 488.) In Kentucky a statute has substantially adopted the common law rule against perpetuities. (Rev. Stat., c. 80, \u00a7 34.) Yet it has there been held that the Court of Chancery possesses the powers of chancery in England, even such as are in the nature of prerogative. (Att\u2019y-Gen. v. Wallace, 7 B. Mon. 611.) This goes further than it is necessary to go in the present case, but certainly the statute could not have been considered as affecting the question. In Iowa, alienation can not be suspended for a period longer than lives in being and twenty-one years. (Code 1851, p. 1191.) But in Johnson v. Mayne, 4 Iowa, 180, and Miller v. Chittenden, id. 252, the Supreme Court seem to recognize the English law of charities, including the doctrine of cy pres so far as it is a judicial doctrine. In Vermont, where, as in Arkansas, the Constitution declares that a perpetuity shall not be allowed, it was considered, although the question to its full extent was not involved, that the Court of Chancery had full jurisdiction with reference to charitable bequests and uses. (Executors of Burr v. Smith, 7 Vt. 241; S. C., 29 Am. Dec. 154.) In Paschal v. Acklin, 27 Tex. 173, it was expressly held that bequests to charitable uses were not within the constitutional prohibition of perpetuities and entailments.\nIII. Such perpetual trusts, \"when relating to real prop erty,\u201d are not prohibited by title iv of part 2 of the Civil Code.\nIt is urged, however, that trusts for charitable uses arising out of real property, are prohibited by title iv of part 2 of the Civil Code. Section 847 declares: \u201cUses and trusts, in relation to real property, are those only which are specified in this title.\u201d And section 857 reads: \"Express trusts may be created for any of the following purposes:\n\u201c1. To sell real property and apply or dispose of the proceeds in accordance with the instrument creating the trust.\n\u201c2. To mortgage or lease real property for the benefit of annuitants or other legatees, or for the purpose of satisfying any charge thereon.\n\u201c3. To receive the rents and profits of real property, and to pay them to or apply them to the use of any person, whether ascertained at the time of the creation of the trust or not, for himself or for his family, during the life of such person or for any shorter term, subject to the rules of title ii of this part.\n\u201c4. To receive the rents and profits of real property, and to accumulate the same for the purposes arid within the limits prescribed by the same title.\u201d\nIt may not he improper here to ascertain what is intended by the third and fourth subdivisions of the section just quoted.\nA section of the Hew York statute, which was before the codifiers in this State, read as follows:\n\u201cExpress trusts may be created for any or either of the following purposes:\n\u201c1. To sell land for the benefit of creditors.\n\u201c2. To sell, mortgage, or lease lands for the benefit of legatees, or for the purpose of satisfying any charge thereon.\n\u201c3. To receive the rents and profits of lands, and apply them to the education and support, or either, of any person, during the life of such person, or for any shorter term, subject to the rules prescribed in the first article of this title.\n\u201c4. To receive the rents and profits of lands, and to accumulate the same, for the purposes and within the limits prescribed in the first article of this title.\u201d (Rev. Stats., ed. 1829, p. 728.)\nComparing the section of the New York statute with the corresponding section of our Civil Code, we find: 1. Prior to the amendments of 1874, the first subdivision of the section read like the New York law; and the second subdivision was substantially the same. 2. That the third subdivision of the New York statute has been changed by inserting the words \u201cpay them to,\u201d \u201cwhether ascertained at the time of the trust or not,\u201d and \u201cfor himself or his family.\u201d\nNone of the changes have altered the meaning of the third subdivision of the section. It had already been held that a trust to receive the profits of land, and \u201cto pay them over\u201d to the beneficiary, was valid under the provision authorizing a trustee to receive such profits \u201cand apply them to the use\u201d of any person. (Leggett v. Perkins, 2 N. Y. 297.) It had also been held, where there was a trustee \u201cto receive rents and profits, and apply them to the use of any person,\u201d that if the person primarily designated^ died during a trust term lawfully constituted in respect to its duration, there was nothing in the terms or policy of the statute which prevented the use from being shifted to some other object of the testator\u2019s bounty\u2014although such last person should not be in existence or known at the creation of the trust. (Gilman v. Reddington, 24 N. Y. 13.) And it had been further decided that any application of rents and profits, by way of trust, to the use of a man\u2019s family, was an application of them to Ids use, and if confined to the period of his life, and to a living individual, was not contrary to the statute. (Rogers v. Tilley, 20 Barb. 639.)\nThe section of the New York statute above recited (\u00a7 55) is found in article second, of title two, of chapter one of \u201c An act concerning the acquisition, etc., of property,\u201d etc. (Rev. Stats, p. 717.) The reference in the third and fourth subdivisions are distinctly to the first article of the same title.\nThe fifteenth and sixteenth sections of the first article, thus referred to, are:\n\u201c15. The absolute power of alienation shall not be suspended by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the creation of the estate, except in the single case mentioned in the next section.\u201d \u201c16. A contin-\ngent remainder in fee may be created on a prior remainder in fee,\u201d etc., (continuing in the same language as that employed in section 772 of our Civil Code.) These are followed by other sections regulating and declaring the mode in which estates may be limited, none of which authorize an extension of the power of alienation beyond the periods mentioned in sections 15 and 16..\nSection 37 of the \u201c First Article\u201d to which reference is made in the 55th section of the Hew York statute is-like section 724 of the Civil Code of California, with the difference that the Hew York law applies only to accumulations of the rents arising out of real estate, while section 724 relates also to the profits derived from personal property.\nSection 724 of the Civil Code reads:\n\u201c An accumulation of the income of property for the benefit of one or more persons, may be directed by any will or transfer in writing sufficient to pass the property out of which the fund is to arise, as follows:\n1. If such accumulation is directed to commence on the creation of the interest out of which the income is to arise, it must be made for the benefit of one or more minors then in being, and terminate at the expiration of their minority; or,\n2. If such accumulation is directed to commence at any time subsequent to the creation of the interest out of which the income is to arise, it must commence within the time in this title permitted for the vesting of future interests, and during the minority of the beneficiaries, and terminate at the expiration of such minority.\u201d\nThe references in subdivisions three and four of section 55 of the Hew York statute point' unmistakably to the provisions of law which prescribe the rules to which the subdivisions are subject; that in the third subdivision being aimed at sections 15 and 16 of article first, which prohibit perpetuities; and that in the fourth subdivision, at section 37 of the same article\u2014which prohibits the accumulation of the rents and profits of real estate.\nThe Hew York statutes have been always thus construed. The third and fourth subdivisions of section 55 have been read, by the Courts of that State, in connection with the sec tions of article first, prohibitory of perpetuities and accumulations. (Downing v. Marshall, 23 N. Y. 366; Lang v. Ropke, 5 Sandf. 363; Rogers v. Tilley, 20 Barb. 639.)\nThe reference in subdivision three of section 857 of our Civil Code to \u201cthe rules of title two of this part\u201d\u2014part two\u2014is sufficiently clear and is applicable to the rules found in that chapter which relate to the creation of estates. It may indeed be made to include section 715, which, although it takes its place in title two of the first part, is referred to in section 771\u2014a section of title two of part two. Section 771 is to be read with section 715, and was inserted from abundant caution lest it might be held that the latter section could be avoided, and a perpetuity created, by simply authorizing a change in the character of the property constituting the subject of the trust. Section 771 is merely declaratory of the law as laid down in Hawley v. James, 5 Paige, 444; S. C., 16 Wend. 163. \u201cA more power to exchange lands, whether such exchange is made directly, or by means of a sale and new purchase, is not a power to alien the estate, within the intent and meaning of the provisions of the Revised Statutes on this subject.\u201d (Hawley v. James, 5 Paige, 444.) Consequently such power would not obviate the objection as to alienability, within the rule against perpetuities. (Belmont v. O\u2019Brien, 12 N. Y. 402.)\nBut the reference to title two of part two in the fourth subdivision of section 857 of the Civil Code, is evidently a mistake. There is nothing in the title which in terms treats of accumulations of the rents and profits of real estate. The reference is to provisions which relate to accumulations of income from real estate, and it can be given force and effect by applying it to sections 722-726, in title two of the first part \u2014the only sections which contain the law on that subject, and which prohibit accumulations of income arising from real or personal property.\nIn thus construing section 857 of the Civil Code, our purpose has been broader than to point out an erroneous reference. It has included a design to prove that section 847 is applicable only to private trusts, and does not prevent the creation of permanent trusts for charitable uses. The references in section 857 are to provisions of the code, which, as we have seen, manifestly relate to the creation of estates to vest in persons or individuals in being, and to the accumulation of income for the benefit of such persons. Except so far as section 757 still further limits the period during which beneficial interests may be enjoyed, the title which treats of uses and trusts is but suppletory and correlative to the provisions of the code which relate to the creation of legal estates not violative of the rule against perpetuities. What has been said with reference to the object of the common law and statutory rule prohibiting the vesting of legal estates beyond a certain period\u2014the prevention \"of the dangerous enhancement of the wealth, power, and influence of particular individuals and families\u2014applies equally to equitable estates or-interests. We must assume that the Legislature had this object in view. We ought not to construe a statute, in which no direct reference is made to so important a subject as charitable trusts, as intended to prohibit charities; against which can be urged none of the objections, so pregnant of evil, which have been made against permanent' settlements in families. Besides, section 715 is included within part one of the code which treats of \u201c property in general,\u201d and, as we have seen, has no application to trusts for charitable uses. Here, as in New. York, \u201c trusts in personal estate are subject to no statu-: tory restriction; in other words, the Legislature has never attempted to define and enumerate the lawful occasions for such trusts.\u201d (Gilman v. Reddington, 24 N. Y. 12.) They stand, therefore, as at the common law, subject only to the statutory rule of section 715, and to the direction against accumulations. (\u00a7\u00a7 724,2220.) It would be a strange condition of the law, if while we could uphold a charitable donation of personal property\u2014the income to be perpetually applied to the support of the charity\u2014we must declare void a devise to a like object, upon the ground that the latter is annulled by the provisions of the code which, it is claimed, prohibit such uses and trusts. Of property thus dedicated, one kind is as effectually withdrawn from ordinary business as another; and there is nothing in our general policy or. laws which attaches a peculiar sanctity to land, or which either encourages or forbids restraints upon its alienation, not applicable to money or other property.\nIY. Nor does section 2221 of the Civil Code require that the individual cestuis que trustent, to be ultimately benefited by a devise or bequest to charity, shall be specified in the instrument creating the trust.\nIt is further objected that the trusts which the will attempts to establish do not comply with section 2221 of the Civil Code. The section is:\n\u201cSubject to the provisions of section 852, a voluntary trust is created, as to the trustor and beneficiary, by any words or acts of the trustor, indicating with reasonable certainty :\n\u201c1. An intention on the part of the trustor to create a trust; and,\n\u201c2. The subject, purpose, and beneficiary of the trust.\u201d\nIt is said that this section applies to all trusts alike.\nThe code does not in terms declare the distinction between express and implied or resulting trusts. But section 857 declares that \u201c express trusts\u201d in relation to real property may be created for certain purposes. Express trusts are put in opposition to those which are implied or resulting\u2014the latter being such as exist \u201cby operation of law,\u201d and the former such as are created or declared by instrument in writing. (\u00a7 852.) Section 2221 is found in a chapter which treats of \u201cTrusts\u201d in general. The first section of the chapter divides trusts into \u201c voluntary\u201d and \u201c involuntary.\u201d (\u00a7 2215.) Section 2221 is \u201csubject to\u201d section 852\u2014that is to say\u2014if a voluntary trust (using the words in the sense of the code) relates to land, it must be in writing. All trusts relating to personal property are left by the section to be proved \u201cby any words or acts of the trustor\u201d\u2014that is, by oral testimony. A bequest to charitable uses can only be by will in writing. It follows necessarily that section 2221 was not intended to apply to such, or any, bequests, or to devises for charitable uses.\nSection 2221 does not purport to limit the cases in which trusts may be created. It lays down a rule of evidence. Section 2220 declares:\n\u201c A trust may be created for any purpose for which a contract may lawfully be made, except as otherwise prescribed by the titles on uses and trusts and on transfers.\u201d\nAs we have seen, the title on uses and trusts does not prohibit charities, and \u201c transfers\u201d are conveyances of title from one living person to another. (\u00a7 1039.)\nY. Section 1313 of the Civil Code\u2014its effect.\nThe conclusion which we have reached with reference to the statutory provisions above considered is strengthened by section 1313 of the Civil Code. \u201c No estate, real or personal, shall be bequeathed or devised to any charitable or benevolent society, or corporation, or to any person or persons in trust for charitable uses, except the same be done by will duly executed at least thirty days before the decease of the testator; and, if so made at least thirty days prior to such death, such devise or legacy, and each of them shall be valid; provided, that no such devises or bequests shall collectively exceed one third of the estate of the testator leaving legal heirs, and in such case a pro rata deduction from such devises or bequests shall be made so as to reduce the aggregate thereof to one third of such estate; and all dispositions of property made contrary hereto shall be void, and go to the residuary legatee or devisee, next of kin, or heirs, according to law.\u201d\nIf the sections of the code relating to the period within which estates must vest or be beneficially enjoyed were clearly applicable to devises and bequests for charitable uses, it might plausibly be urged that section 1313 was intended only to impose a further limitation upon the powers of testators. In such case section 1313 might be said to mean that no bequest or devise for charitable uses should be valid (even for the.period during which the power of alienation may be suspended), unless by will executed more than thirty days before the death of the testator. But surely, in the absence of language making the provisions of the code relating to perpetuities clearly applicable to charities, much force should be given to the declaration of section 1313. It is there said that if a will settling real or personal property to charitable uses shall be made more than thirty days prior to the death of the testator, the devise or bequest shall be valid. We have seen the references in the title treating of uses and trusts to title two of part first, and title two of part second, and in the chapter treating of trustees to the provisions relating to uses and trusts and to transfers. It is worthy of observation that sec tion 1313 contains no reference to the provisions, of the code guarding against perpetuities or defining certain trusts. Hothing would seem more natural than that such provisions would have been referred to in section 1313, if the Legislature had supposed that they had any bearing upon the matter of trusts for charitable uses. Under the circumstances, the very silence of section 1313 may be treated as an implied legislative construction of the sections which are not referred to.\nSection 1313 of the Civil Code, like the statute of George II., c. 36, commonly called the mortmain act, recognizes the right to convey or settle to charitable uses, and was passed to prevent improvident alienations or dispositions, by languishing or dying persons, to the disherison of their lawful heirs. (See preamble to Statute Geo. II.)\nWe conclude that no statute of this State has prohibited permanent settlements to charitable uses.\nVI. Hew York decisions dependent upon statutes of that State.\nIn Hew York it was indeed held that a clause in a will, whereby was created a trust to executors to receive the rents and profits of real estate, and to pay them to certain named societies, during the lives of individuals named, was invalid, because not constituted as required by the section 55 of the Hew York statute above cited. (Downing v. Marshall, 23 N. Y. 379.) It was decided that, by the third subdivision of that section, the trust must be dependent on the life of the beneficiary\u2014\u201c during the life of such person, or for a shorter term.\u201d (Rev. Stats., p. 728.) This construction was given in view of, and the judgment of the Court influenced by, other sections of the statute, through which the charitable intent of the testator could be effectuated. The sections were 45, 47, 49, and 58. (Rev. Stats. N. Y. 727,728.) They prescribed that every estate in lands should be deemed a legal estate, \u201c except when otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 45. And see \u00a7 55.) That every person thereafter entitled in equity to possession and receipt of rents of lands should be deemed to have a legal estate therein, equal, in quality and character, to his beneficial interest. (\u00a7\u00a7 47, 48.) That, in case of a disposition of lands, \u201c whether by deed or devise,\u201d to one or more persons, for the use of, or in trust for, another, no estate should vest in such person or persons; and that every such disposition must be made directly to the person in whom the right to possession and profits is intended to be vested. (\u00a7 49.) That, where an express trust should be created for any purpose not enumerated in section 55, no estate should vest in the trustees; \u201c but the trust, if directing or authorizing the performance of any act which may be lawfully performed under a power, shall be valid as a power in.,trust, subject to the provisions in relation to such powers contained in article third of this title.\u201d (\u00a7 58.) Article third, thus referred to, classified powers, general and special. (Rev. Stats. 731.)\nThe sections and article above referred to were originally transferred in substance to, and incorporated in, our Civil Code. They were carefully eliminated from our law by the amendments which took effect July 1st, 1874.\nIn Downing v. Marshall, 28 N. Y. 379, the Court of Appeals of New York said that, by the revision of 1830 (Revised Statutes) the law underwent considerable change. But added: \u201cThere has been some misapprehension as to the character and extent of the change. All express trusts were abolished, except certain ones enumerated in the 55th section of the statute. * * * The system of trusts was a complicated one, and was believed to be attended with great inconveniences. These it was proposed to remedy, not by depriving men of the power of disposing of their estates, nor even by abridging that power, but by giving effect to such dispositions according to a more simple classification, so as to relieve this branch of the law from much useless refinement and perplexity.\u201d As to trust estates purely passive, the provisions of the statute vested the title in the beneficiary. Active, express trusts were defined in section 55. \u201cAll other express trusts were abolished; by which the revisers and Legislature intended simply that legal estates impressed with trust duties should be created only in the cases specified. The provisions of the statute were aimed against the attempt to create such estates or titles, but not against the duty, trust, or power. This is perfectly manifest from the provision which declares that if an express trust be created, for any purpose not enumerated * ' * * and the trust authorizes the performance of any act lawful under a power, it shall be valid as a power in trust. (\u00a7 58.) There was very wisely no attempt to enumerate or define the acts which might be lawfully done under a power, and in this respect, therefore, the law was subjected to no innovation.\u201d (Downing v. Marshall, 23 N. Y. 379.)\nWith reference to this case, further, it may be observed that the Court did not find it necessary to consider or discuss the subject of perpetual charities. The testator had not attempted to establish such a charity. By his will he directed his executors to continue in operation certain manufacturing establishments during the natural lives of two persons named, and to distribute the net annual profits thereof\u2014one half in equal shares to the American Bible Society, the American Tract Society, and the American Home Missionary Society, and the other half in supporting the Marshall Lifirmary.\nOf these the Bible Society, the Tract Society, and the Marshall Infirmary were incorporated associations. By a provision of the law under which the Bible Society and the Tract Society were incorporated, it was declared\u2014\u201cno devise to \u25a0 a corporation shall be valid unless such corporation shall be expressly authorized by its charter or by statute, to take by devise.\u201d The Bible and Tract societies were not expressly authorized, either by their charters, or by any statute, to take by devise. The Court held\u2014Denio, J., dissenting\u2014 that this fact was conclusive as to them\u2014equally conclusive whether the devises were attempted perpetuities or not; or whether they claimed to take a benefit under the will as by a technical trust, or through the power in trust conferred on the executors. As to the Home Missionary Society, it was unincorporated, and \u201c composed of a fluctuating and unascertained class of persons, having no legal capacity to take the gift.\u201d (Page 382.) There were, as the Court thought, no trustees and no ascertained beneficiaries, either as individuals, or as a class. Where perpetual charities are upheld, still there is no power in the American courts\u2014the Judges of which employ judicial powers alone\u2014in a case where the gift is vague and indefinite, and no trustee is appointed and the court is given no authority to appoint by the will. (Perry on Trusts, 731.) The Marshall Infirmary was authorized to take by its charter.\nIt was said by Porter, J., in Bascom v. Albertson, 34 N. Y. 619, that the decision in Williams v. Williams, 8 N. Y. 525, to the effect, \u201c the provisions of the Revised Statutes respecting trusts, perpetuities, and the limitations of future estates were not designed to, and do not at all affect conveyances or testamentary gifts to religious or charitable corporations,\u201d was reversed in Beekman v. Bousor, 23 N. Y. 315-318. But what is said in Beekman v. Bousor, with respect to the controlling influence or the statutes on \u201c Trusts,\u201d relates to a clause in the will there under consideration which seems to have been treated by the Court as an attempt to suspend, by means of a private trust, the power of alienation for a period not dependent on lives in being. That such was the understanding of the Court is rendered more apparent by an examination of the cases referred to in support of the proposition there laid down. They are: Hawley v. James, 16 Wend. 61, and Boynton v. Hoyt, 1 Denio, 53. In Hawley v. James it was held that the creation of a trust term by will to continue until the youngest of the testator\u2019s children and grandchildren, attaining the age of twenty-one years, shall attain that age, when the number exceeded two, was void under the Revised Statutes of New York. In Boynton v. Hoyt it was held that where the testator devised his estate to trustees to receive and apply the rents and profits in accordance with the third subdivision of section 55, but which trust was to continue until the testator\u2019s youngest child would, if living, attain the age of twenty years, the devise was void for suspending the power of alienation for a period not limited by the continuance of two lives in being at the creation of the estate.\nA gift to individuals or persons in their private capacity will not be charitable. (Thornber v. Wilson, 3 Drew, 245; S. C., 4 id. 350-357; Doe v. Aldridge, 4 T. R. 264; Doe v. Copestake, 6 East, 328; Morice v. Bishop of Durham, 9 Ves. 399; S. C., 10 id. 522.) In order that there may be a good trust for a charitable use, there must be some public benefit open to an indefinite and vague number; the persons to be benefited must be uncertain and indefinite, until they are selected or appointed to be the particular beneficiaries of the trust for the time being. (Perry on Trusts, 710, and cases cited.) It is no charity to give to a friend. * * The thing given becomes a charity when the uncertainty of the recipient begins.\nNor can we agree that the reasoning in Williams v. Williams, 8 N. Y. 525, is materially weakened by what was decided in President etc. of the College of St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford, v. The Attorney-General, 6 H. of L. C. 206-208. There it was determined simply that a statute of limitations, applicable to all trusts, was applicable to certain charities. Williams v. Williams, supra, did not turn upon the broad proposition that charities were unaffected by every general statute as to trusts.\nWhat is said as to the applicability of the statutes respecting perpetuities and trusts to charities in Levy v. Levy, 33 N. Y. 97, expresses the opinion of but three of the eight Judges of the Court of Appeals. Denio, C. J., and Campbell, J., dissented from the conclusion to which the Court arrived. Judges Davies, Brown, and Potter concurred only in holding that the trust failed under the laws of Virginia, for the reason that the whole scheme was founded upon the assumed validity of the devise therein of a certain farm in Virginia\u2014such devise being void as against the laws of that State. Judge Potter expressly dissented from that portion of the opinion which held the trust void under the laws of New York.\nVII. Law of Virginia.\nIt may be well, at this point, to examine the law of the State of Virginia with respect to trusts for charitable uses. The leading case is, Gallego\u2019s Executors v. Attorney-General, 3 Leigh, 487; S. C., 24 Am. Dec. 650. It is there said by Mr. Justice Carr: \u201cIn England, charitable bequests, where no legal interest is vested, and which are too vague to be claimed by those for whom the beneficial interest was intended, can not be established by a Court of Equity, either exercising its ordinary jurisdiction, or enforcing the prerogative of the King, independent of the statute 43 Elizabeth; and as that statute, if ever in force here, was repealed in 1792,1 conclude that charitable bequests stand on the same footing with us as all others, and will alike be sustained or rejected by Courts of Equity.\u201d\nJaney\u2019s Executor v. Latane, 4 Leigh, 327, seems to have been, decided on authority of Gallego\u2019s Executors v. Attorney-General. In Brooke v. Shacklett, 13 Gratt. 301, the proposition was repeated, that as the statute 43 Elizabeth constituted no part of the law of Virginia, charitable bequests were to be treated as standing on the same footing with other bequests. Seaburn v. Seaburn, 15 Gratt. 423, recognized as law Gallego\u2019s Executors v. Attorney-General, except as modified by subsequent statutes.\nIt will be seen that the Viriginia cases turned in no degree upon statutes of that State prohibiting alienations or defining trusts, but upon the broader principle that, independent of the statute of Elizabeth, Courts of Equity cannot establish charitable trusts when no legal estate vests, and the trust is so vague that its benefits cannot be claimed by cestuis que trustent. It is not for us to decide whether the principle was always properly, applied.\nVIII. Jurisdiction of Court of Chancery in England independent of statute of Elizabeth.\nWe are thus conducted to the consideration of the questions: Did the Court of Chancery in England, as part of its ordinary jurisdiction, have power to establish and administer charities, prior to the statute of Elizabeth? If so, what was the nature, and what were the limits of that jurisdiction?\nThe solution of these questions is perhaps peculiarly important here, since the statute 43 Elizabeth has never been adopted in this State.\nThe leading case in Virginia relies entirely on Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. 1.\nVIII a. Of Cases in the Supreme Court of the United States.\nBaptist Association v. Hart arose out of a bequest in the will of Silas Hart, a resident of Virginia, which was as follows: \u201cItem, what shall remain of my military certificates at the time of my decease, both principal and interest, I give and bequeath to the Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia annually, which I allow to be a perpetual fund for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination, who shall appear promising for the ministry, always giving a preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s family.\u201d\nPrevious to the death of the\u00bb testator, the Legislature of Virginia had repealed all English statutes, including 43 Elizabeth.\nThe \u201cBaptist Association\u201d had existed as an organized body for many years before the date of the will. After the death of the testator, it had received a charter from the Legislature of Pennsylvania, incorporating it by the name \u201cThe Trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association.\u201d\nIt was held in effect that no personal benefit was intended to the individuals composing the Association. They were continually fluctuating, and were not designated in the will. The intent was to constitute the Association, in its collective capacity, trustee. Held, further, that the Association could not take, because not incorporated at the decease of testator. \u201cAt the death of the testator there were no persons in existence capable of taking this bequest.\u201d Those for whose ultimate benefit the legacy was intended were to be designated and selected by the trustees. It followed, in the opinion of the Court, that as the Baptist Association was incapable of executing the trust, or even of taking it on themselves, the selection could never be made, nor the persons designated who might take beneficially.\nNevertheless, the question remained whether the character of the legacy, as a charity, would entitle it to the protection of the Court.\n\u201cThat such a legacy would be sustained in England is admitted,\u201d said Mr. Chief Justice Marshall.\nIt was contended, on behalf of the executors, that such a legacy would be sustained in England only in virtue of the royal prerogative, or of the statute 43 Elizabeth, and not in virtue of the rules by which a Court of Equity, exercising its ordinary powers, is governed; on the part of plaintiff, that the peculiar law of charities did not originate in, but existed before the statute of Elizabeth. The Court seems to have adopted the view of counsel for the executors, and proceeds to decide not only that charitable bequests, \u201c where no legal interest is vested, and which are too vague to be claimed by those for whom the benefit is intended,\u201d can not be established by a Court of Equity in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction, independent of the Elizabethan statute, but also\u2014appar ently, but, perhaps, only apparently\u2014-that they could not have been established by the English chancellor, even in the enforcement of the prerogative of the crown, independent of that statute.\nIt is not necessary to consider whether the last proposition was involved in the determination of Baptist Association v. Hart. There has never been any legislative attempt to devolve upon the courts of California the sovereign power which was employed by the king', as parens patricB, in the superintendence or administration of charities; even if, under ,our Constitution, powers not judicial can be conferred upon the courts.\nThe opinion of the Chief Justice in Baptist Association v. Hart, seems to have been concurred in by all the Associate Justices except Mr. Justice Todd, who was absent.\nIn Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors, 2 How. 127, however, Mr. Justice Story, in an opinion unanimously concurred in by the members of the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014after pointing out that the case differed in two particulars from Baptist Association v. Hart, inasmuch as, in the latter, there was both a donation to trustees incapable of talcing and beneficiaries uncertain and indefinite\u2014proceeded to say: \u201c There are, however, dicta of eminent Judges (some of which were commented upon in the case in 4 Wheat. 1), which do certainly support the doctrine that charitable uses might be enforced in chancery upon the general jurisdiction of the Court, independently of the statute of 43 Elizabeth; and that the jurisdiction had been acted upon not only subsequent but antecedent to that statute. Such was the opinion of Sir Joseph Jekyll in Eyre v. Countess of Shaftsbury, 2 P. Wms. 102; S. C., 2 Eq. Abr. 710, pl. 2, and that of Lord Northington in Attorney-General v. Tancred, 1 Eden, 10; S. C., Amb. 351; 1 Wm. Bl. 90; and that of Lord Chief Justice Wilmot in his elaborate judgment in Attorney-General v. Lady Downing, Wilmot\u2019s Notes, 1, 26, given after an examination of all the leading authorities. Lord Eldon in the Attorney-General v. The Skinner\u2019s Company, 2 Russ. 407, intimates in clear terms his doubts whether the jurisdiction of Chancery over charities arose solely under the statute of Elizabeth; suggesting that the statute has perhaps been construed with reference to a supposed antecedent jurisdiction 'of the Court, by which void devises to charitable purposes were sustained. Sir John Leach, in the case of a charitable use before the statute of Elizabeth (Attorney-General v. The Master of Brentwood School, 1 My. & K. 376), said: \u2018Although at this time no legal devise could be made to a corporation for a charitable use, yet lands so devised were in equity bound by a trust for the charity, which a Court of Equity would then execute.\u2019 In point of fact the charity was so decreed in that very case, in the twelfth year of Elizabeth. But what is still more important is the declaration of Lord Redesdale, a great Judge in Equity, in the Attorney-General v. The Mayor of Dublin, 1 Bligh\u2019s N. R. 312, 347 (1827), where he says: \u2018We are referred to the statute of Elizabeth, with respect to charitable uses, as creating a new law upon the subject of charitable uses. That statute only created a new jurisdiction; it created no new law. It created a new and ancillary jurisdiction, a jurisdiction created by commission, etc.; but the proceedings of that commission were made subject to appeal to the Lord Chancellor, and he might reverse or affirm what they had done, or make such order as he might think fit for reserving the controlling jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery as it existed before the passing of that statute; and there can be no doubt that by information by the Attorney-General the same thing might be done.\u2019 He then adds, \u2018 the right which the Attorney-General has to file an information, is a right of prerogative. The king, as parens patriae, has a right by his proper officers, to call upon the several Courts of Justice, according to the nature of their several jurisdictions, to see that right is done to his subjects who are incompetent to act for themselves, as in the case of charities and other cases.\u2019 So that Lord Redesdale maintains the jurisdiction in the broadest terms, as founded in the inherent jurisdiction of Chancery independently of the statute of 43 Elizabeth. In addition to these dicta pmd doctrines, there is a very recent case of The Incorporated Society v. Richards, 1 Dr. & War. 258, where Lord Chancellor Sugden, in a very masterly judgment, upon a full survey of all the authorities, and where the point was directly before him, held the same doctrine as Lord Redesdale, and expressly decided that there is an inherent jurisdiction in Equity in cases of charity, and that charity is one of those objects for which a Court of Equity has at all times interfered to make good that which at law was an illegal or informal gift; and that cases of charity in Courts of Equity in England were valid independent of and previous to the statute of Elizabeth.\n\u201c Mr. Justice Baldwin, in the Case of the Will of Sarah Zane (Magill v. Brown, Brightly\u2019s R. 346), which was cited at the bar* and pronounced at the April term of the Circuit Court, in 1833, after very extensive and learned researches into the ancient English authorities and statutes, arrived at the same conclusion in which the District Judge, the late lamented Judge Hopkinson, concurred; and that opinion has a more pointed bearing upon the present case, since it included a full review of the Pennsylvania laws and doctrines on the subject of charities.\n\u201cBut very strong additional light has been thrown upon this subject by the recent publications of the Commissioners on the Public Records in England, which contain a very curious and interesting collection of the Chancery records in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and in the earlier reigns. Among these are found many cases in which the Court of Chancery entertained jurisdiction over charities long before the statute of 43 Elizabeth; and some fifty of these cases, extracted from the printed calendars, have been laid before us. They establish in the most satisfactory and conclusive manner that cases of charities, where there were trustees appointed for general and indefinite charities, as well as for specific charities, were familiarly known to, and acted upon, and enforced in the Court of Chancery. In some of these cases the charities were not only of an uncertain and indefinite nature, but as far as we can gather from the imperfect statement in the printed records, they were also cases where there were either no trustees appointed, or the trustees were not competent to take. These records, therefore, do, in a remarkable manner, confirm the opinions of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Lord Morthington, Lord Chief Justice Wilmot, Lord Redesdale, and Lord Chancellor Sugden. Whatever doubts, therefore, might properly be entertained upon the subject when the case of the Trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association v. Hart\u2019s Executors, 4 Wheat. 1, was before this Court (1819), those doubts are entirely removed by the late and more satisfactory sources of information to which we have alluded.\u201d (Vidal v. Girard, 2 How. U. S. 194-196.)\nThat Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors was believed by Mr. Justice Daniel to have derived the judicial power of Courts of Equity with respect to charities from the common law, independent of the statute of Elizabeth, is sufficiently manifest from his remarks when concurring in the judgment in Fontaine v. Ravenel, 17 How. 369.\nIn that case it was held\u2014the testator having willed that his executors and trustees \u201c should dispose of the residue of his property for the use of such charitable institutions in Pennsylvania and South Carolina as\"they or he may deem most beneficial to mankind,\u201d and no appointment of the charity having been made during the life-time of the trustees\u2014that the charity could not be carried out by the employment of ordinary equitable powers.\nIn concurring in the judgment Chief Justice Taney and Mr. Justice Daniel differed. The former argued that whatever jurisdiction was exercised in cases of charities prior to the statute of Elizabeth, was exercised in virtue of the prerogative power and not as a part of the jurisdiction of Chancery as a Court of Equity. The latter, while freely admitting that the United States Courts are vested with no prerogative power, was equally confident that the Court of Chancery in England, apart from the prerogative and from the statute of Elizabeth, could take jurisdiction of charities where the charitable objects were not defined with perfect precision.\nThe case itself may safely be brought within the established principle, that, if an estate is given to trustees to be applied to such charitable purposes as they in their discretion shall judge best, and the trustees die without naming the beneficiaries, the Court will be governed by the apparent intent of the donor in determining whether it can appoint new trustees. If it is determined that a peculiar personal trust and confidence were intended new trustees will not be appointed. (Loring v. Marsh, 2 Cliff. 469; S. C., 6 Wall. 337; Marsh v. Renton, 99 Mass. 132.) In such cases the appointment of new trustees is refused when it appears from the will that the testator intended that none but the persons by him named should be intrusted with the power.\nIn Ould v. Washington Hospital, 95 U. S. 309, the Supreme Court of the United States say, that the statute of Elizabeth neither increased nor diminished the pre-existing Equity jurisdiction.\nVIII. b. Of cases in the Courts of the several States.\nIt is said by Mr. Perry: \u201c Courts of Equity in- the various States where they are not prohibited by statutes, exercise an original, inherent jurisdiction in Equity over charities, applying to them the rules of Equity, together with such other rules applicable to charities, as Courts of Equity may exercise under the constitutions and laws of the several States; and the Courts do this by virtue of their inherent powers, without reference to the question whether the statute has been technically adopted in their States.\u201d (Perry on Trusts, 694.)\nIn Jackson v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 574, Gray, J., clearly points out the distinction between the two sorts of powers, to describe which the term cy pres has been used in the books; the one kind being employed under the sign manual of the crown, the other under the general jurisdiction in Equity. The cases 'in which the disposition of a charity is held to be in the crown by sign manual, are of two classes: the first, of bequests to particular uses charitable in their nature, but illegal; and the second, of gifts of property to charity generally, without any trust interposed. In neither of these classes is exercised a judicial power of expounding and carrying out the testator\u2019s intention, but a prerogative power of ordaining what the testator has failed to express. As we have seen, the Courts of California can employ only judicial powers.\nThe learned Justice, in the case last cited, proceeds: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to superintend the administration and decree the performance of gifts to trustees for charitable uses, of a kind stated in the gift, stands upon different grounds; and is part of its Equity jurisdiction over trusts, which is shown by abundant evidence to have existed before the passage of the statute oUch^ritable uses.\u201d He fortifies his position by an imposing array of English and American cases. He adds, \u201c that it is well \u00a1settled, that, when a gift is made to trustees for a charitable purpose, the general nature of which is clearly pointed out, and which is lawful and valid at the time of the death of the testator, and no intention is expressed to limit it to a particular institution or mode of application, and afterwards, either by change of circumstances, the scheme of the testator becomes impracticable, or by change of law becomes illegal, the fund having once vested in charity, does not go the heirs at law as a resulting trust, but is applied by the Court of Chancery, in the exercise of its jurisdiction in Equity, as near the testator\u2019s particular directions as possible, to carry out his general charitable intent.\u201d (P. 580.)\nWe are not called upon to exercise the power cy pres, even as a judicial power. But surely the assertion of jurisdiction to employ the power, judicially, includes to the full an assertion of jurisdiction to recognize and declare valid, devises and bequests of the character mentioned.\nThe opinion in Jackson v. Phillips is further valuable as containing a succinct and exhaustive definition of charities as the word is to be employed in American Courts of Equity. \u201cA charity is a gift, to be applied consistently with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their minds and hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them to establish themselves in life, by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works, or otherwise lessening the burdens of governments.\u201d\nIn Paschal v. Acklin, 27 Texas, 173, a trust to charitable uses\u2014the beneficiaries being designated in general and collective terms\u2014was broadly upheld and maintained. In Missouri it was held that the jurisdiction of Courts of Equity over charitable uses and devises was not grounded upon the statute of Elizabeth, but upon the common law. (Chambers v. St. Louis, 20 Mo. 543.)\nIn Ohio, a residuary clause in a will: \u201c The remainder of my estate I do hereby give to the poor and needy, and fatherless,\u201d etc., of two townships named, \u201c to such poor as are not able to support themselves, to be divided as my executors may deem proper, without any partiality,\u201d etc.: Held, that the Court of Equity, upon general principles, independently of the statute of charitable uses (43 Elizabeth), had power to enforce the trust. (Landis v. Wooden, 1 Ohio St. 160.)\nIn Maine it was said by the Supreme Court: \u201c The better opinion of the most eminent jurists in England and this country, is, that a donation to charitable uses could be carried into effect in Chancery, without the aid of the statute of Elizabeth.\u201d (Preachers\u2019 Aid Society v. Rich, 45 Me. 559; and see there cited, Burbank v. Whitney, 24 Pick. 146.)\nIn Illinois it would seem to have been held that the intention of the donor of a charity will control, where trustees have been named, unless it is impracticable precisely to carry out such intention, and in the latter case that the doctrine of cy pres will be applied; and this without deciding that the statute of Elizabeth was part of the law of that State. (Gilman v. Hamilton, 16 Ill. 225.) In McCord v. Ochiltree, 8 Blackf. 15, it is said that the principles of the statute of Elizabeth would be applied in Indiana. After saying, further, that if it had been the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States when Baptist Association v. Hart was decided \u2014as it was subsequently declared to be its opinion in Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors\u2014that Chancery in England had an inherent jurisdiction over charities independent of the statute of Elizabeth, there could be no doubt that the legacy of Hart\u2019s will would have been sustained as a charity\u2014added: \u201cOur opinion is that the legacy under consideration, though void at law for the want of trustees capable, at the time of the death of the testator, of talcing or executing the trust, and on account of the vague indication of the objects of the charity, is valid as a charity, both in reference to the statute of Elizabeth, and to the law of charities in a Court of Equity as it stood before the passage of that act.\u201d It was decided by the Supreme Court of Georgia that the American Colonization Society was not competent to execute a certain trust for the benefit of enfranchised slaves; but as the latter were capable of taking, the Chancellor would appoint other persons to carry the trust into effect. The statute of Elizabeth was not referred to as conferring jurisdiction. (Walker v. Walker, 25 Ga. 420.) Williams v. Pearson, 38 Ala. 299, determines, that, in Alabama, the doctrine is settled, that the Chancery Court has jurisdiction, by virtue of its original, common law powers, without claiming prerogative powers, and without the aid of the statute of 43 Elizabeth, to uphold bequests to charitable uses, where an ascertainable object, recognized as charity, is designated by the testator in general or collective terms, although no trustee is appointed by him, or the trustee appointed is incapable of taking the legal interest.\nChancellor Kent doubted whether the English system of charities was to be referred exclusively to the statute of Elizabeth, and was of opinion that the weight of the English decisions was in favor of an original and necessary jurisdiction in Chancery. (2 Kent\u2019s Com. 3d ed. 2877.)\nThe citations showing an enlarged jurisdiction hi Courts of Equity in this country, which does not depend upon the English statute, might be multiplied. (See inter alia, Zanesville C. & M. Co. v. Zanesville, 17 Ohio St. 352; Johnson v. Mayor; Miller v. Chittenden; Ex\u2019rs Burr v. Smith, 7 Vt, 241; S. C., 29 Am. Dec. 154.)\nVIII c. Of Hew York cases.\nThe case of Williams v. Williams, 8 N. Y. 528, has been so severely criticised that it may be well to inquire, with some particularity, what was decided by it, and how far the propositions there laid down are sustained by rulings elsewhere, to which reference has already been had.\nOne of the legacies there considered was to a religious corporation, which, by the statute in force when it was organized, and prior to the enactment of the Revised Statutes, was authorized to purchase and hold real and personal estate to a limited amount; an amount which was not exceeded by the bequest. It was contended that this legacy was illegal, as creating a perpetuity contrary to the provision of the Revised Statutes, which prohibited the suspension of the absolute ownership of personal property for a longer period than two lives in being. (1 Rev. Stat. 773, \u00a7 1.) The Court proceeds to show that by fair construction of the act concerning religious corporations, corporations under it were, before the Revised Statutes, authorized to hold real and personal property in perpetuity; and, this much established, finds that the authority was not taken away by the Revised Code. The Court said: \u201cIt has been laid down that the law will not allow the exposition of a statute to revoke and alter, by construction of general words, any particular statute where the words may have their proper operation without it. Dwarris on Stat., ed. 1846, p. 532, and cases cited. * * * The rule deduced by Mr. Dwarris, from an examination of the authorities, is, that 'where the intention of the Legislature is not apparent to that purpose, the general words of another and later statute shall not repeal the particular provisions of the former one.\u2019 (Dwarris on Stat., p. 514.)\u201d Other reasons are urged why the section of the Revised Statutes was not applicable to the vesting of estates for charitable uses in corporations previously authorized to take to the particular use by the law of their charter. The other gift, considered in Williams v. Williams, was to Zophan B. Oakley and others, trustees, and their successors, of six thousand dollars, to be loaned, etc., and the interest to be perpetually expended in supporting an academy for the instruction of the children of the poor, etc.\nA line of succession through the fluctuating and uncertain class, \u201cthe children of the poor,\u201d not being known to theordinary rules of law, could not, says the Court, be made the channel for the perpetual transmission of the beneficial ownership of property, unless by force of that peculiar system of law, known in England under the name of charitable uses. It was objected to this bequest that in its nature it called for, and the provisions of the will assumed to create, a perpetuity. \"It was admitted that if the Revised Statutes applied to gifts for charitable purposes, the objection was fatal to the bequest. But according to English law, conveyances, devises, and bequests for the support of charity or religion, though defective for want of such grantees or donees, as the rules of law require in other cases, would (when not within the purview of the mortmain act) be supported and established in the Court of Chancery. (Case of Christ Church, Cambridge, 1 Wm. Bl. 90; Moggredge v. Thackwell, 7 Ves. 36.) The learned Judge (Denio, J.) adds: \u201cHaving adopted the common law of England, so far as it was applicable to our circumstances, and conformable to our institutions, the law of charitable uses is in force here, .unless, first, it was established by an English statute which has been abrogated; or, 'secondly, unless there is something in the system repugnant to our form of government; or, thirdly, unless it can be shown' by the history of our colonial jurisprudence that it was not in force here prior to the Revolution; or, lastly, unless it has been abolished by the Revised Statutes.\u201d\nThe opinion then proceeds to set forth an abstract of the statute 43 Elizabeth, c. 4. To the point that the peculiar law of charities was known and recognized, before the statute, are cited McCartee v. Orphan Asylum, 9 Cow. 437; S. C., 18 Am. Dec. 576; Ex\u2019rs of Burr v. Smith, 7 Vt. 241; S. C., 29 Am. Dec. 154; Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 How. 127, and Story\u2019s Comm, on Eq., \u00a7 1136 et seq. It is said: \u201c The statute of charitable uses was not introductory of any new principles.\u201d And, in another place: \u201cThe whole object of the statute seems to have been to provide a remedy against the abuses of charities. That form has been long since abandoned, and relief in that class of cases is now sought under the ordinary forms of justice in use in the Court of Chancery. The present English doctrine of charities does not, therefore, depend upon the statute, so far as the course of proceeding is concerned; for nothing could well be more dissimilar than the two modes. It can not be said that the existence of charitable gifts originated in the statute, for the preamble shows- that the object in passing it was to reach gifts already in existence; to redress breaches of trust which had been committed by trustees under donations theretofore made.\u201d And, again (quoting from Shelford, 278): \u201c The general proceeding, in the case of charities, has been for many years past by the old mode of information,\u201d etc.\nThe statute of Elizabeth, together with the statute 9 Geo. II., c. 36, had, at an early day, been repealed by the Legislature of New York. But the Court finds sufficient reasons for the repeal of the statute of Elizabeth in the circumstance that our political system knows of no dioceses, nor of bishops, to whom or to whose chancellors commissions could issue; and concludes that from the repeal no inference can be drawn hostile to an equitable jurisdiction independent of the statute. \u201c The most which can be said is, that we 'repealed an obsolete statute providing one mode of enforcing them (charities), which was inapplicable to the situation of the country.\u201d (P. 546.) From the repeal of the statute of mortmain the court infers simply an intention to give the greatest scope to the founding and endowing of institutions and trusts for promoting education and religion.\nIt is impossible to withhold our admiration for the clearness of mental vision and precision of language which the opinion in Williams v. Williams displays.\nThe learned Court admits that the doctrine of oy pres, so far as it was based upon the intervention of the King, has no place in the New York law. \u201c The reason is that we have no magistrate clothed with the prerogatives of the crown, and our Courts of Justice are intrusted only with judicial authority.\u201d\nThe views of the Court in Williams v. Williams, as to the derivation of the powers of Courts of Equity, are supported by Chancellor Kent in Coggeshall v. Pelton, 7 Johns. Ch. 292; S. C., 11 Am. Dec. 471, and by other earlier decisions in New York.\nIt had also been held that a bequest to a corporation not authorized to take by devise, and excepted from the statute of wills, was invalid. Here was a statutory inhibition. (McCartee v. Orphan Asylum, 9 Cow. 437; S. C., 18 Am. Dec. 576.)\nIn an able argument, .too long for recital, the Court proceeds to show that the provisions of the Revised Statutes of New York against perpetuities had no application to the bequest under consideration. It is perfectly certain that the law of charitable uses in England was never understood to be subject to the law against perpetuities; but on the contrary, it formed a well-settled exception to the operation of that law. The Revised Statutes were enacted with a constant reference to the then existing law. Changes were not made-for the mere purpose of innovation, but with a steady eye to the maxim which enjoins a strict attention to \u201cthe old law, the mischief and the remedy.\u201d The old law was well defined: Any number of lives might be selected to which the evidence would apply, and the estate might be rendered inalienable until the last survivor should die, and for more than twenty-one years afterwards. \u201c What the Legislature undertook to do was simply to shorten the period of suspension. * * * To limit charitable trusts, which in their nature involve the idea of indefinite continuity, by two lives in being, is substantially to abrogate themand this, remarks Denio, J., \u201cI am sure would have been done by express and unequivocal language, had it been intended to do it at all.\u201d (P. 557.)\nIt has been averred that the case of Williams v. Williams has been completely overturned by the subsequent decision in Bascom v. Albertson, 34 N. Y. 584. Even if this be the case within the limits of the State where that decision was rendered, the circumstance can not be considered here as weakening the argument which supported the previous judgment. But in Bascom v. Albertson much stress is laid upon the alleged fact that, at the period when the statute of Elizabeth was repealed in New York, it was universally supposed that the jurisdiction in England depended upon the statute; therefore, when the Assembly repealed the statute in 1788, it must have intended to repeal the whole system of charitable uses.\nWhat is said in Bascom v. Albertson with reference to the fact, that, since the repeal of the statute, a system has grown up in New York under which donations to charitable uses may be made to corporations; and the inference, from thence, of a legislative construction that the English system of charities came to an end upon the repeal of the statute\u2014is hardly satisfactory. The only inference that would seem fairly deducible from statutory enactments, authorizing religious or other corporations, to take by devise or bequest, to a limited amount, for religious or charitable uses, is that, in the opinion of New York legislators, the danger is not to be apprehended in this country which the English rule and statutes of mortmain were intended to guard against. The point was not overlooked by Mr. Justice Denio in Williams v. Williams. He there said: \u201c There are so many reasons why it might be desirable to enable donors to place their donations on a different footing from that on which they would stand under what I supposed to be the existing law of charitable uses, that I do not think any inference unfavorable to the existence of that law can fairly be drawn.\u201d \u201cThe creation of corporations for religious and charitable purposes, which abound in the statute-books, provide to a certain extent for the same object as charitable uses; but it would be a violent inference to say that they disprove the existence of any other method of hold ing or administering charitable funds.\u201d (Williams v. Williams, 8 N. Y. 557.)\nIn view of many early cases in New York, deciding that the courts had full jurisdiction over charitable bequests, and of the law as recognized in other States with reference to the subject, Mr. Perry\u2014in a spirit of moderation and decorum\u2014 criticises the ruling in Bascom v. Albertson, saying: \u201c Does the new system carry out the intention of charitable donors with more efficiency than did the old and tried system, which had grown up with time, and had been modified by the wisdom of so many judges, and still satisfies the wants of so many States ?\u201d And, with reference to the condition of the law in New York, says: \u201c The cases thus far decided evince great learning, research, and ability; but there seems to be a want of confidence in the stability of the system, and a want of agreement both among lawyers and judges; so that the whole matter is yet in a transition state. If certainty is an element of security and safety in the law, the attempt to substitute one system for another has as yet only reached the point of rendering both systems uncertain \u201d (Note to c. 28, Perry on Trusts.)\nVIII. d. Conclusion herein.\nOur conclusion upon this branch of the case, is, that Courts of Equity in this State have jurisdiction, derived from the English common law, independent of the statute of Elizabeth, to establish and enforce charities, when trustees competent to take the legal estate are named, and the class to be benefited, and the individuals to be designated by the trustees, are capable of ascertainment. Further than this it is not necessary to go in the present case.\nIS. Even if the Court of Chancery in England were limited to the enforcement, as charities, of trusts for such purposes as are enumerated in the statute of Elizabeth, the Courts of Equity in California would possess as ample judicial power with respect to such charities as the English Chancery except where restricted by the Constitution.\nEven if we were driven to the statute of Elizabeth as the Source from which the English Court of Chancery originally derived its jurisdiction in cases of charities, it would be worthy of consideration whether the Superior Courts, and former District Courts, did not possess the jurisdiction. If so, it would follow as a necessary consequence, that it was within the province of the Probate Court, incidentally to its general jurisdiction, to settle the estates of deceased persons, to recognize, as entitled to a distributive share of an estate, the trustees named in such valid devises and bequests. The statute of Elizabeth has neither been adopted nor in terms repealed by the Legislature of this State. The system of procedure provided in it is totally inapplicable to our social or political condition. But the English Court of Chancery has long abandoned the machinery of that statute. Its definitions and principles are indeed very frequently resorted to, and it might be admitted,for our present purpose, that nothing can judicially be declared to be a charity in England which is not enumerated in the statute, or which does not come within the \u201c anal-, ogies\u201d of the statute. (Morice v. Bishop of Durham, 9 Ves. Jr. 399.) The Equity jurisdiction, such as it was, and as distinguished from the prerogative power, had been established many years before the adoption of the first Constitution of California. The jurisdiction, as to the remedy, had been established independent of, and, in a certain sense, without reference to the statute; since the modes of the statute had not only not been adhered to, but had fallen into absolute desuetude. The former Constitution of this State declared that the jurisdiction of the District Courts should extend \u201c to all cases in Equity.\u201d (Const. 1849, art. vi, \u00a7 6.) The same jurisdiction is conferred upon the Superior Courts by the present Constitution. (Art. vi, \u00a7 5.) It might be said, then, that the jurisdiction of our Courts in Equity is to be tested by reference to the jurisdiction actually exercised by the Court of Chancery in England when our Constitution was adopted, except so far as the employment of such jurisdiction may conflict with provisions of the present Constitution, or with the Constitution of the United States; or is inapplicable\u2014the genius of our institutions being considered. The saying of this much would not be an attempt to re-enact the statute of Elizabeth. That statute authorized the Chancellor, etc., to issue commissions to the bishops, etc., to inquire with respect to the gifts recited in the act, to wit: \u201c Belief of aged and impotent, and poor people; maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers and mariners; schools of learning; free schools; scholars in universities; houses of correction; repair of bridges, ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks, and highways; education and preferment of orphans; marriages of poor maids; supportation and help of tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons decayed; relief or redemption of prisoners or captives; and aid or ease of any poor inhabitants concerning payment of fifteens, setting out of soldiers and other taxes\u201d\u2014and to ascertain whether the lands and effects appropriated to these purposes had been duly employed. The Commissioners were authorized to inquire as to abuses, breaches of trust, misemployments and misgovernments of any lands, etc., goods, etc., theretofore given, limited, appointed, etc. (or which thereafter might be), \u201cfor any of the charitable and godly uses before rehearsed,\u201d and after trial and examination to \u201c set down such orders, judgments, and decrees as the said lands, etc., might be duly and faithfully employed to and for such the charitable and godly uses and intents before rehearsed,\u201d etc. Sections 8 and 9 enact, that the\u201c orders, judgments, and decrees\u201d shall be certified under seal into the Court of Chancery within the time limited in the commission, and that the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, shall take such order for the due execution of all of such judgments, decrees, and orders \u201c as to him shall seem fit and convenient.\u201d\nIt is remarked, by Chief Justice Marshall, that the statute \u201cseems to proceed on the idea that the trusts it is intended to enforce, ought, in conscience, independent of the statute, to be carried into execution.\u201d (Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. 1.) If, then, the charity is one which could have been visited and regulated under the statute of Elizabeth, it is one which the English Court of Chancery would enforce on information or bill\u2014even assuming that the jurisdiction as to the subject-matter came from the statute.\nThe statute provides one method; the other method, universally resorted to when our State Constitution was adopted (supposing the power as to subject-matter was derived exclusively from the statute), was the invention of Chancery or at least grew out of the innate power of Chancery as a Court of Equity. It is hardly to be supposed that the framers of the State constitutions separated the mode from the power, or that they intended to exclude from the general grant of jurisdiction in \u201call Equity cases\u201d so large a class of Equity cases as those relating to the establishment and enforcement of charities. In Indiana it seems to have been held that a provision of the Constitution, which conferred upon the Courts of that State jurisdiction, \u201cboth as to matters of law and Equity,\u201d conferred power, in the nature of the prerogative power, over infants, legatees, charities, etc. (McCord v. Ochiltree, 8 Blackf. 19.) We are not here required to accede to so much; we are convinced that Courts of Equity in California are confined to powers in their nature judicial. But in determining what are the limits of the judicial powers to be exercised by our Courts of Equity, do we not naturally and properly look to such powers as were in fact exercised by the English Court of Chancery for generations before our Constitution was adopted? As is said by Mr. Perry, Courts of Equity in various of the States of the Union exercise a jurisdiction in Equity, without reference to the question whether the statute of Elizabeth \u201c has been technically adopted in their States.\u201d The impression is certainly produced by the reading of some of the decisions, that Courts have simply resorted to the principles announced in England in this class of cases, and have assumed the jurisdiction because it was exercised in the English Court of Chancery, without regard to the sources from whence the powers of that Court were derived.\nX. A trust in favor of \u201chuman beneficence and charity\u201d may be valid in view of the context.\nIt is urged that a trust in favor of \u201c human beneficence and charity\u201d is not a \u201ctrust for charitable uses,\u201d within the legal signification of that expression. .\nIn Norris v. Thomson's Ex\u2019rs, 19 N. J. Eq. 317, it was held that a power of appointment given in a will, \u201cto give or devise the same among such benevolent, religious, or charitable institutions as she may think proper,\u201d was void; that, as the power was to give to any of the three, and one of them was too vague, the trustee had the right to elect not to give to the other two. The Chancellor said: \u201cIt is conceded that by the English decisions, the words \u2018charitable and religious\u2019 are sufficiently definite;\u201d but added: \u201cThe word benevolent is certainly more indefinite, and of far wider range than charitable or religious; it would include all gifts prompted by good-will or kind feeling toward the recipient, whether an object of charity or not.\u201d The Chancellor further said: \u201cIn all the decisions on this subject, it has been held that a devise or bequest in England for benevolent objects, or in trust to give to such objects, is too indefinite, and therefore void, and not being within the scope of the statute of Elizabeth, is not saved by it.\u201d Here the word \u201ccharity\u201d was evidently held to have acquired a settled, technical meaning by reference to the objects enumerated in the preamble to the statute of Elizabeth\u2014a meaning less extended than that accorded to \u201cbenevolent.\u201d\nA distinction might perhaps be made between benevolent and beneficent. Doctor Webster remarks: \u201cEtymologically considered, benevolent implies merely wishing well to others, beneficent doing well. But by degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only feelings, but actions. Thus we speak of benevolent operations, benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. In like manner beneficent is now applied to feelings. Thus we speak of the beneficent intentions of a donor. The extension of the terms enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. Thus the phrase \u2018benevolent labors\u2019 turns attention to the source of these labors, viz., benevolent feeling, while beneficent would simply mark them as productive of good. So \u2018 beneficent intentions\u2019 point to the feelings of the donor as bent upon some speci\u00f1c good act, while \u2018 benevolent intentions\u2019 would only denote a general wish and design to do good.\u201d \u201c Beneficence,\u201d therefore, indicating a specific design, when followed by and connected with \u201ccharity,\u201d might be held to be limited by the succeeding word, and to import an intention to provide for acts in their nature charitable.\nIn Morice v. The Bishop of Durham, 9 Ves. Jr. 399, it was held by Sir William Grant, Master of the Bolls, that the signification of \u201c charity\u201d was derived chiefly from the statute of Elizabeth, and that those purposes were to be considered charitable which the statute enumerates, \u201c or which, by analogies, are deemed within its spirit and intendment.\u201d That \u201c a bequest in trust for such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his own discretion shall most approve,\u201d can not be supported as a \u201c charitable legacy.\u201d He said: \u201c It is clear, liberality and benevolence can find numberless objects not included in the statute in the largest construction of it. The use of the word \u2018charity\u2019 seems to have been purposely avoided in this will.\u201d On appeal, Lord Eldon sustained the view of the Master of the Rolls. In James v. Allen, 3 Meriv. 17, it was held that a bequest, in trust for \u201c benevolent\u201d purposes, could not be supported as a charitable legacy; the same learned Judge (Sir William Grant), deciding that the trust in Morice v. Bishop of Durham was not rendered uncertain, and therefore incapable of execution, merely by the addition of the word \u201c liberality\u201d to benevolent. Afterwards, in Kendall v. Granger, 5 Beav. 300, Lord Langdale, M. R., expressed himself not fully satisfied with all the decisions that had taken place on the subject, but held that a bequest \u201c to be applied for the relief of domestic distress, assisting indigent but deserving individuals, or encouraging undertakings of general utility,\u201d was void. And so, a still more modern case has decided, that a direction to executors to apply the residue of an estate to any charitable or benevolent purposes, they might agree upon, was indefinite and inoperative. (In re Jarmin\u2019s Estate, L. R, 8 Ch. D. 584.)\nWhere a bequest is made for charitable purposes and also for purposes of an indefinite character, which are not charitable, the whole bequest will be void. If, for instance, a bequest is made for such charitable, or other purposes, as the trustee should think fit, the whole bequest will be void for uncertainty.\u201d (Tudor on Charitable Trusts, 223.) It was said by counsel (arguendo) \u201c the principle of all the cases is, that the portion of the trust that might otherwise be construed as charitable, can not be sustained, because the trustees have an election to apply the fund to purposes not technically charitable.\u201d (Referring to Vezey v. Jamson, 1 Sim. & Stu. 69; Williams v. Kershaw, 5 Clark & F. 111; Ellis v. Selby, 1 Myl. & Cr. 286; Kendall v. Granger, 5 Beav. 300; Thompson v. Thompson, 1 Coll. 398.)\nThus it is settled in England, that the word \u201c benevolent\u201d in itself, without anything in its contextt to qualify or restrict its ordinary meaning, clearly includes not only purposes which are deemed charitable by Courts of Equity, but also acts which have no relation to the promotion of education, or any other of the objects which are deemed charitable in a technical or legal sense. So, it seems to have been held, that where the objects mentioned are separated by the disjunctive \u201c or,\u201d and it appears that it was the intention that the trustees might apply the whole fund to purposes not charitable, a gift must fail.\nIn Williams v. Kershaw, 5 Clark & F. 111, the gift was for such benevolent, religious, and charitable purposes as the trustees should, in their discretion, think most beneficial. The Master of the Rolls considered that these words were to be taken, not conjointly, but in a distributive sense. But in Mitford v. Reynolds, 1 Ph. 185, Lord Lyndhurst held, that even if the words \u201c charitable, beneficial, and public,\u201d were to be taken distributively and not conjunctively, yet when the words were followed by others, indicating that the money was to be applied to works for the general benefit of the inhabitants of a certain place, the previous words were limited by the latter, so that taking them together, a charity was created.\nAs said by Gray, J., in Chamberlain v. Stearns, 111 Mass. 268, the only difference in opinion in the adjudged cases, on this subject, has been the question how far the word \" benevolent,\u201d when used to describe the purposes of a trust, could be deemed to be limited in its meaning by being associated with other words more clearly pointing to a strictly charitable disposition of the fund. In the same case the learned Judge adds that it has been held by the House of Lords that \u201c benevolent\u201d with \u201c charitable\u201d or any equivalent word, or used in such connection, or applied to such institutions or corporations, as to manifest an intent to make it synonymous with \u201ccharitable,\u201d might have effect according to that intent. True, the cases cited by him in support of this statement (Chamberlain v. Stearns, 111 Mass. 268), are Scotch cases; and the Scotch law is less strict as to charitable dispositions than the English. (Lord Cottenham in Miller v. Rowan, 5 Cl. & F. 110; Lord Lyndhurst in Crichton v. Grierson, 3 Bligh\u2019s N. R. 438.) Nevertheless, the principle is indisputable, for it arises out of a rule of interpret ation, universally applicable, that the intention of the author of every written instrument is to be sought in the context.\nIn the will before us the testator, after \u201c devoting\u201d the income of the California Theater property perpetually to \u201c human beneficence and charity,\u201d adds, that while he does not wish to set \u201c arbitrary limits\u201d to the wisdom, faithfulness, and discretion of his trustees, yet desiring, as he does, \u201c to foster religion, learning, and charity,\u201d he calls their attention to \u201c the trials and afflictions of the industrious, striving, unfortunate poor,\" and to \u201c honorable and striving young men,\u201d for whom he wishes established a scholarship, to be known as \u201c The Hinckley Scholarship,\u201d etc.\nIt is admitted that \u201c learning\u201d is a charitable use. We shall endeavor to show that \u201c religion,\u201d in the broad sense in which the word is employed, is charitable.\nThus the intent of the testator is made more specific, and those things are benevolent or beneficent which advance religion and learning, and aid the poor. The conjunction between \u201c beneficence\u201d and \u201c charity\u201d may, in view of his intent as explained by what follows, be properly taken as uniting synonyms. Copulatio verborum indicat quod accipiantur in eodum, sensu. (Saltonstall v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 446.) The terms used ought not to be measured separately, but each is to be considered in its relation to the entire provision, and the general meaning of each is restricted by its associations, and made subordinate to the main purpose. (Rotch v. Emerson, 105 Mass. 431.) Applying the maxim noscitur a sociis, \u201c beneficent\u201d must be understood to refer to the charitable purposes which the testator intended to indicate in the clause as a whole.\nBut if the word beneficent is held to be the equivalent of benevolent, and a doubt remains whether the insertion of the latter in the will may not have destroyed the gift as a charity, it would seem that the language of section 1313 of the Civil Code must dispel the doubt. By that section charitable and benevolent corporations are placed upon the same footing; and it is to be supposed the \u201c trusts to charitable uses,\u201d mentioned immediately afterwards, include the same purposes as those for which the corporations named may be organized!\nAs to the word \u201c religion\u201d used in connection with \u201c learning and charity,\u201d if it can be given effect without violating any principle of existing law, it is our duty to give it such effect. (Whicker v. Hume, 14 Beav. 509; S. C., 1 De G. M. & G. 506; S. C., 7 H. L. Cases, 124; Saltonstall v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 455; Jackson v. Phillips, 14 id. 557.) In its primary sense (from religare, to rebind, to bind back), it imports, as applied to moral questions, only a recognition of a conscientious duty to recall and obey restraining principles of conduct. In such sense we suppose there is no atheist who will admit that he is without religion. But whatever, if any, the form of religion which the testator desired to foster, the context sufficiently indicates that it was to be fostered only by such acts of charity as of themselves are in full accord with the law of the land. Beyond this, the fact that all religions are tolerated in this country\u2014or rather, that all men are free to profess and practice any religion not violative of the legal rights of others\u2014does not invalidate every devise or bequest for the advancement even of a particular sect. Such bequests have been often upheld; as gifts to be appropriated to the benefit of the \u201c Friends\u2019 Meeting;\u201d for the assistance of \u201c Respectable Unitarian Congregations;\u201d for the \u201cUniversalist Denomination;\u201d for the \u201cMaintenance- of a Shaker Community.\u201d (Earle v. Wood, 8 Cush. 437; Dexter v. Gardner, 7 Allen, 245; Shrewsbury v. Hornby, 5 Hare, 406; North Adams Univer. Soc. v. Fitch, 8 Gray, 421; Gass v. Wilhite, 2 Dana, 170; S. C., 26 Am. Dec. 446.)\nXI. Cy pres, a judicial power.\nIt has further been contended by appellant that, at the most, the will is to be treated as dedicating the property to charity in general terms, and, so treating it, the trust can be satisfied by means of the cy pres power alone\u2014a power which Courts of Equity in this State can not exercise.\nWe have already pointed out the distinction between the cy pres as a prerogative and as a judicial power. We entertain no doubt that in the general devolution upon the Courts of this State of all judicial power, with respect to charities, is included the power cy pres, so far as the same may be employed in directing trustees named in a will or deed to carry into effect the general lawful and charitable intent, when the particular scheme is impracticable, or has become unlawful. In such, and other like cases, a resort can be had to the doctrine without departing from the strict limits of ordinary Chancery jurisdiction. \u201cWhere,\u201d said Lord Eldon, \u201cthe execution is to be by a trustee with general or some objects pointed out, then the Court will take the administration of the trust.\u201d (Moggredge v. Thackwell, 7 Ves. 86.) It was where the charities were illegal or indefinite, without trustees to determine the definite purposes, that they could only be carried into effect cy pres, by the sovereign power as an act of prerogative.\nXII. The Probate Court was not called on to employ the power cy pres.\nHere the classes to be benefited are clearly indicated. The purpose is apparent. The attention of the trustees is called to the industrious, striving, and unfortunate poor\u2014especially the aged, the infirm, and the lonely\u2014and to honorable, striving young men seeking moral and intellectual culture. Every written instrument must be read as a whole; a will is to be construed \u201cby the four corners.\u201d Words of request, or even the expression of a preference, are binding upon a devisee or executor in cases of private trusts. (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 1068; 1 Jarman on Wills, 334.) A fortiori in cases of charities, because the Courts look with favor upon all attempted charitable donations, and will endeavor to carry them into effect if it can be done consistently with the rules of law. A bequest intended as a charity is not void, and there is no authority to construe it to be legally void, if it can possibly be made good. (Sorresby v. Hollins, 9 Mod. 221; Grimmett v. Grimmett, Amb. 211; 1 Coll. Jurid. 439.)\nSurely the intent to aid in the support of the poor\u2014especially the aged, infirm, and lonely\u2014and to assist in the education of a class, permeates the language of the testator. If his purpose can be held to have been to devise property for such charitable uses as may aid and support the poor generally, and to educate some of a class of poor, he has himself nominated his trustees; he has vested in them the legal estate and they have accepted the trust. He has given them the widest discretion in selecting the particular persons to be benefited by his bounty, with full power to reduce the general intent to a specific and practical operation. It is immaterial how uncertain, indefinite, and vague are the cestuis que trustent, or final beneficiaries, provided a general lawful and charitable intent is apparent, and there is a legal mode of rendering the beneficiaries certain by means of trustees. (Perry on Trusts, 732.)\nXII. One third of a testator\u2019s \u201c distributable assets\u201d may be devised or bequeathed to charitable uses.\nAnother question remains to be answered: Do the words \u201c one third of the estate\u201d as used in section 1313 of the Civil Code, hereinbefore recited, mean one third of the gross estate of the testator, or one third of the \u201c distributable assets\u201d\u2014 being one third of the residue of the estate after payment of the debts, etc. ? The Court below held that the statute authorized a gift to charities to the extent of one third of the appraised value of all the property.\nAs we have already said, the section of the code is of the same class of legislation as are mortmain acts\u2014so called. The general purpose is to prevent extravagant donations, in those hours of physical and mental lassitude which often precede dissolution\u2014\u201c to the disherison of natural heirs.\u201d Here the niece of testator is the residuary devisee and legatee, and the purpose of the testator that she should have whatever he had not otherwise legally disposed of is sufficiently apparent. Her position is analogous to that of a sole heir where the residuum is not specially bequeathed.\nThe main purpose of section 1313 being to protect heirs, or those in like position, against excessive gifts to charities, it ought not to be construed so as to deprive the heirs of all benefit from the estate, unless the language unmistakably requires it. Yet that such might be the result of imposing the whole burden of the debts upon the interest of the heirs is indisputable. The word estate is indeed nomen generalissimum. Originally perhaps it was used to designate the interest which one had in land; then to indicate the land itself\u2014technically the corpus; it was afterwards extended to all property real and personal. (Burr. L. D., \u201c Estate.\u201d) In wills the import of the term depends in a great degree upon its association with other expressions. (Id. 2 Pow. on Dev.\u2014 by Jarman\u2014158, c. 10.) The same is true, of course, when the word is used in statutes.\nAs said by Mr. Abbott: \u201cEstate is used in several very variant senses. Only the context, or the circumstances under which it is employed, can guide one in assigning to it the meaning intended.\u201d (Burr. L. D., \u201c Estate.\u201d) The same writer-adds: \u201cIn a very common use, estate signifies the entire condition in respect to property of an individual; as in speaking of a bankrupt, decedent, or insolvent estate, or of administering upon an estate. Here not only property but indebtedness is part of the idea. The estate does not consist of the assets only; if it did, such expressions as insolvent estates would be misnomers.\u201d (Burr. L. D., \u201c Estate.\u201d) Doubtless the \u201ccircumstance,\u201d already twice referred to, that the main purpose of section 1313 is to prevent improvident dispositions to charities, to the injury of those who would otherwise receive the donations, is to be seriously considered in determining the specific meaning of a term which has been employed in so many \u201c very variant senses.\u201d It is indeed true that the word \u201c estate\u201d is used at times in the Code of Civil Procedure as signifying all of the decedent\u2019s property. (\u00a7\u00a7 1645, 1648.) Elsewhere too in the same code we find the expressions \u201c the residue of the estate,\u201d \u201cthe residue of any estate.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. 1665, 1668.) But too much stress ought not to be placed upon these applications of a term, which in the codes themselves is employed in different senses. Thus: \u201cThe executor is to deliver to the heir, legatee, or devisee, the whole portion of the estate to which he may be entitled,\u201d i. e., a portion of the distributable assets. (Code Civ. Proc. 1661.) \u201cBefore any distribution of an estate is made,\u201d etc. (Id. 1669.) \u201cWhen any estate is assigned.\u201d (1691.) \u201cThe Court must direct * * * the distribution of an estate.\u201d (1651.) \u201c An order for the distribution of the estate.\u201d (1650.) \u201c In the decree assigning and distributing the estate.\u201d (1686.) In the sections last cited the word estate is clearly used as the equivalent of \u201cdistributable assets.\u201d The generalization of counsel for appellant would seem to be correct: Where the Code of Civil Procedure speaks of claims of creditors, settle ment of the estate, sales of property, and partnership interests, it refers to the whole estate of the decedent; but where it speaks of the distribution of an estate, and of persons entitled to such distribution, and their proportionate interests, it refers to the disposable assets only. When it speaks of an insolvent estate, the word includes, in idea, the indebtedness as well as the property.\nIn deciding in what sense the term is used in section 1313 of the Civil Code, therefore, the very slightest, if any, weight should be given to the fact that it sometimes signifies the estate in gross. The first section of the first chapter of the title Civil Code (\u00a7 1270) which treats of wills\u2014the chapter which includes section 1313\u2014reads as follows: \u201c Every person over the age of eighteen years, of sound mind, may, by last will, dispose of all his estate, real and personal, and such estate not disposed of by will is succeeded to as provided in title vii of this part, being chargeable in both cases with the payment of all the decedents debts, as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d True, a specific bequest is payable first out of the residuum, but in such case the residuum is previously ascertained by providing for the debts. A devise or bequest of an aliquot part of an estate would give right only to the portion of the residuary estate. \u201c Suppose a testator declares in his will, \u2018 I give one third of my estate to my son A.,\u2019 can there be any doubt that the word estate would be held to mean distributable assets ?\u201d\nOur conclusion is that section 1313 of the Civil Code prohibits devises or bequests to charitable uses, of more than one third of that which a testator has power to give, that is, of the property which shall remain after payment of his debts and charges of administration. As of what date or dates is to be ascertained the value of the disposable property\u2014one third of which may go to charity?\nThe valuation of the \u201c inventory\u201d is evidently not intended to be conclusive for any purpose. The appraisers make a preliminary estimate for the information of the Court; and as property not included in the original inventory is discovered, it is made the duty of the executor or administrator to cause the value of such property also to be estimated by the appraisers. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1445, 1451.)\nYet it must be assumed that section 1313 of the Civil Code was enacted in view of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure which establish the mode of conducting probate cases, since such provisions and those of the Civil Code relating to wills constitute together the statutory scheme for the settlement of the estates of deceased persons. As we have seen, the testator had the right to donate to charitable uses one third of that which he had power to devise and bequeath. The whole residuum became fixed, under the Code of Civil Procedure, only when the allowed claims against the estate and costs of administration were determined, and the residuum therefore ready for distribution; that is to say, the total value of the distributable estate\u2014the estate one third of which may be devoted to charity\u2014is ascertainable by aggregating the values of all the assets, real and personal, distributed, as of the date or dates of distribution. If the Probate Court has not the machinery for ascertaining these values, m may still declare, in its decree of distribution, the right of the residuary devisee to an undivided interest in the theater property equal to the excess, if any such there be, beyond an interest in the trustees equal to one third of all the estate distributed. E. G.\u2014If the value of all the property distributed was ninety thousand dollars, the trustees will be entitled to retain thirty thousand dollars, in the theater property ; that is to say, an undivided interest equivalent to a fraction of which thirty thousand is the numerator and a number equal to the number of dollars which represent the value of the theater property, when distributed, is the denominator. This, because the testator had power to dedicate to charity, not merely one third of the theater property, but one third of all the property of which he had the power of disposition.\nAfter the fifteen specific legacies are paid, the trustees will be entitled to retain, subject to the charitable uses, the legal title to an undivided interest in the theater property equal to one third of what remained of all the property after deducting debts and expenses\u2014one third of what was distributed. If one third of the value of the estate distributed shall be less than the value of the theater property\u2014its value as of the date of the decree of distribution being ascertained\u2014the trustees will hold the remainder in trust for appellant.\nThe precise pecuniary value of the interests of the trustees and appellant can not now be determined here: First, the costs of administration are not shown by the transcript; second, the transcript does not clearly show but claims have been allowed other than the thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollar mortgage, the only claim which distinctly appears to have been allowed; third, the transcript does not show the value of the distributable assets when distributed.\nIf the theater property shall be \u201c capitalized\u201d as provided in the will, the rights of the trustees and residuary legatee in the fund will be proportionately the same as their rights in the property.\nXIV. Modification of decree in the Court below.\nThe decree must be reversed, with direction to the Superior Court to modify it so as to accord with the views herein last above expressed.\nThe decree must be limited to defining the rights of the respective parties in the trust estate. As was said by the learned Judge of the Probate Court: \u201c It is, under our system, the necessary province of a Probate Court to inquire and determine whether a valid trust has been created. The mode of administering, the power to regulate and direct its subsequent administration, is quite separate and distinct from a question of whether a legal trust has been expressed. * * * Section 1665, Code Civ. Proc., provides that \u2018the Court must proceed to distribute the residue of the estate among the persons who by law are entitled thereto.\u2019 \u201d With this view of the learned Judge, we are in full accord. We may add that it is within the province of the Probate Court to define the rights of all who have legally or equitably any interest in the property of the estate, derived from the will, whether they are entitled to any present enjoyment, or their interests are contingent. If, when the specific legacies shall be paid, the appellant here shall be entitled to a conveyance of any portion of the theater property under the principles announced in the probate decree, and a conveyance shall be denied by the trustees, a Court of Equity will be amply competent to enforce it.\nJudgment reversed, and cause remanded with direction to\u00bb the Court below to modify the decree so as to accord with the views herein expressed.\nRoss, J., Morrison, C. J., McKee, J., Sharpstein, J., and Thornton, J., concurred."},{"case_name":"William Dodge, Conservator, v. Almiron S. Cole et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/2844024\/","date":"1881-02-03","court":"Illinois Supreme Court","content":"Mr. Justice Mulkev\ndelivered the opinion of the Court:\n\u2022 This is a proceeding in chancery, commenced by appellant, against appellees, in the Peoria county circuit court, on the 20th of April, 1874, as conservator of Maria Sharp, a lunatic, which seeks to have set aside and declared fraudulent and void, divers deeds and conveyances relating to a valuable parcel of land, now constituting a part of the city of Peoria, in this State, which, it is claimed, belongs to the ward of appellant.\n\u25a0 There was a hearing upon the merits, in the court below, resulting in a decree dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill, and the case is brought to this court by appeal.\n\u25a0 The facts which we regard as material to a determination of the case, and which we consider substantially established by the evidence, are as follows:\nIn . the year 1827, George Sharp purchased a squatter\u2019s claim on the fractional N. E. qr. of Sec. 17, T. 8, FT. P. 8, E. 4th P. M., and settled upon it with his family, with a view of pre-empting it. Without having done so, some four 3-ears afterwards he died, leaving his wife and children in possession of it as a residence. Elizabeth Sharp, his widow, together with her famity, continued to reside upon the premises till the 15th of December, 1834, when she died, leaving five children:. Sarah Jane, aged 22 years; Jackson, ten; Washington, eight; Cynthia Ann, six; and Maria, four. The latter was then, and has ever since remained, a confirmed and helpless imbecile. On the 4th of May following, Lewis Bigelow was appointed administrator of her estate, in which capacity he acted till the time of his death, about two years afterwards. On November 10, 1834, Sarah Jane intermarried with John H. Lisk, and she and her husband, either in person or by tenants, continued to occupy the premises until after they were partitioned and sold, as hereinafter stated.\nSubsequent to her mother\u2019s death, and previous to her intermarriage with Lisk, Sarah Jane obtained from government a pre-emption right to the fractional quarter section above mentioned, and after her marriage, to-wit: on the 6th of June, 1836, in pursuance of an arrangement between herself and the administrator, the latter purchased it from the United States in her name, and paid for it out of moneys then in his hands as administrator of her mother\u2019s estate. The amount paid for the land was $189.46$, being $1.25 per acre. The register and receiver of the Land Office, respectively, issued to her at the time, by the name of Sarah S. Sharp, the usual certificates of payment and entry.\nAlthough the entry was made in her name, it was understood and intended, at the time, for the benefit of the other four children, equally with herself, and, with a view of protecting their interests, she, at the time of the entry or immediately thereafter, entered into a written stipulation to equally partition the land between them and herself. In pursuance of this agreement, at the July special term, 1839, of the Peoria circuit court, the land in question was, by the decree of the court, upon the petition of herself and husband, equally divided between her and the other four children. The partition proceedings appear regular, except that it does not affirmatively appear there was service on Jackson. All parties seemed to be satisfied with the division of the land, so far as the record shows, and the validity of the proceedings does not appear to have ever been questioned till the com mencement of the present suit. The petition shows, upon its face, the circumstances under which the entry of the land was made by the administrator, so that the equities of the other children were made to fully appear in that proceeding. After these partition proceedings, to-wit: on the 10th of July, 1844, a patent was issued to Mrs. Lisk, by the name of Sarah S. Sharp, the name in which the entry was made. On the 29th of April, 1847, JohnH. Lisk and his family, including the said Maria, were then residents of DeWitt county, this State, and on that day the said Maria, upon Disk\u2019s petition, without service on her, was adjudged, by the circuit court of that county, an insane person, and he, at the same time, was appointed her conservator. Previous to his appointment as conservator, to-wit: on the 14th of March, 1837, he had been appointed, by the probate court of Peoria county, her guardian, and was still acting in that capacity.\nOn the 27th of May, 1847, Lisk, in his capacity of conservator, presented an ex parte petition to the circuit court of Peoria county, being still a resident of DeWitt county\u2014setting forth that his ward was the owner of certain real estate in Peoria county,\u2014being in part the same allotted to her in the partition proceeding,\u2014that it was unproductive, and ask-ins; a decree to sell the same for her maintenance. On the 4th of June a decree was rendered in accordance with the prayer of the petitioner; and, in pursuance thereof, on the 14th of August following, the premises were sold by Lisk at public sale, and, by an arrangement between him and one Hamlin, they were bid oif by the latter at the sum of $700, which Avas about their value at that time. Hamilton paid nothing for the premises, and on the same day, without consideration, reconveyed them to Lisk. A report of this sale was approved by the court on the 21st of October, following.\nThe sale of Maria\u2019s land by order of the court, as just stated, included her interest in Jackson\u2019s part of the land, he having previously died, in 1843, intestate, Avithout any children, or descendants of children, or wife.\nOn the 28th of April, 1848, Disk, as conservator, made a report to the circuit court of DeWitt county, showing the sale of his ward\u2019s lands in Peoria county and the receipt by him of the $700 realized from the sale, and also that his ward was indebted to him for support, payment of taxes, etc., in the sum of $1400, or thereabouts, and asking that the proceeds of the land be applied to the payment of his claim, and it was so ordered by the court.\nAt the December .term, 1872, of the DeWitt circuit court, Disk made a final report, showing that all moneys and effects belonging to his ward were exhausted, and at his own request, was, by order of the court, discharged from the office and trust of conservator.\nAt the following August term of the same court, upon the petition of George W. Funk, a relative of the said Maria, William M. Dodge, the appellant, was appointed her conservator instead of Lisle, and the present suit is brought by him as such conservator. Appellees respectively claim title to separate and distinct parcels of the lot of ground assigned to Maria under the partition proceeding, and also that which she inherited from her brother Jackson, through conveyances made by Lisk and his wife more than twenty years before the commencement of this suit.\nIn addition to the proceeds of this land, Lisk, as conservator, received, on account of his ward, $105, her distributive share of her mother\u2019s, estate. Maria, from the time of their intermarriage, in 1834, up to the present time, has been supported and cared for exclusively by Lisk and his wife, covering a period of some forty years or more, at the time of the commencement of this suit, during all which time she has not had mind sufficient to feed herself without assistance, and the only compensation they have ever received therefor, so far as the record shows, is the proceeds of this land and the $105 above mentioned.\n. Under these circumstances, nothing but an imperative sense of duty would incline us to disturb the titles of-valuable estates, based upon legal proceedings which occurred so many years ago, and which' the proofs abundantly show were conducted in the best of faith.\nThe theory of appellant is, that the appointment of Disk as conservator, and the sale, by him, of his ward\u2019s land, was absolutely null and void, and that, by reason of her idiocy, the statutes of limitation have not run against her, and that her title, being a matter of record appearing upon the face of the partition proceedings to which Disk and his wife were parties, all persons claiming by or through them, either immediately or remotely, are chargeable with notice of her rights, and must be regarded, according to a well recognized principle in equity, as holding the property in trust for her. If the assumption of appellant is justified by the facts, we see no means of escaping the conclusion reached.\nIn the view we take of the case, it will be necessary to. Consider but few of the numerous questions which have been so elaborately discussed by counsel.\nWhatever is in. the case on either side, it is believed, has been, through the industry, research and legal ability of counsel, developed and presented in its most favorable light, to their respective clients, thus furnishing us, without labor On our part, with all the available material that can possibly be obtained to aid us in reaching a conclusion with respect to the mutual rights of the parties before us.\nIt is clear, from the proofs in this case, that Maria Sharp, from a period anterior to the purchase of the land in controversy from the government, to the time of commencing this suit, has been a confirmed lunatic, and can not therefore be held\" accountable for any apparent negligence, laches or delay in seeking redress through the courts, or otherwise, for any wrong or injustice that may have been done her with respect to the property in question. Nor is she at all affected by any of the various statutes of limitations that now, or have heretofore existed in this State, which, but for her lunacy, would have barred the present proceeding; and this we understand to be, in effect, admitted by appellees. The validity, therefore, of the partition proceedings, the appointment of Disk as conservator, the sale of the land by him, under the decree of the Peoria circuit court, and of all other matters of a like character, must be regarded, so far as she is concerned, as unaffected by lapse of time, or the Statute of Dimitations.\nIt is claimed by appellees, that by reason of Maria Sharp being a lunatic, it was not within the power of the administrator to convert the money which belonged to her, as distributee of her mother\u2019s estate, into land; and that its appropriation by him for that purpose simply gave her a lien upon the land for the money thus appropriated; that as the law forbids such conversion, whatever interest she acquired in the land must be regarded as personal estate, and a number of authorities are cited in support of the position. If she were dead, and this was a controversy between her heirs and personal representatives as to which should take her interest in the land, quite a different question would be presented. But we are of opinion the principle contended for and announced in the cases cited have no application to the circumstances of this case. If her money Avas invested in land, though improperly, the conversion nevertheless became effectual and irrevocable as to all persons, or except those having some legal interest in the money comrerted. Neither the appellees nor any one else are seeking in this proceeding to recover the money thus invested or to reach any portion of her personal estate.\nWe are, therefore, clearly of opinion, that whatever might be the rule under different circumstances, the principle contended for has no application to the facts of this case.\nThe real and vital point in this case seems to turn upon the validity of the sale by the conservator, of Maria\u2019s interest in the land, under the decree of the Peoria circuit court. For, Avhatever might be the v\u00edbavs of the court upon all other questions involved in the controversy, if this one should be determined against appellant, it would be fatal to the present proceeding. On the other hand, if the Peoria circuit court had no jurisdiction or authority to order the sale, and the whole proceeding, including the sale, was a mere nullity, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that appellant is entitled to recover. We shall, therefore, proceed at once to the consideration of that question.\nIt is claimed, in the first place, that the proceedings in the DeWitt circuit court, in which Maria Sharp was adjudged an insane person and John H. Lisle was appointed her conservator, are null and void, for the reason it does not appear that there was personal service on her, and that therefore Lisle had no right or authority, as conservator, to malee application for a sale of the land, or to sell the same under the directions of the court; that his appointment being void, his action in the premises must be regarded as that of a mere stranger, and in support of this position Eddy v. The People ex rel. etc. 15 Ill. 386, is cited and relied on. It is sufficient to say, with respect to this question, that we are of opinion that the validity of Lisk\u2019s appointment as conservator can not be inquired into in a collateral proceeding like the present. It is the settled doctrine of this court,that the regularity or validity of an administrator\u2019s appointment can not be questioned collaterally, (Wight v. Wallbaum, 39 Ill. 563, Duffin v. Abbott, 48 id. 18,) and on principle we can see no difference in the ease of a conservator and an administrator. The appointment was made more than forty years ago, and from thence until a short time before the bringing of this suit, Lisk was faithfully discharging the duties of the trust without his authority to act being questioned by any one, and now for the first time, in a mere collateral proceeding, it is sought to go into an inquiry as to the regularity and propriety of his appointment.\nIt is further claimed, that at the time of the rendition of the decree by the circuit court of Peoria county authorizing a sale of the land, there was no law in existence in this State conferring upon circuit courts power to order a sale of the land of an idiot or insane person. If this position be true, it necessarily follows the whole' proceedings in that court, and the sale under it by the conservator, were a nullity, and all persons claiming title through such proceedings and sale are chargeable with notice of that fact, for every one is conclusively presumed to know, when purchasing an estate, the legal effect of every judgment or decree through which he deraigns title.\nIt is conceded that at the time of these proceedings there was no statute which, in terms, authorized courts of chancery to entertain applications for the sale of real estate belonging to an idiot or insane person. The statute then in force gave the conservator \u201cthe entire care of the estate,\u201d \u201cboth real and personal,\u201d of an \u201c idiot, lunatic or distracted person,\u201d and authorized him to sue and be sued in his capacity of conservator, and also provided that executions issued against him as conservator might be levied upon any property in his-possession, whether real or personal, belonging to his ward, not exempt from execution, and that the same might be sold as in other cases. It also authorized him to sell and dispose of the personal estate of his ward without any order of the court for that purpose, but no such power was conferred upon him with respect to the real estate. The act also provided that the conservator should be allowed reasonable compensation for his services, yet it was silent as to how he was to be paid where the estate of his ward consisted solely, as in this case, of unproductive real estate. \u00a1Revised Laws of 1833, p. 332.\nThe statute in force at that time in relation to the poor of' the county, like our present statute, made no provision for any one who had property of his own. So, if the position of appellant is correct, it follows that an idiot or insane person' at that time, if his conservator were unable to obtain credit, might, with an unproductive estate in lands worth $100,000' or more, have starved to death, while neither the State nor his relations would have been under any obligations to provide for him, simply because there was no power in the courts to order a sale of his lands. If such was the law at the time of those proceedings, it must be confessed it was extremely- defective, and it is difficult to conceive how a court, whose jurisdiction is founded mainly upon necessity and the general principle that it will afford relief where there is no adequate remedy at law, would be impotent to afford relief under such circumstances. We can not yield our assent to this view of the matter.\nThe legislature, in providing the conservator should have reasonable compensation for'his services, must have intended the appropriate courts should be open to him where it could not be otherwise enforced. Other creditors, where there was no personal estate, were authorized, under the provisions of the statute, to go into a court of law, obtain judgments against the conservator, sue out executions, and cause the real estate of the ward in the conservator\u2019s possession to be sold in satisfaction of their judgments. But the statute afforded him no such remedy. He could not, of course, sue himself, as conservator, nor could he sue his ward in a court of law; so, in such case, all creditors would have a remedy except the conservator, unless he were permitted to go into a court of equity for relief, and the only relief that court could afford would be to order a sale of so much of the land as would be necessary to pay his demand.\nThe law, upon the appointment of the conservator, confers upon him certain powers, and imposes certain duties, which the statute, in express terms, denominates a trust. The relation of trustee and cestui que trust is at once created between him and his ward. The estate of the latter becomes a trust fund for his own support and that of his family, if he has one, and, like any other trust fund, it is subject to the control and direction of a court of equity.\nThe argument by which the conclusion is reached, that a court of chancery had no power to order the sale in question, is, in general terms, as we understand it, substantially this: That by the common law of England, as it existed prior to the fourth year of the reign of James the .First, the power and control over the perso'ns and property of lunatics and idiots belonged to the king, as parens patriae,- and were exercised by him through the Lord. Chancellor. That although this jurisdiction was exercised by the Lord Chancellor in the High Court of Chancery, yet it was not exercised by him in his character of Chancellor, .or by virtue of the general powers pertaining to that court, but, on the contrary, by virtue of a separate and distinct commission under the sign manual from the crown. That upon the organization of our State government the State, as a political sovereignty, in its character of parens patriae, succeeded to all the rights and duties previously enjoyed or exercised by the Crown of England with respect to idiots and lunatics and their estates. That the power to which the State thus succeeded is not of a judicial character, wherefore, in the distribution of the powers of government under the constitution, it was not thereby delegated to or conferred upon the judicial department of government, and hence, without express legislation, a court of chancery was not authorized to exercise it. That this view has much force in it can not be denied.\nIt is conceded that the power exercised by the Lord Chancellor of England, over the, persons and estates of lunatics and idiots, was, in early times, when the jurisdiction of the High Court of Chancery was very limited, conferred upon him by special grant from the crown, and was not, except, perhaps, to a limited extent, referable to the general powers exercised by him in his character of Chancellor. We also understand, that in theory of law, the State, in its character of parens patriae, may rightfully exercise the same power and control over the persons and property of lunatics and idiots, that was exercised by the Crown of England through the Lord Chancellor, at the period referred to. We further understand, that under the constitution of 1818, and the statutes in force at the time of the sale in question, the circuit courts of this State possessed original jurisdiction in all matters * * * in chancery, as the same had been previously exercised and understood in the courts of this country and England, having general chancery powers, and that they possessed no other or further powers or jurisdiction.\nAnd it must also be confessed, that the decided weight of authority establishes the proposition, that a court of chancery has no inherent poAver to decree a sale of lands belonging to lunatics, idiots, infants, or others laboring under disabilities.\nLea\\ring out of v\u00edbav the effect of the statute relating to idiots and insane persons, already allude.d to, it folloAvs that if the sale in question can be sustained at all, it must be upon general and fundamental principles which have not heretofore received full recognition by courts of equity in determining their power to order such sales, and this will lead us to consider, briefly, the general features of our State government, so far as they may be supposed to have any bearing upon this question.\nAll political powers which the State may rightfully exercise at all, belong, ultimately, to the people, in their sovereign corporate capacity, Avhich they may distribute for purposes of government, in such manner as they think best, subject to the limitation, that when the State government is organized it shall be republican in form. These powers of government are, in their very nature, either legislative or executive. Every legitimate exercise of political poAver, of necessity, consists in the making or execution of some Iuav.\nThe executive powers are, in their nature, either judicial or ministerial; hence, for convenience of administration, the pOAvers of government are, by the constitution of this State, and that of all the others, so far as Ave are advised, divided into three classes, namely: legislative, executive and judicial; and, by this division, are conferred respectiA'ely upon three distinct branches of the government, and this being a complete disposition of the Avhole, it folloAvs, neither branch of government to whom these powers haAre been thus delegated, can exercise any of those conferred upon either of the others. While each department is, in theory, independent of the others, and must, therefore, in the first instance, judge of its own powers within. the grant, yet, whenever any property right is drawn in question, in a legal proceeding depending upon an alleged usurpation of power by either of the other departments, and not Avith respect to a matter of which such department is made the exclusive judge, the ultimate power of determining the question belongs to the judiciary. It is the right of the legislature to pass general laws for the government and regulation of all persons and property within the State, and it is made the exclusive judge\u201eof their fitness and propriety, so long as they do not encroach upon the powers entrusted to' the other departments of the government, or interfere Avith vested rights.\nThe legislature has the power, should it deem it expedient, to repeal all laws not' embodied in the constitution, except such as are essential to the enforcement of vested rights, and, subject to the same limitation, it may change the forms of action and modes of procedure in courts of justice to Avhatever extent it may see fit.\nThe judicial powers of the State are exercised by courts established under the constitution, in conformity Avith the usage and principles of the common law, or in the manner prescribed by the legislature.\nWhen set in motion by the institution of suits for the settlement of difficulties, it is the province of courts to declare what the law is, and apply it to the controversies before them. They have no poAArer to make law. That is a legislative function, which must be exercised exclusively by the legislative branch of the government. They are only permitted to declare AA'hat the laAV is, and apply it to existing controversies, when brought before them by some appropriate proceeding.\nThese general propositions are plain, simple and well understood by all who haAre even a limited knowledge of the organic law of the State.\nNevertheless, when we come to apply \"them to actual controversies, growing out of the varied relations which the citizens sustain to the State and to one another, we encounter doubts and difficulties of the gravest character.\nJust where the dividing line is to be drawn between judicial and legislative power, with respect to certain subjects, often presents questions about which enlightened courts and eminent jurists widely differ.\nSo, while the powers of courts seem so very simple and clearly defined, yet, in the application of them to actual cases, their proper limits are often difficult to determine. And the difficulty in this respect is not a little enhanced by the fact, the same constitution by which the distribution of the powers of government is made, provides for a specific class of courts by name, which have, from time immemorial, had a definite mode of procedure, and exercised many powers which, if determined by the constitutional test, as founded on the simple distribution of the powers of government, could hardly be regarded as strictly judicial, and it is reasonable to suppose that the people, in providing, through the organic law of the State, for these courts, intended to establish them with all the powers which had theretofore been exercised bv those courts. As an illustration, where the legislature has not otherwise provided, all courts of record and of general jurisdiction, may prescribe such reasonable rules as may be necessary for the efficient transaction of their business, and parties litigant and counsel are bound by them. Nevertheless, the power thus exercised in the adopting of such rules, is clearly, in its nature, legislative, and not judicial. Moreover, much that is done by the judges who preside over these courts is purely of a ministerial character, yet absolutely essential to the transaction of the business of the courts. So, much of their procedure and many of their powers are of common law origin. On this principle, courts, without any legislation for that purpose, are understood to have an inherent power to cause to be brought before them and pun ishsd all persons who unlawfully obstruct their process during term time.\nThe very act of establishing a court, by implication confers upon it such powers, not expressly given, as are necessary to the efficient transaction of all such business as it is by law authorized to perform.\nThe primary object of every enlightened government is the protection of the persons and property of its citizens; and of all the agencies usually provided for the accomplishment of this object, the courts are confessedly the most efficient.\nThe State, upon its organization, assumes the duty of providing for the peace, health, security and common welfare of all who owe it allegiance, and it especially undertakes to provide for and protect those who are, in fact or in contemplation of law, unable to take care of themselves; and this is accomplished, to a large degree, through its courts. Through their coercive powers property is protected from the assaults of force, fraud and dishonesty, and through their administration is made to supply the wants and relieve the necessities of the weak and helpless, and to accomplish these ends is the primary object in establishing them. Courts of chancery deal with property rights almost exclusively.\nIndeed, it has been said by high authority, that they are powerless to act in any case where the rights of property are not in some manner involved, though this is denied by others. However this may be, it is undeniable that the business of courts of equity is almost, if not entirely, confined to adjusting difficulties and controversies with respect to property, and to administering it for the benefit of those who are not permitted by the law, or have not mind sufficient, to act for themselves.\nIn short, courts of equity liave to deal with, declare and enforce property rights. They have no power to create them. Their business is simply to declare and enforce them as they find them, through the modes of procedure which the law has provided. Every right to be thus declared and enforced by a court of equity springs from the law by reason of the existence of some fact or facts, or combination of facts. Therefore, in every suit of the kind, it is the duty of the court, where it is denied, to ascertain, in the first place, whether the fact or combination of facts upon which the right depends, exists; and in the second place, to determine whether the law, as applicable to the facts found, gives the right claimed; and the performance of these duties, on the part of the court, is the exercise of judicial power.\nHow, inasmuch as the primary object of all property rights is to provide the owner with means to relieve his wants and necessities, and to administer to his comfort, convenience and well-being, the law wisely gives to every adult person, not laboring under disabilities, the unlimited right to dispose of whatever belongs to him in such manner and for such purposes as he may deem most conducive to the object in question, and there is no difference, in this respect, between personal and real estate. And, inasmuch as infants are presumed by law to be incapable of contracting, and therefore are not permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of their estates, except to a limited extent, courts of equity have, from time immemorial, upon proper application, assumed jurisdiction over their persons, their personal estate, and the rents and profits of their lands, and applied the same to their support and education, and this without any special statute authorizing them to do so. And in the same manner the Lord Chancellor in England, as we have already seen, by virtue of a special commission from the Crown, applied the personal estate and the profits of the real estate of lunatics'and idiots to their support and maintenance. Upon what principle may it be said, then, that a court of equity has an inherent right to order a sale of the personal estate of an infant for his support, and yet have no such inherent power to dispose of his lands for the same purpose? It is not a sufficient answer to say, because one is personal property and the other is real-property. The right to own property at all, as we have just seen, implies the right to have it applied to one\u2019s support, and there is no difference in this respect between land and personal estate, or whether the owner is an infant or an idiot, or an adult free from disabilities.\nInasmuch as the jurisdiction of courts of equity, in disposing of the personal estate of infants for their support, does not depend upon any statutory provisions, but upon, general principles, it is important to ascertain as definitely as we can the true reasons upon which the jurisdiction rests, and also to discover, if possible, the grounds upon which they have hitherto declined to assume jurisdiction, when the application has been to sell realty for the same purpose.\nSo far as this country is concerned, the mere difference between the two kinds of property can not reasonably be regarded as an element in the question. It is believed the' true and only rational grounds upon which the jurisdiction rests, are: 1. The duty of the State to protect and provide for such of its citizens as are incapable of taking care of themselves. 2. The right of every owner of property to have it applied to his support. 3. The absolute necessity for such relief. 4. Such applications involve the exercise of judicial power. 5. The duty which the State owes to those laboring under disabilities can be more appropriately and efficiently performed through courts of equity than in any other way.\nSince all of these reasons apply with equal force to applications for the sale of real property, the natural inquiry arises, why is it held the jurisdiction does not extend to real property? Doubtless, for two reasons:\n1. The jurisdiction originated in England, at a time when it was contrary to the settled policy of that country to interrupt the course of descents to real property. The law of primogeniture was then in full vigor, and was regarded with great favor by the courts, and of course every severance of an estate necessarily interrupted the course of descent, and was justly regarded as antagonistic to the much cherished right of primogeniture. It was the pride of the English people to keep their large and valuable landed estates intact, so that they might descend from generation to generation in the same family. Moreover, the lands- there tvere almost universally productive, so that the income, as a general rule, was all that was necessary for the support of those laboring under disabilities, hence there was no necessity for the sale of the realty. The policy of this country is the very reverse of that which gave rise to the rule in England. With us it has been the settled policy to keep our lands unfettered by entailments, and to encourage, as far as possible, their free and untrammeled transfer from one to another.\n2. The recognition, in this country, of the rule Avhich permits courts of chancery to order a sale of the personal estate, but not of the realty, of persons laboring under disabilities, is attributable solely to the great veneration in which previous decisions are held by the courts. As a general rule, a court follows the old beaten track of precedents, without ever stopping to inquire into the reasons upon which they rest, until it discovers that to follow it in some particular case Avill rer suit in great hardship or manifest injustice, when, for the first time, it feels itself bound to reconsider the reasons upon which the precedents it has hitherto followed rest, and upon such reconsideration it may find that the grounds upon Avhich the original case Avas decided are not sound, and that all the subsequent cases have simply folloAved it without examining the reasons upon which it rests, or it may turn out that the reasons upon Avhich the original case was decided have ceased to exist. In either of the cases supposed, where the case has not become a rule of property, the court should disregard the precedents, and announce such a rule as is consonant with reason and justice.\nThe value of every case as a precedent, AA'hich is not founded upon some statutory provision and has not become a rule of property, depends entirely upon the reasons Avhich support it. If it is founded upon a misapprehension of facts, or is supported by false logic, or the reasons upon Avhich it rests have ceased to exist, and the case has not become a rule of property, it should be disapproved, and no longer be recognized as authoritative.\nOn the other hand, where a question has once been solemnly decided by a respectable court of last resort, the decision of such court should, unless some of the reasons we have mentioned, or others equally good, affirmatively appear to- the contrary, be accepted as the best evidence as to what the law is on that question, and courts should give it effect accordingly, or, in other words, should adhere to the principle of stare deeisis.\nThe general rule unquestionably is, all cases falling within the same principle, however much they may differ in their facts as to unimportant matters, should be decided in the same way. In our judgment, in this country, where it is the settled policy, as we have seen, .to encourage the free transfer of real property to the same extent as that of personal estate, there is no more reason for holding that a court of equity has an inherent power to order the sale of the one and not the other, than there would be to attempt to found a distinction with respect to the power of the court to order a sale on the difference between a flock of sheep and a herd of cattle.\nIf courts of equity have the power, without legislation, to order the sale of the one, they have power to order the sale of the other, and since there is no question as to their power, with respect to the sale of the personal estate of an infant, we hold, for the reasons already stated, they may, in like manner, direct the sale of the real estate of an infant, lunatic, or idiot, whenever necessary for his support. All the reasons Ayhich we have mentioned as the grounds of the jurisdiction of a court of equity to order a sale of the personal estate of an infant, apply with more force, if possible, to the case of a lunatic or idiot.\nAn inquiry, for the purpose of determining whether there is a necessity for converting the real estate of a lunatic into money for his support in a particular case, is clearly the exercise of judicial power, and, since the primary object of all property rights is to provide the owner with means to relieve his wants and necessities, and, since every such owner therefore has the right to have his property applied for these purposes, and inasmuch as lunatics are unable to do this for themselves, and it is the peculiar province of courts of equity to enforce existing rights, when the the law affords no adequate remedy, as it certainly does not in cases of this character, it is not perceived, on principle, why courts of equity may not well assume jurisdiction in such cases; and it is hardly a sufficient answer to say the precedents are the other way, if well established principles sanction the jurisdiction.\nIt is conceded that if there was not an existing right in the lunatic to have his property applied for his support, then a court of equity would have no power or authority to interpose, for to do so would be an invasion of the rights of the legislature, or, in other words, it would be simply judicial legislation.\nAt the time of the application for an order for the sale of the land in controversy, there was no Lord Chancellor commissioned by the State with the power to provide for the wants and necessities of all lunatics and idiots within the State, nor was there any other tribunal, save a court of equity, authorized to act in the premises.\nMoreover, it must be borne in mind, that when this diversity in the jurisdiction exercised over infants and persons of unsound mind first obtained, courts of chancery were then in their infancy, and the principles upon which they acted were not so well defined and understood as they are now. At that time, their jurisdiction was confined in very narrow limits and was extended to comparatively but few subjects, and to hold that all matters over which they did not then assume jurisdiction is a sufficient reason for withholding equitable relief at the present time would be to deprive courts of equity of the greater portion of their jurisdiction. This we are not prepared to do. All who are conversant with the history of equity jurisprudence know that as a distinct system, it has been of constant growth and development from its inception to the present time, covering a period of hundreds of years. The jurisdiction of a court of equity does not depend upon the mere accident whether the court has, in some previous case or at some distant period of time, granted relief under similar circumstances, but rather upon the necessities of mankind, and the great principles of natural justice, which are recognized by the courts as a part of the law of the land, and which are applicable alike to all conditions of society, all ages, and all people. Precedents are useful as evidences of what the law is, and serve as guides in the application of those principles. Where it is clear the circumstances of the case in hand require an application of those principles, the fact that no precedent can be found in which relief has been granted under a similar state of facts is no reason for refusing it. Curtiss v. Brown, 29 Ill. 201; Voris v. Sloan, 68 id. 588.\nIt is not true, however, in point of fact, that courts of equity have never exercised jurisdiction over the persons and estates of lunatics and idiots. Ex parte Salisbury, 3 J. C. R. 347.\nIt is further claimed by appellant, that the proceeding by the conservator to sell the land was adversary to his ward, and therefore the ward should have been made a party, and that not having been done, the court was without jurisdiction to render any decree in the case. We do not regard the proceeding as adverse to the ward, but, on the contrary, for her benefit.\nThe petition prayed for a sale of the premises for the payment of existing indebtedness on account of her support and for her future maintenance, and, so far as its object was to provide means for her future support, it was clearly for her benefit, and it was not, therefore, necessary to make her a party.\nThe allegations in the petition were sufficient to give the court jurisdiction, and the decree must, therefore, be regarded as binding in all collateral proceedings, and its effect in this respect can not be changed, even admitting the proceeds of the sale were applied to an improper purpose, which we do not wish to be understood as at all intimating was done. This substantially disposes of the main objections against the validity of the decree, and sale by the conservator, and the conclusion reached, of course, renders it unnecessary to consider other questions which have been argued by counsel.\nFor the reasons stated, we are of opinion the decree of the circuit court should be affirmed, and it is, therefore, so ordered.\nDecree affirmed.-"},{"case_name":"The American Dock and Improvement Company, and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, complainants and appellants, v.

L. of 1870 p. 160.\nThe New Jersey West Line Railroad Company having located its route, representing that certain lands, in part under tide water and in part theretofore under tide water, happened to come within the location of the route of the depots, stations, and other works of said company, and were needed therefor, applied for a grant of the same. On the 19th of March, 1872, the governor,. attorney-general and riparian commissioners, pursuant to the ninth section of the act of 1872 above mentioned, executed a grant to the New Jersey West Line Railroad Company for the said lands, for the consideration of the sum of $125,000. The premises granted were described as follows : \u201c Commencing at a point in the east line of Warren street extended southerly at the southwesterly corner of the land granted to the Morris Canal and Banking Company, by an act of eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and from thence running westerly and parallel with Grand street, in Jersey City, twenty-eight hundred feet; thence northerly, at right angles with Grand street, five hundred feet; thence westerly and parallel with Grand street, to the original high-water mark on the west side of Communipaw bay or cove; thence returning to the place of beginning, and running easterly and parallel with Grand street, four hundred and forty feet along one of the southerly lines of the grants made to the Morris Canal and Banking Company, as aforesaid, to the centre line of Washington street extended southerly; thence southerly along said centre line of Washington street extended southerly, which is one of the westerly lines of said grant to the Morris Canal and Banking Company, and at right angles with Grand street, five hundred and thirteen feet; thence -westerly and parallel with Grand street, about thirty-six hundred and fifty feet, more or less, to a point in line with the centre line of Jersey avenue, in Jersey City, if the same were extended southerly to said point; thence southwesterly, in line with the said centre line of Jersey avenue, one hundred and sixty-five feet; thence westerly and parallel with Grand street, in Jersey City, about five hundred feet, more or less, to the original high-water mark on. the west side of the Communipaw bay or cove; thence northeasterly along said original high-water mark at Communipaw bay or cove, to the mouth of Mill creek; thence crossing said creek in a straight line and continuing northeasterly along said original high-water mark, until it intersects the end of the third course of this tract.\u201d\nThe grant was in fee simple, absolute and unqualified. For a portion of the consideration of the grant, the company gave to the trustees for the support of public schools, the joint bond of the company and Asa Packer for $82,000, secured by a mortgage on the premises granted.\nInterest being in arrear and unpaid, the trustees for the support of public schools, on the 26th day of April, 1875, filed a bill in the court of chancery for the foreclosure of the mortgage, and a decree for the foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged premises was obtained on the 22d day of October, 1875. Under this decree a sale was made on the 26th day of'December, 1878. The sale was set aside on application to the chancellor, on the ground of surprise and irregularities in conducting the sale. Trustees &c. v. N. J. West Line R. R. Co., 3 Stew. Eq. 494.\nNeither of the complainants was a party to the foreclosure suit, and in this condition of affairs they filed their bill, which gave rise to the decree appealed from.\nThe complainants\u2019 bill was filed on the 1st day of March, 1879. It claims title in the complainants, or some one of them, (1) as riparian owners; (2) under the wharf act of 1851; (3) under the act of 1860, authorizing the extension of the Central railroad from Elizabeth to some point or points on New York bay; (4) under the act of 1864, incorporating the American Dock and Improvement Company; and also, title by estoppel arising from expenditures in improvements made by tacit consent and sufferance of the state. In addition to a claim of title derived from these sources, the bill sets up a right in the Central Railroad Company, under a covenant contained in a grant made by the riparian commissioners to the Central Railroad Company on the 12th of November, 1874. By that instrument the riparian commissioners granted the company several .tracts of land under water, within designated boundaries, for the consideration of $300,000, excepting out of the same, among other things, whatever premises and privileges may have been granted to the New Jersey West Line Railroad Company by the supplement to its charter, and the grant made by the riparian commissioners in pursuance thereof, describing the premises by metes and bounds, in full, the same as contained in the grant to the West Line company of March 19th, 1872. Then follows the covenant in question, which is in these words: \u201c As to the premises included in the said grant to the New Jersey West Line Railroad Company, it is agreed as follows: that in case the said state had not the right and power to vest the title in the said New Jersey West Line Railroad Company, which is, in and by the ninth section of the act approved February 29th, 1872, entitled, \u2018 A supplement to an act entitled, An act to charter the Passaic Valley and Peapack Railroad Company, approved March 29th, 1865\/ and in and by the aforesaid grant, in pursuance thereof, provided to be vested in that company, which right and power the said state claims to have had, and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey claims that the said state did not have, then and in such case the said state shall, for the consideration of one dollar,-and for no other or further' consideration tobe paid to the state therefor, release to the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, free from any encumbrance thereon by mortgage given to the state, all its right, title and interest in the said premises mentioned and described in the said ninth section of said act, and in said grant to the said New Jersey West Line Railroad Company.\u201d\nIn this immediate connection the bill contained averments that the grant of the riparian commissioners to the West Line company was not within the purview of the ninth section of the act of 1872, as not being a grant of lands which \u201c happened to come \u201d within the location of the route of its railroad, because of the fraudulent character of such location. But the allegations on this head are foreign to the contents of the covenant in question. The condition expressed in the covenant, on which it is stipulated that the state shall release to the Central Railroad Company its right, title and interest in the premises, free from encumbrance, is dependent exclusively on the event of the state not having the right and power to vest the title in the West Line company, and not on the capacity of the West Line company to receive the grant. The grantee, having applied for and accepted the grant, could not, on the foreclosure of the consideration-money mortgage, set up the invalidity of the grant on the ground of its incapacity to receive it; nor does the cove nant in the grant to the Central Railroad Company contemplate a release of the rights of the state in the event simply of the grant to the West Line Company having been ineffective.\nThe bill adds an averment that the complainants are, and for a long time have been, in the peaceable possession of the premises, and have placed valuable and extensive improvements thereon.\nThe complainants\u2019 bill is an original bill. The state is not made a party to it; nor is there auy prayer for a conveyance by the state pursuant to the covenant. The parties made defendants are the Trustees for the Support of Public Schools, the New Jersey West Line Railroad Company, and William Z. Lamed, its receiver; Asa Packer, and the purchaser at the sheriff's sale, which has been set aside; and sundry mortgage and judgment creditors of the West Line company. John Taylor Johnston is also made a defendant, but his interest is with the complainants as trustee of a title which he holds for their benefit. The prayer of the bill is, that the lands and premises comprised within the so-called West Line grant may be declared, by decree, to be free from the cloud or encumbrance of the trustees\u2019 mortgage \u2014 that the title of the West Line company and of the trustees be decreed to be invalid \u2014 that the trustees be restrained from proceeding to sell the mortgaged premises, and that peaceable possession thereof by the complainants may be preserved; and for an injunction to restrain the sale of the mortgaged premises and the disturbance of the complainants\u2019 possession thereof.\nUpon filing the bill, the chancellor allowed a rule to show cause why an injunction should not issue, in accordance with the prayer of the bill, and enjoined all proceedings on the execution, which had been issued on the decree, until further order should be made. Answers were filed by the trustees, and by the executors of Asa Packer, in denial of the complainants\u2019 right to relief. Upon the bill, and these answers, and the affidavits annexed to the bill and answers, the argument of the rule to show cause was had. The chancellor discharged the rule, vacated the interim restraining order, and denied the injunction prayed for in the bill. From this order of the chancellor the complainants appealed.\nI assume that the bill is adapted to obtain relief under the act entitled, \u201c An act to compel the determination of claims to real estate in certain cases, and to quiet the title to the same,\u201d (P. L. of 1870 p. 20, Rev. 1189); for it was so considered by the chancellor, in his opinion. Independent of the covenant contained in the grant by the riparian commissioners to the Central Railroad Company, of November 12th, 1874 (which will presently be considered), the bill was designed to put the respective titles of the complainants, and of the West Line company, in a train for judicial determination. To a bill of such a scope, only, the state is not a necessary or proper party, for the state had parted with its entire title to the premises in dispute, by its grant to the West Line company, in 1872. It will also be observed that the order appealed from was one simply dissolving an interim injunction, and denying an injunction to stay a sale by the trustees under their foreclosure decree until the question of title should be determined. The complainants\u2019 bill was not dismissed, and the subject-matter of the litigation between the rival claimants to ownership of the property remains in the court of chancery, still undisposed of.\nOn this presentation of the case the sole topic for discussion is whether the trustees, in the situation of their foreclosure suit when this bill was filed, should, under the circumstances, be stayed from proceeding to a sale under their decree until a determination of the disputed title may be obtained. Except so far as shall be needful to decide the issue raised by the appeal, none of the interesting and important questions discussed so thoroughly by counsel will be adjudged or considered.\nThe trustees for the support of public schools are a board constituted for the administration of so much of the public revenue as is appropriated for the maintenance of public schools. It consists of the governor, the president of the senate, the speaker of the house, the attorney-general, the secretary of state, and the comptroller, for the time being. These public officials are constituted trustees of the fund for the support of public schools arising from appropriations made for that purpose, and it is provided that they should be known by the name, style and title of \u201c The Trustees for the Support of Public Schools.\u201d They are required to hold the public stocks and moneys appropriated by the state for the support of public schools, in trust \u2014 the interest and dividends arising therefrom to be applied by them, or a majority of them, for the support of public schools, as prescribed by the legislature from time to time, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever. The investment of the fund is directed to be made by the treasurer of the state under their direction, and in the name of \u201cThe Trustees for the Support of Public Schools.\u201d P. L. of 1867 p. 360, Rev. 1081. How far this public body is amenable to suits was given a prominent place in the discussion of counsel.\nBy the common law, no suit or action can be maintained against the sovereign; the remedy is by petition of right. 2 Dan.

But if the attorney-general, as the representative of the crown, files an information for the collection of crown revenues, he may be proceeded against by cross-bill for discovery and relief in aid of the defence. Deare v. Attorney-General, 1 Y. & C. Exch. 197. A foreign government cannot be sued in an English court; but if it files a bill in an equity court for the enforcement of a right, in such a suit the defendant may file a cross-bill for discovery touching the matters for which he is sued, and for relief by way of defence. King of Spain v. Hullet, 1 Cl. & Fin. 333; Prioleau v. United States, L. R. (2 Eq. Cas.) 659; United States v. Wagner, L. R. (2 Ch. App.) 582; Republic of Liberia v. Roye, L. R. (1 App. Cas.) 139. In certain cases where the interests of the crown are incidentally concerned, the attorney-general may be made a defendant to a bill in equity. In a suit between private individuals to subject goods of a debtor who had been outlawed to the payment of his debts, the attorney-general is a necessary party; and if he be omitted, a demurrer will lie or the cause be directed to stand over until he can be made a party. - v. Bromley, 2 P. Wms. 269; Balch v. Wastall, 1 Id. 445. In Stokes v. Holden, 1 Keen 145, a bill was filed to recover a legacy; the legatee had been convicted of felony; the attorney-general was made a party to the bill for the purpose of having the question decided whether upon the conviction the legacy did not. pass to the crown by forfeiture. In Dolder v. Bank of England, 10 Ves. 352, the court refused to order dividends of stock purchased by the old government of Switzerland to be paid into court on the application of the new government, until the attorney-general was made a party, in view of a possible claim that the property passed to the crown as property derelict. In Barclay v. Russell, 3 Ves. 424, the controversy was over bank stock purchased by the government of Maryland before the American war; and, as appears on page 435 of the report of the case, the attorney-general was made a defendant and filed an answer. In Baker v. Sutton, 1 Keen 224, the attorney-general was made a party defendant to a bill filed to determine the validity of a charitable bequest. In all cases of charitable bequests, except where the bequest is to an officer of an established institution, the attorney-general is a necessary party to the bill, because the king, as parens patriae, superintends all such charities and acts by the attorney-general, who is his proper officer in this respect. Wellbeloved v. Jones, 1 Sim. & Stu. 40.

Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. \u00a7 44, note.\nExemption from liability to be sued is the personal privilege of the sovereign; and if there be any officer of the government who is its representative with respect to the particular matter of the suit, he may be made a party to the suit, though the litigation concerns the public revenues. Practical illustrations of the application-of this principle are common. In State on the prosecution of the M. &. E. R. R. Co. v. Yard, a suit was prosecuted against the commissioner of railroad taxation, an officer of the state, to restrain the collection of taxes assessed, and a decision was had by the supreme court of the United States that the assessment was invalid as against the prosecutor. 8 Vr. 228 ; 95 U. S. 104.\nThe property in the fund set apart for the support of the public schools is by law vested exclusively in the trustees to hold on the trusts declared by the statute. They are made custodians of the fund, free, by constitutional provision, from even the control of the legislature, except in the designation of the mode of application to the support of public schools. The investments of it are required to be in the name of \u201c The Trustees for the Support of the Public Schools.\u201d Mortgages are taken by their statutory title, and suits are prosecuted in that title for the foreclosure of such mortgages. For the purposes of the administration of the fund of which they are made . custodians, and of the rights and remedies upon or against the securities in which it is invested, the trustees are constituted the representatives of the state. Suits brought in the name of the trustees for the foreclosure of mortgages are subject to the same defences by answer or cross-bill as like suits by other mortgagees. In a suit such as the complainants have brought, a mortgagee of the owner of the adverse title is a proper but not a necessary party. Though the complainants may not be able, as against the trustees, to present some of their grounds for relief, for the reason that the trustees are not the proper parties to litigate them, the trustees were properly made parties to this bill, and the relief prayed may, if the grounds of it are otherwise sufficient, be decreed against them.\nThe complainants seek the relief prayed for on two grounds:\nFirst. The complainants rely on the covenant contained in the grant made by the riparian commissioners to the Central Railroad Company. The bill construes this covenant as an agreement by the state to release the premises, to discharge the mortgage in question, and that it would not dispose of the title to the premises by foreclosure dr otherwise until it should be determined whether said title is valid as against the title of the Central Railroad Company and those holding under them. The covenant is executory in terms and legal effect, and can only be executed by a bill for a specific performance. To such a bill the state is a necessary party, and the trustees are not its representatives in such a litigation. In the next place, the covenant, if the riparian commissioners were competent to make it, is inop erative and void as against the trustees\u2019 mortgage. By the constitution, \u201c The fund for the support of free schools, and all money, stock and other property which may hereafter be appropriated for that purpose, or received into the treasury under the provision of any law heretofore passed, to augment the said fund, shall be securely invested, and remain a perpetual fund; and the income thereof, except so much as it may be judged expedient to apply to an increase of the capital, shall be annually appropriated to the support of public schools for the equal benefit of all the people of the state; and it shall not be competent for the legislature to borrow, appropriate or use the said fund or any part thereof for any other purpose, under any pretence whatever.\u201d Art. IV. \u00a7 7 \u00b6 6. By an act passed on the 6 th of April, 1871, entitled \u201c An act to increase the school fund of the state,\u201d it was enacted that \u201c all moneys hereafter received from the sales and rentals of the land under water belonging to the state shall be paid over to the trustees of the school fund, and appropriated for the support of free public schools, and shall be held by them in trust for that purpose, and shall be invested by the treasurer of the state under their direction in the same manner as the funds now held by them are invested ; the same to constitute a part of the permanent school fund of the state, and the interest thereof to be applied to the support of public schools in the mode which now is or hereafter may be directed by law, and to no other use or purpose whatever.\u201d P. L. of 1871 p. 98; Bev.p. 1081 \u00a7 67. By the ninth section of the act of 1872, under which the West Line grant was made, it was provided that the consideration of the grant should be paid by the company to the trustees of the school fund. Instead of receiving the consideration-money in cash, the trustees, for part of it, took a bond secured by this mortgage. The mortgage was executed, delivered and accepted by the trustees. The appropriation of the money secured by it was consummated, and it became a part of the perpetual school fund, within the meaning of the constitutional provision, and is protected by it. The legislature could not borrow, appropriate or use it for any other purpose than that for which it was set apart.\nThe mortgage was made in 1872; the grant to the Central Railroad Company was not made until 1874. The riparian commissioners had no power in 1874 to release or discharge a mortgage which before that time was an investment of part of the school fund. The legislature, itself could not impair the security or discharge the mortgage except by passing an equivalent into the treasury for the benefit of the school fund. The title of the trustees, and of any purchaser at the sale of the mortgaged premises, may fail because of its inherent infirmity, but it cannot be impaired by a covenant with respect to the mortgaged premises, made by the riparian commissioners after the mortgage was executed and delivered.\nSecond. The other ground for relief is a claim of title in the complainants anterior to the grant to the West Line and to the mortgage of the trustees. If the title claimed by the complainants is clothed with the qualities and circumstances set forth in the bill, a sale in the foreclosure suit will not affect it. The complainants were not parties to the foreclosure suit and would not be concluded by the record; the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, though not a purchaser pendente lite with respect to the suit, would take his title with notice actual or constructive of the complainants\u2019 rights, and may be made a party to this suit for the purpose of litigating the title of the West Line company under its grant. If the complainants are entitled to restrain a sale under the trustees\u2019 foreclosure suit, it must be in virtue of some collateral equity which would justify such a measure of relief.\nBefore discussing this subject, it will be appropriate to consider for a moment, the claim put forth by the complainants\u2019 counsel, on the argument, for relief, under the answer of Larned, the receiver of the West Line company. This answer appears in the record sent up to this court, but was not before the chancellor on the hearing on which the order appealed from was made. It was not filed until the 9th of February, 1880. Larned, in his answer, affirms the validity of the title of the West Line company, but charges that it would be inequitable to dispose of the title by foreclosure, or otherwise, until its validity as against the claim of title by the complainants should be determined, suggesting an equity in the mortgagor to have the foreclosure sale made upon an unclouded title. Aside from the fact that this answer was not before the chancellor when he made his order, it cannot avail the complainants on this appeal. If a mortgagor be entitled to have a sale under foreclosure proceedings delayed, until it may be made under circumstances advantageous to his interests, he should seek the indulgence in the foreclosure suit. In the next place, the complications which may have cast a cloud upon the mortgagor\u2019s title, arose before this mortgage was made. The mortgagor took its title from the state, with full knowledge of the situation of the premises granted. A mere defect in the title conveyed would have afforded no defence in the foreclosure suit, though the mortgage had been given directly for the purchase-money. O\u2019Brien v. Hulfish, 7 C. E. Gr. 471. The covenant in the grant by the riparian commissioners, in 1874, to the Central Railroad Company, could not impair or affect the mortgagor\u2019s title, if title passed under the grant of 1872. If the covenant was made inconsiderately, and tends to impair the salable value of the mortgaged premises, it was an act for which the mortgagees are in nowise responsible. A mortgagor who mortgages an embarrassed title, or whose title has subsequently become clouded, cannot, in the absence of fraud, have the foreclosure proceedings held back on account of an apprehension that the mortgaged premises will not bring full value at a foreclosure sale. His remedy is by redemption.\nIn searching for an equity to entitle the complainants to an injunction to stay a sale until the validity of the contested title is settled, it must be borne in mind that the titles of the contestants, respectively, are legal titles. Even the rights of the complainants, claimed in the bill, as derived by estoppel, must be considered as a legal title \u2014 a title acquired by a riparian owner by reclamation. It can have no other foundation as against the state. Independent of the statute, a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the dispute. The statute confers a jurisdiction of this character to settle the title to lands only where the complainant is in peaceable posses sion, and no suit be pending to enforce or test the validity of the adverse title, claim or encumbrance. Rev. p. 1189. I do not propose to discuss the question whether the bill was properly filed against the West Line company under this statute. Such a discussion is not necessary to the subject under review\u2014 whether the chancellor should have enjoined the mortgagees from a sale under the decree of foreclosure.\nThe decree was regularly obtained in the orderly prosecution of proceedings for foreclosure. The stay of execution and sale under the decree is sought by parties who were not parties to the foreclosure suit, and against whose claim of title a sale will be destitute of all legal force. A court of equity will ordinarily not interfere to enjoin a sale of lands under an execution against one person, the title to which is claimed by another, for the manifest reason that the sale will not prejudice the rights of the latter, and the question of title is properly triable in a court of law. Freeman v. Elmendorf, 3 Hal. Ch. 475; S. C. on appeal, Id. 655. To warrant resort to the restraining power of the court, the case, must present some recognized ground for equitable relief \u2014 fraud, or irreparable injury.\nMr. High, speaking on this subject, says : \u201c While the cases on this subject are far from reconcilable, the clear weight of authority is in favor of the proposition that, in the absence of fraud or gross injustice and irremediable injury, courts of equity will not entertain jurisdiction in restraint of judicial sales under executions against third persons having no title to the property sold.\u201d High on Inj. \u00a7 266. Another principle which enters into the consideration of the matter presented by this appeal is, that courts interfere with great reluctance with the collection of the public revenues. Jersey City v. Lembeck, 4 Stew. Eq. 465, is an illustrative precedent: The city had laid an assessment on the complainant\u2019s lands, which, by the city charter, was an encumbrance ; the assessment was invalid; no suit was pending in which the validity of the encumbrance could be tested. The complainant filed a bill under the statute against the city to settle the title to the land and determine the validity of the encumbrance. This court denied relief, on the ground that the complainant might have had relief by a writ of certiorari, which he had lost by his own laches. To justify resort to a court of equity to stay the collection of public revenues, the party must make a case strictly within the bounds of equity jurisdiction\u2014 an injury otherwise not remediable; and he must seek and prosecute his remedy with promptitude.\nThe trustees\u2019 mortgage is an investment of a fund, the interest of which the statute and the constitution contemplate shall be applied annually to the support of public schools. The amount due on the mortgage when the decree was signed, by the accumulation of interest unpaid, had reached the sum of $99,345.80.\nOn the 8th of January, 1870, an information was filed in the court of chancery by the attorney-gen eral in the name'of the state, against the Central Railroad Company, complaining of encroachments upon lands of the state which included the parcel afterwards granted to the West Line company. In this suit the title of the complainants might have been presented for determination. On the 24th of December, 1870, the attorney-general filed a petition supplemental to the information, asking an injunction, on which a rule to show cause was granted, and a temporary injunction was allowed restraining the Central Railroad Company from making improvements' on the premises. This injunction order was continued by consent until a final-hearing should be had. The act authorizing the grant to the West Line company was passed February 29th, 1872. By this act the trustees were authorized to require payment in cash of the consideration of any grant that might be made under its provisions. In lieu of cash they consented to accept for part of the consideration the mortgage in question as an investment for the benefit of the school fund. The West Line grant, although it bears date on the 19th of March, 1872, was not in fact executed and delivered until about the 21st of May, 1872. On the 25th of May, 1872, formal notice of the grant was served on the officers of the Central Railroad Company by the West Line Company; and on the 27th of February, 1873, the Central Railroad company filed its answer to the information of the attorney-general, in which, while denying the power of the state to make the West Line grant, it set up the grant in bar of the right of the state to proceed with the information.\nThe foreclosure bill was filed April 26th, 1875, and a final decree taken October 22d, 1875. On the 10th of January, 1876, Mr. Johnston, to whom the complainants had made conveyance of the premises for the purpose of giving the federal courts jurisdiction over this controversy, filed in the circuit court of the United States for the district of New Jersey a bill of the same import as the bill in this case, asking substantially the same relief and an injunction staying a sale under the foreclosure decree, which injunction, not having been renewed at the next succeeding term, expired by force of the rules and practice of the federal courts, and was, on the 30th of November, 1878, discharged on motion of 'the attorney-general. The complainants\u2019 bill was not filed until the 1st of March, 1879.\nBy reason of delays consequent on this litigation, down to this period, the trustees have not been able to realize the interest on this fund, which by law should have been applied annually to the support of the public schools. The mortgaged premises will now bring at a sale the amount due on the decree, although, with interest and costs, it nearly equals the price for which the premises were sold to the mortgagor. There is no reason to suspect that the trustees are permitting the decree to be used in the interest of either of the principals in the litigation, or are pressing the sale from any other than the laudable purpose of securing the money for the public treasury, and enabling them to receive and apply the interest which may accumulate upon it to the use to which it is devoted. These public officers, in the execution of the trust confided to them, have a well-fortified claim that they shall be permitted to administer this fund and apply it as the law prescribes, and that investments of it should not be subjected to the delay and vicissitudes of a litigation that promises to be uncommonly protracted, with a possible result that at the end the morgaged premises may be inadequate to satisfy the decree and accumulated interest, or their mortgage title be entirely defeated.\nThe bond taken by the chancellor on setting aside the former sale is no answer to the urgency of the trustees that the property shall be again sold. Ample as the sureties on the bond are, it is no equivalent for a vendible mortgage estate which, in the market, will bring the money. For one contingency the bond is no security whatever. Its condition is, that on a resale the premises shall bring the amount then due on the execution for debt, interest and costs, together with the lawful expenses. The condition does not apply in the event of the complainants\u2019 success in this suit in obtaining the injunction prayed for, perpetually enjoining a sale. It leaves the hazard of that result upon the mortgagees. Nor does the bond fulfill the purposes for which the collection of the mortgage-money is urged. The trustees are entitled to have the money invested so that the interest may be available for use annually in the support of the public schools.\nThe surety on the trustees\u2019 bond has equities, too, that cannot be lightly regarded. Plis estate has no indemnity for his liability on the bond except the vendible value of the mortgaged premises, and the obligation of a bankrupt corporation in the hands of a receiver. Now the indemnity from the first source is ample. A sale of the mortgaged premises will pay the debt. His executors have filed an answer praying a sale of the mortgaged premises for the purpose of securing a release of the estate of the deceased from liability on the bond. They submit to the court that, if the title asserted by the complainants should turn out to be superior to that granted by the state to the West Line company, the complainants have no equity as against the estate of their decedent to hinder, delay or prevent a sale of the mortgaged premises. The force of this prayer seems to me to be undeniable. It presents considerations of pre-eminent weight on an application to a court of equity for a discretionary writ, which is never allowed except on a clear preponderance of equity on the side of the applicant.\nAgainst the equities of the trustees and the surety on the bond, the complainants oppose equities derived from two sources. First, they say that if the premises are sold in the foreclosure suit, and are purchased by other parties, the Central Railroad Company will lose the improvements made upon them, in case the West Line grant proves to be valid. Inasmuch as the title of the Central Railroad Company might have been tested and determined in the information suit of 1870, which was pending when the West Line grant was made, this contention has little weight as against the mortgagees and the surety on the bond. The complainants may dispel the risk of an issue unfavorable to their title by redemption of the mortgage, or by purchasing at the sale. Having delayed, if not evaded, a trial of title in the information suit, the complainants, after the mortgagor has become insolvent and the foreclosure suit has been prosecuted to a final decree, have no equity to subject the surety to delay, and the consequent risk that the mortgaged premises may finally be inadequate to satisfy the mortgage debt, or to cast upon the mortgagees the risk of an unfavorable termination of this litigation.\nThe other ground of the complainants for equitable relief is based on the covenant contained in the grant of the riparian commissioners to the Central Railroad Company in 1874. I have shown that this covenant is legally inoperative against the trustees\u2019 mortgage. The defendants\u2019 counsel push this matter further. They contend that the covenant is invalid as against the state, for want of power in the riparian commissioners to bind the state by covenants not annexed to the lands actually granted. A discussion of this problem at this time would lead beyond the bounds proposed by this opinion, and is not necessary to the question proposed to be decided; for the complainants\u2019 counsel place their argument on this head on matters collateral to the grant, and independent of the validity of the covenant. They say that for the grant the Central Railroad Company paid into the state treasury the sum of $300,000, which went into and became part of the school fund. Upon this fact they contend that the trustees are equitably estopped from repudiating the covenant and selling away the premises, so that the execution of the covenant by a grant of the premises in compliance with it would be made impracticable.\nThe equitable doctrine invoked is that a party who accepts a benefit must take it eum onere. He cannot have the advantage of one part of a transaction which enures to his benefit and repudiate other parts which are advantageous to the other party. If he voluntarily accepts a benefit from the transaction with knowledge of its import, he ratifies it as a whole, and he cannot repudiate its obligations without first restoring the consideration he has received. He must elect between entire repudiation, with a restoration of the benefits received under it, and complete adoption of the proceeding with all its obligations. The equity of a party who relies on an equitable estoppel to give validity to an inefficient contract is not to have his contract made binding, but to put his adversary to an election between performance of the contract and repudiation of it upon equitable terms.\nThe doctrine of equitable estoppel presupposes that the person against whom it is set up has the volition to accept or reject the proffered benefit, and power to restore the consideration if received. The endeavor to apply it to this case springs from a misconception of the relations between the trustees for the support of public schools and the riparian commissioners, and of the powers and duties of the trustees in the management of the school fund. The trustees have no control over the state\u2019s lands under water. Whatever control the state has given over these lands it has entrusted to the riparian commissioners, an independent legislative board. The trustees have no authority to decide what lands under water shall or shall not be sold, or to fix the price or dictate the terms and conditions on which sales shall be made, nor power to rescind contracts of sale made by the riparian commissioners, which they may deem prejudicial to the school fund. They have not even the capacity to determine from what sources the revenues for the support of public schools shall be derived \u2014 no choice as to what moneys shall or shall not become part of the school fund. These are matters exclusively within legislative discretion. The powers and duties of the trustees in relation to the school fund are purely executive and ministerial \u2014 to invest the fund and appropriate its income annually to the support of public schools. They could not lawfully abstract from the school fund the money needed, on the principles of equitable estoppel, to effect a rescission of the grant to the Central Railroad Company, on the hypothesis that the grant was injurious to the interests of public schools. When moneys accumulated from legislative grants become part of the school fund, the legislature is prohibited by constitutional inhibition from withdrawing them or impairing investments of them, directly or indirectly. The constitutional protection of the school fund would be of little avail if another legislative board, by contracts it might make, could produce the same result by an equitable estoppel, against which the trustees, in whose custody the school fund is lodged, cannot relieve themselves.\nThe people of this state have shown the utmost solicitude for the integrity of this fund. Considerations of public policy require that the courts should give to the fund the full measure of protection the constitution has placed over it, and should, as far as consistent with the rules of law, resist every effort to impair the investments of the fund, or embarrass the trustees in the administration of it in the manner prescribed by law. It is undeniable that a. stay of the collection of this mortgage until this litigation shall be ended \u2014 depriving the trustees of the yearly interest, which should be applied annually to the support of schools \u2014 would prevent the .trustees performing a public duty obligatory upon them with respect to this part of the fund. The Central Railroad Company accepted its covenant with notice of the trustees\u2019 mortgage, and of the nature of the trust on which the investment was made \u2014 knowing that the covenant was not legally binding upon the trustees, and chargeable with knowledge that it was the duty of the trustees to collect the mortgage whenever the- investment failed to bring in interest for use annually for the support of public schools. Having accepted the covenant with knowledge of the condition of affairs, the company has no equity to interpose the inconvenience and embarrassments that might arise to it from that source between the trustees and the duties these public officers are required to perform. It is said that the state, recognizing its obligation under the covenant made by the riparian commissioners, will make good to the school fund the money secured by this mortgage; but, until that be actually done, I do not see how the anticipation that it may be done can be made to square with the .constitutional provision that the legislature cannot borrow or appropriate the fund to any use other than the purposes for which it is held by the trustees.\nBut if it should be conceded that, out of this covenant and the circumstances surrounding it, an equity might arise in favor of the complainants as against the mortgagees to have a sale of the mortgaged premises postponed until the title to the premises should be settled, these facts can be of no avail against the personal representatives of the surety on the bond. His obligation was entered into before the covenant was made. Neither he nor the corporation he was interested in, has derived any advantage from it. So far as their interests are concerned, the covenant was designed in hostility to the title of the West Line company, under its grant, to give the complainants a supposed better standpoint from which to controvert its validity.\nThe covenant will create am equity in the complainants to be allowed to redeem the mortgage and be subrogated to the right of the mortgagees in the decree, so far as to give protection against a sale under it pending this litigation \u2014 subject, however, to the equities of the personal representatives of the surety on the bond. The covenant, if it be valid and binding on the state, may serve to confer on the covenantee a standing on which to controvert the power of the state to make a grant of land under water to any other person than the adjacent riparian owner. It may also, in that event, lay the foundation of a claim to re-imbursement by the state of the outlay incurred in the redemption of the mortgage, on the happening of the contingency on which the covenant was made to depend. But it cannot be made available to the complainants against the indisputable equity of the mortgagees and of the personal representatives of the surety on the bond, to have the mortgage and the liability of the surety taken out of this litigation and disposed of in the condition of affairs as they were when the mortgage was given and the obligation of the surety was incurred.\nThe decree of the chancellor denying the injunction should be affirmed.\nDeoree unanimously affirmed."},{"case_name":"William H. Webb et al. agt. The Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of New York et al.","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/4544031\/","date":"1882-09-01","court":"New York Supreme Court","content":"Macomber, J.\nThe plaintiffs bring themselves within the provisions of chapter 531 of the Laws of 1881, entitled \u201cAn act for the protection of taxpayers,\u201d by which persons who are taxpayers in municipal corporations may bring and maintain actions to prevent the officers of such corporations from executing or performing illegal acts.\nThe object of this action is to restrain the defendants from carrying into effect the provisions of chapter 456 of the Laws of 1881, on the ground that such act is unconstitutional. That law is entitled \u201cAn act for the removal of the reservoir situate in the city of \u00a1New York, between Fortieth and Forty-second streets.\u201d By the first section thereof the reservoir is declared to be abandoned, and the commissioner of public works of the city is directed, within six months from the passage of the act, to remove the pipes which connect with the reservoir and to lay a main in Fifth avenue, between Fortieth and Forty-second streets, so as to connect the mains now leading in and out of the reservoir. By the same section the commissioner is directed to remove the structure and grade the ground now occupied by the reservoir to the level of the adjacent streets in a suitable manner for the purpose of a park, all of which is to be accomplished within a year from the passage of the act.\nBy the second section the cost and expenses of the removal of the pipes and the laying of the new main are directed to be raised by tax upon the real and personal property of the city which may be included in the tax levy of the years 1881 and 1882. The cost of removal of the structure and of grading the ground occupied by it is directed to be paid by the owners of property bounded by the westerly side of Sixth avenue and southerly side of Thirty-seventh street, and easterly side of Madison avenue and the northerly side of Forty-fifth street.\nBy the third section the comptroller of thp city was authorized to pay the cost and expenses of' the improvement, and in order to make the same he was authorized and empowered and directed to issue revenue bonds of the city, which should bear such a rate of interest as the comptroller' should deem proper, not exceeding, however, six per cent per annum, which should be sold at not less than par.\nBy the fourth section the land occupied by the reservoir, \u25a0\u25a0 together with the adjacent land lying west thereof known as Beservoir square, was directed to be converted into a public park to be laid out by and under the control and management of the park commissioners, and kept and maintained by them as one of the public parks of the city of Hew York.\nThe fifth section prohibited the use of such park for military parades, drills, inspections or reviews of any kind.\nIt is claimed, and I think justly, that the act in question is unconstitutional because it was passed in violation of the sixteenth section of the third article of the constitution of the state, which declares \u201c that no private or local bill which shall be passed shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\u201d By the title of the act the only subject mentioned is the removal of the reservoir, while the body of the act itself, though providing for such removal, is directed mainly to the establishment of a public park in the city of Hew York. Undoubtedly if the act had been entitled \u201cAn act for converting the reservoir into a public park,\u201d the demolition of the structure itself might have been necessarily implied by the very -terms of the act. But the converse of this is by no means true. So far as the title of the act informs us the ultimate purpose for which the structure should be removed might lie the erection of a government building or the parceling out of the land among the adjacent owners.\nBut it is contended, on the part of the defendants, that though the act may be unconstitutional and void in so far as it attempts to establish a public park, yet it may be saved for the purposes for which it is properly entitled. It is true that a portion of the act follows legitimately its title, and hence if the mere destruction of the masonry composing the reservoir was in the line of legitimate legislation, the act would not be open to this objection. The general rule that that portion of a statute which is constitutional shall be saved though a part of it is unconstitutional admits of this qualification, namely, that the legislation shall seem, upon its face at least, to be proper and intelligent. This is so stated by judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional Limitations, in language, adopted in the court of appeals in the case of The People agt. Briggs (50 N. Y., 566), as follows: \u201c But if the act is broader than the title, it may happen that one part of the act stand because indicated by the\" title, while as to the object not indicated by the title it must fall. Some of the state constitutions, it will be observed, have declared that this shall be the rule; but the declaration was unnecessary, as the general rule that so much of the act as is not in conflict with the constitution must be sustained would have required the same declaration by the courts. If by striking from the act all that relates to the object not indicated by the title, that which is left is complete in itself, sensible, capable of being executed, and wholly independent of that which is rejected, it must be sustained as constitutional. The principal questions in each case will therefore be whether the act is, in truth, broader than the title; and if so, then whether the other objects in the act are so intimately connected with the one indicated by the title that the portion of the act relating to them cannot be rejected and leave a complete and sensible enactment which shall be capable of being executed.\u201d\nThe passage quoted has special application to this case. \"Without the provisions relating to a public park, and the means of paying the expenses of malting the same, no intimation of which is made in the title of the act, there remains only the statute enacted for the purpose of the destruction of valuable property. No claim is made that the reservoir is a nuisance, in that its maintenance may endanger life, limb or health. It does not, therefore, come within the rule above stated, that the part of the act which may be saved from this constitutional objection shall be intelligent, or, as judge Cooley puts it, \u201c sensible.\u201d Suppose, for instance, that the act had required the commissioner of public works of the city of Hew York to demolish the statuary in Union square, could it be claimed that the act was in the line of legitimate legislation and intelligent ? Clearly it could not. This is by no means a technical objection. A constitutional objection cannot be technical. In civil cases there are no degrees in offenses against the organic law.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the act in question is open to the objection that it is contrary to the constitutional provision above referred to, and that for this reason the defendants should be restrained from carrying its provisions into effect.\nBut a more interesting question is presented by the claim made1 in behalf of the plaintiffs, that the act is unconstitutional because it violates the rights of property of the city of Hew York. The land which is covered by the reservoir, together with the land west of it known as Reservoir square, was granted in fee simple to the city by what is known as the \u201c Dongan charter,\u201d in 1686. That charter is substantially embraced in the Montgomerie charter, so calledj of 1730. The third section of the Dongan charter is as follows: \u201cAnd I do by these presents give and grant to the said mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the said city of Hew'York, all the waste, vacant, unpatented and unappropriated lands, lying and being within the said city of Hew York\u2019, and on Manhattan island aforesaid, extending and reaching to low-water mark, in and by and through all parts of the said city of Hew York and Manhattan island aforesaid, together with all rivers, rivulets, coves, creeks, ponds, waters and water courses in the said city and island, or either of them, not heretofore given or granted by any of the former governors, lieutenants or commanders-in-chief, under their or some of their hands and seals, or seal of the province, or by any of the former mayors or deputy mayors and aldermen of the said city of Hew York.\u201d By the sixth section it is provided that \u201c the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of \u00a1New York be and shall be forever hereafter, persons able and in law capable to have, get, receive and possess lands, tenements, rents, liberties, jurisdictions, franchises and hereditaments to them and their successors in fee simple or for a term of life, lives or years, or otherwise. * * * And also to give, grant, let, set and assign the same lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods and chattels; and to do and execute all other things about the same, by the name aforesaid,\u201d\nThe same power is reiterated and restated in the .twelfth section and in the fourteenth section. The same rights were restated in the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh sections of the \u00a1Montgomerie charter. The last charter was confirmed by the colonial legislature in 1732, and again by the constitutions of 1777, of 1821, and of 1846.\nThe lands in question, therefore, are owned by the city in fee simple absolute. This was so held in the case of Furman agt. New York (5 Sandf. [S. C.], 16), and in the same case (10 N. Y., 567). If, therefore, the legislature has undertaken by its acts to destroy the property of this corporation, or to deprive the city of its use, without just compensation, it has violated a fundamental law of the state. Chancellor \u00a1Kent (City Charter in Font's Notes), in commenting upon the provisions of the ancient charters of the city, says: \u201c It may not he amiss to state here, once for all, that it is an acknowledged and settled principle that no vested right of property, whether it belongs to private individuals or be in the shape of a corporate franchise, can ever be lawfully taken away without some default or forfeiture to be ascertained by a fair trial and pronounced by judicial decree. The English statute of Magna Charta establishes as a great principle the sanctity of rights and privileges then existing or thereafter to be lawfully procured ; and that principle was intended to be of general and perpetual application. It provided that the city of London, and all other cities, should have all their liberties and free customs; and that no freeman should be disseized of Ms freehold or liberties, or free customs but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. Corporate franchises in this country rest on a basis which ought to be at least as solid as Magna Charta, for they are founded on grants which are contracts, and \u2018 no state,\u2019 says the Constitution of the United States, \u2018can pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\u2019 \u201d\nI perceive no difference between the tenure of property thus held by the city and the proprietary rights of natural persons or private corporations. This privilege, however, is peculiar in this state to the city of Hew York. Its corporate name is the same that it has had for upwards of two hundred years, long antedating the organization of the state as an independent political entity. And while it was doubtless competent, when the British rule ceased, for the state to take from the city of Hew York its property rights and privileges, as an episode of the revolution, it is sufficient to say that, it did not see fit to do so. Having once recognized such rights by the organic law of 1777, and having become, ten years afterwards, amenable to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, by which it was prohibited to pass any law impairing the obligations of contracts, it is not, in my judgment, competent for the state; under cover of exercising political powers, to take away from the city any vested rights of property. It seems to me that such rights are as indestructible by legislative act as are the property rights of citizens.\nHor is this property, with other real estate owned by the city, held in trust for any person, nor is it stamped with any mere political trust of which the city may be deprived and thus its claim to the right to the possession of the property destroyed. The title to the land rests somewhere, and, as has been shown above, so far as the records extend, no one claims it except the city itself. Ho one has been in possession of it except the city. So that no necessary rights have been acquired by any person adverse to the city. Hence I say that the complete title of the city to the lands in question is not merely inferentially saved, but is expressly saved to the city by the thirteenth section of article first of the' state constitution, which says that \u201c the entire and absolute property is vested in the owners according to the nature of their respective estates.\u201d The idea of a trust under such circumstances, it seems to me, involves a contradiction in terms. How can a trust be attached to a title in fee simple of land 1 In trust for whom ? If for anybody other than municipal corporation, it would be the inhabitants of Manhattan island. But the mayor, aldermen and commonalty, the entity which owns the title of the real estate, are the people of Manhattan island. The owner, then, and cestui que trust are the same, and that a person should hold anything in trust for himself is a legal solecism.\nIt seems to me that the weight of authority is to the effect that the property which Hew York holds in its proprietary or private character, though originally derived from the power claiming the ultimate title, and which concerns the private advantage of the corporation, as a distinct legal personalty, is stamped with so many of the lights and powers of natural persons or private corporations as that the city cannot be deprived of this reservoir without due process of law and without just compensation. It admits of no doubt that the legislature may change, modify, enlarge or restrain the powers of a corporation which it has created. But whenever this is done, and a municipal corporation is relieved of the privilege and duty of maintaining a jurisdiction over the property and property rights, care has invariably been taken to restore to the original owner or proprietor the rights which the municipal corporation were for a time permitted to exercise (Ferret agt. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 52; 2 Kent's Commentaries, 257; Dartmouth College case, 4 Wheat., 694; People agt. Detroit, 28 Mich., 228; Bailey agt. Mayor, &c., of New York, 3 Hill, 531; People agt. Fields, 58 N. Y., 591; People agt. Ingersoll, Id., 1; Maxmillian agt. New York, 62 N. Y., 160).\nMr. justice Cooley\u2019s language in the Detroit Park case, is: \u201c The constitutional principle that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law applies to artificial persons as well as natural, and to municipal corporations in their private capacity as well as to corporations for manufacturing and commercial purposes; and when a local convenience or need is to be supplied, in which the people of the state at large, or any portion thereof outside of the city limits, are not concerned, the state can no more, by process of taxation, take from the individual citizens the. money to purchase it than they could, if it had been procured, appropriate it to the state use. To this extent the corporate rights appear to us to be a clear and undoubted exception to the general power of control which is vested in a state.\u201d The court there held that the city-of Detroit had a right to. decide for itself whether or not it would purchase a public park, and that an act to compel the city to purchase it against its will was held to be unconstitutional. See, also, Montpelier agt. East Montpelier (29 Vt.), where Ishah, J., says: \u201cIt has uniformly been held that towns and other public corporations may have private rights and interests vested in them under their charter, and as to those rights they are to be regarded and protected the same as if they were the rights and interests of individuals or private corporations; and grants of property in trust for other than corporate and municipal use (that is* as we understand for private as distinguished from public purposes) are no more the subject of legislative control than are the private and vested rights of individuals (See, also, Savings Society agt. Philadelphia, 31 Penn. St., 183; People agt. Bachellor, 53 N. Y., 128, 141; Bailey agt. Mayor and Aldrich agt. Tritt, 11 R. I., 141; Weismer agt. Village of Douglass, 64 N. Y., 91).\nThe learned counsel for the defendants do not claim that the legislature may deprive the city of property which it owns in fee, but they argue that the legislature may direct .vhat use such pr\u00f3perty shall be, put to by the city, and may prescribe what department of the corporation shall manage it. Within certain limits this contention may be conceded to be correct. Indeed, in the exercise of its superintending and governmental powers, as parens patriae, the legislature doubtless may designate the particular instrument in the varied and somewhat complex machinery of this vast municipality, for discharging its duties and for the protection of its rights. But I cannot assent to the proposition that the state may, absolutely and unqualifiedly, direct the use which shall be made by the city of its property held in' fee when the use named, by necessary intendment, and the mode adopted of changing an old public use to another, involves a denial of all the-essentials entering into proprietorship.\nThe case of Darlington agt. The Mayor, etc. (31 N. Y., 164), decided only the question which was before the court, namely, that the act of 1855, for compensating parties whose property may be destroyed in consequence of mobs or riots, was constitutional, and that judgments rendered against the oity of Hew York for such cause have the same force against the property of the city as judgments rendered for any other cause of action. It seems to me, regarding only the thing there actually adjudged, instead of this being an authority against the relief sought by the plaintiffs, that it is directly in the line of the views hereinbefore expressed, because it decides that the property which the city holds as proprietor, or absolute owner, is liable to satisfy judgments against the city, while the property held for strictly public uses is not. It is frequently said that the power to alienate property is a test of ownership; but it is hardly -as certain a test as the liability of that property to be taken away, in 'invitum, by execution.\nThe other cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, though involved in one way or another in the question so elaborately argued, do not, in view of the grounds selected for my decision, require special comment.\nJudgment must be ordered for the plaintiffs."},{"case_name":"Russell v. Allen","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/3500025\/","date":"1882-10-01","court":"Supreme Court of the United States","content":"Mr. Justice Gray\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\nThis is a bill in equity, filed on the 16th of April, 1878, by two of the heirs at law and next of kin of William Russell, of St. Louis, against Thomas Allen, to establish a trust in favor of Russell\u2019s heirs at law and next of kin, and for an account.\nThe bill alleges that on the 19th of July, 1855, William Russell and John S. Horner executed four indentures of trust, by each of which Russell, in consideration of one dollar paid, \u201c and for divers other good and valuable considerations, but chiefly for the purpose of founding an institution for the education of youth in St. Louis County, Missouri,\u201d granted and conveyed to Horner, his executors and administrators or successors, in trust forever, certain lands and personal property in the State of Arkansas, to have and to hold the same unto him, his executors, administrators, and successors, in trust \u201c to and for the following uses and purposes, to wit, the said property is conveyed for the use and benefit of the Russell Institute of St. Louis, Missouri; \u201d and empowered and directed him and them to sell the same as soon as conveniently might be, and to account for and pay over the proceeds yearly or oftener, deducting the reasonable expenses of executing the trust, \u201c to Thomas Allen, President of the Board of Trustees of the said Russell Institute at St'. Louis, Missouri, and his receipt therefor shall be a full discharge of the said party of the second part for the amount so paid and the application thereof; \u201d and Horner\u2019s trust to be brought to a close and the net proceeds paid over as soon as conveniently might be, and if not concluded within ten years, the property remaining undisposed of to be sold by public auction and the proceeds paid over as before required. In each of the four indentures reference was made to the three others, and it was \u201c declared that all of said conveyances, including this, are made to one and the same person for one and the same use and purpose, and that the same are and are to be deemed and taken and accounted for as one trust, according to the conditions of the deeds respectively, it having been intended by said deeds and this present one to convey all of the remaining property of the said William Russell in the said State of Arkansas to the said party of the second part, to and for the use and benefit of the said Russell Institute of St. Louis, Missouri.\u201d After this clause, in one of the indentures, were added the words, \u201c represented by their president as aforesaid.\u201d Each indenture contained a covenant by Horner \u201c faithfully to perform the trust hereby created.\u201d\nThe bill further alleges that Horner, in the execution of his trust, has converted a large portion of the property into money, has paid over to Allen the sum of about $50,000, and has con-' veved and transferred to Allen the property remaining unsold, and that Allen holds and controls the whole fund, and has never applied to any court for aid in the disposition and application thereof, and has in no way used or recognized the fund as held by him in trust for the uses declared by Russell.\nThe bill further alleges that there was not at the time of the execution of the indentures aforesaid, nor before or since, any such educational institution as was referred to therein ; that at the time of such execution Russell was from paralysis infirm in body and weak in mind, and that, while he then manifestly proposed to found such an institution, yet in his increasing incapacity of body and mind during the short .period that interv\u00e9ned between that time and his death he failed to accomplish his philanthropic purpose; that he died in 1856, without ever having founded such an institution, or delegated to Horner or to Allen, or to any .other person or corporation, authority to organize a Russell Institute, and that 'no such authority has hitherto been exercised or claimed by any person or corporation, and there is and has been no donee capable of receiving, holding, and administering the trust fund created by the indentures ; that the beneficiaries'of the trust, so far as can be determined by the terms of the indentures, are uncertain and indefinite, and the trust is invalid, and, there being no debts outstanding against Russell\u2019s estate, the trust fund belongs to his next of kin.\nTo this bill Allen filed a general demurrer, which was sustained and the bill dismissed. 5 Dill. 235. The plaintiffs appealed to this court. Pending the appeal,. Allen has died, and his executors have been made parties in his stead.\nThe deeds of gift state that they are made \u201c chiefly for the purpose of founding an. institution for the .education of youth in St. Louis County, Missouri; \u201d they convey the property to Horner and his successors in trust \u201c for the use and benefit ,of the Russell Institute of St. Louis, Missouri; \u201d they direct him to sell the property and account for and pay over the proceeds \u201c to Thomas Allen, President of the Board of Trustees of the said Russell Institute of St. Louis, Missouri,\u201d whose receipt shall be a full discharge of Horner; and they end by declaring that all these conveyances shall be deemed, taken, and accounted for as one trust, and that it is the intention of the donor to convey the property included in all of them \u201c to and for the benefit of the said Eussell Institute of St. Louis, Missouri,\u201d to which one of the deeds adds, \u201c represented by their president as aforesaid1.\u201d \u2022\nThe d\u00f3nor thus clearly manifests his purpose to found an institution for the education of youth in St. Louis, to be called by his name; and he executes this purpose by conveying the property to Horner in trust, to hold and convert into money and pay that money to the officers of the institute when incorporated and a board of trustees appointed. The direction to pay the money to Allen, as president of the board of trustees, and the mention, at the close of one of the deeds, of the institute as' represented by its president as aforesaid, clearly show that the fund is not to be paid to Allen individually; and while they imply the donor\u2019s wish that Allen should be the first president of the board of trustees of the institute, they do not make his appointment to and acceptance of that office a condition of the validity of the gift or of the carrying out of the donor\u2019s charitable purpose. The terms of the deeds clearly show that the donor did not contemplate or intend doing any further act to perfect his gift. It is not pretended that the allegations in the bill as to his weakness of body and mind amount to an allegation of insanity, and they are irrelevant and immaterial.\nThe principal grounds upon which the plaintiffs seek to maintain their bill are that the deeds create a perpetuity; that the uses declared are not charitable ; and that, if the uses are charitable, there are no ascertained beneficiaries and no donee capable of assuming and administering\u2019the trust, and the uses are too indefinite to be specifically executed by a court of chancery. But these positions, as applied to the facts of the case, are inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the law. of charitable uses, as established by the decisions of this and other courts exercising the ordinai'y jurisdiction in equity.\nBy the law of England from before the Statute of 43 Eliz. c. 4, and by the law of this country at the present day (except in those States in which it has been .restricted by statute or judicial decision, as in Virginia, Maryland, and more recently in New York), trusts for public charitable purposes are upheld under circumstances under which private trusts would fail.' Being for objects of permanent interest and benefit to the public, they may be perpetual in their duration, and are not within the rule against perpetuities ; and the instruments creating them should be so construed as to give them effect if possible, and to carry out tbe general intention of the donor, when clearly manifested, even if the particular form or manner pointed out by him cannot be followed. They may, and indeed must, be for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons ; for if all the beneficiaries are personally designated, the trust lacks the essential element of indefiniteness, which is one characteristic of a legal charity. If the founder describes the general nature of the charitable trust, he may leave the details of its administration to be settled by trustees under the superintendence of a court of chancery; and an omission to name trustees, or the death \u2022 or declination of the trustees named, will not defeat the trust, but the court will appoint new trustees in their stead.\nThe previous adjudications of this court upon the subject of charitable uses go far towards determining the question presented in this case.. As the extent and effect of these adjudications have hardly been appreciated, it will be convenient to state the substance of them.\nThe case of Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. 1, in which a bequest by a citizen of Virginia \u201c to the Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia annually,\u201d as \u201c a perpetual fund for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination who shall appear promising for the ministry,\u201d was declared void, was decided upon an imperfect survey of the early English authorities, and upon the theory that the English law of charitable uses, which, it was admitted, would sustain the bequest, had its origin in the Statute of Elizabeth, which had been repealed in Virginia. That theory has since, upon a more thorough examination of the precedents, been clearly shown to be erroneous. Vidal v. Girard, 2 How. 127 ; Perin v. Carey, 24 id. 465; Ould v. Washington Hospitals 95 U. S. 303. And the only cases in which this court has followed the decision in Baptist Association v. Hart have, like it, arisen in the State' of Virginia, by the decisions of whose highest court charities,' except in certain cases specified by statute, are not upheld to any greater extent than' other trusts. Wheeler v. Smith, 9 How. 55; Kain v. Gribboney, 101 U. S. 362.\nIn Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. 566, the owners of a tract of land (afterwards part of Georgetown) laid it out as a town, and made and recorded a plan of it, marking one lot as \u201c for the Lutheran Church; \u201d and the Lutherans of the town, a voluntary society not incorporated, erected and used a building- upon this lot as a church for public worship, and fenced in and used the land as a church-yard, for the burial of others as well as of Lutherans, for fifty years. Upon these facts, it was held that the BilLox Rights of Maryland, affirming the validity of any sale, gift, lease, or devise of land, not exceeding, two acres, for a church' and burying ground, recognized, to this extent at least, the doctrine of charitable uses, under which no specific grantee or trustee was necessary; that this land had been dedicated to a charitable and pious use, beneficial to the inhabitants generally, which might at all times have been enforced through the intervention of the government' as parens patriae, by its Attorney-General or other law officer; and that a committee of the society might maintain a bill in equity to restrain by injunction- the heirs of the original owners from disturbing that use.\nIn Inglis v. Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. 99, a citizen of New York' devised land to the chancellor of the State, the mayor of the city, and others, designating them all by their official titles only, and to their respective successors,'in trust out of the rents and profits to build a hospital for aged, decrepit, and worn-out sailors, as soon as the trustees should judge that the proceeds would support fifty such sailors, and to maintain the hospital and support sailors therein forever; and further declared it to be his will and intention, that if this could not be legally done without an act of incorporation, the trustees should apply to the legislature for such an act, and that the property should at all events be forever appropriated to the above uses and purposes. An act incorporating the trustees was passed, and the hospital was established. A majority bf the court held that the trustees took personally and not in their official capacities, and that upon their incorporation the legal title vested by way of executory devise in the corporation as against the heirs at law; and the dissenting judges differed only as to the legal title, and not as to the validity of the charitable trust.'\nIn McDonogh v. Murdoch, 15 How. 367, a citizen of Louisiana, declaring his chief object to be the education of the poor of the cities of New Orleans and Baltimore, made a devise and bequest to the two cities, one half to each, the income to be applied by boards of managers, who should be appointed, by either city, but whose powers and duties he defined, and who should obtain acts of incorporation, if necessary, for the. education of the poor and other charitable purposes, in various ways specified. .And in case the two cities should combine together and knowingly and wilfully violate the conditions, then he gave the whole property to the States of Louisiana \u25a0 and Maryland, in equal halves, \u201c for the purpose of educating the poor of said States under such a general system of education as their respective legislatures shall-establish by law.\u201d The court held that the devise to the cities was valid, and that the testator\u2019s directions as to the management of the income \u201c must be regarded as subsidiary to the general objects of his will, and whether legal and practicable, or otherwise, can exert no influence over the question of its validity; \u201d and expressed the opinion that the failure of the devise to the cities would not have benefited the heirs at. law, for in that event the limitation over to the States of Louisiana, and Maryland would have been operative. 15 How. 404, 415.\nIn Fontain v. Ravenel, 17 id. 369, a testator, residing at the time of his death in Pennsylvania, appointed his wife and three others to be executors of his will, and authorized his executors Or the survivor of them, after the death of his wife, to dispose of the residue of his estate \u201c for the use of such charitable institutions in Pennsylvania or South Carolina as they or he may deem most - beneficial to mankind, and so that part of the colored population in each of the said States of Pennsylvania and South Carolina shall partake of the benefits thereof..\u201d In that case, the testator had no\u2019t himself\u2019defined the nature of the charitable uses, nor authorized any one but his executors to designate them; and the point decided was that, they having all died without doing so, the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Pennsylvania could not sustain a bill to establish them, filed by charitable institutions in Pennsylvania and South Carolina in the name of the administrator de bonis non and next of kin of the testator. The question there was, whether the authority of a court of chancery, under such circumstances, belonged to its ordinary- jurisdiction over trusts, or to its prerogative poWer under the sign .manual of the crown, which last has never been introduced into this country. See Boyle on Charities, 238, 239; Jackson v. Phillips, 14 Allen (Mass.), 539, 576, 588. No question of the validity of the gift as against the next of kin was presented; and even Chief Justice Taney, who, differing from the rest of. the court, alone asserted that \u201c if the .object to be benefited is so indefinite and so vaguely described that the bequest could not be supported in the case of an ordinary trust, it cannot be established in a court of the United States upon the ground that it is a charity,\u201d distinctly admitted that- a suit by an heir or representative of the testator to .recover property or money bequeathed to a charity could not be -m\u00e1int\u00e1ined in a court of the United States if the bequest was valid by the law of the State. 17 How. 395, 396. Accordingly, in Lorings v. Marsh, 6 Wall. 337, the court dismissed \u00e1 bill by the next of kin to set aside a bequest by a citizen of Massachusetts \u201cin trust for-the benefit of the poor,\u201d by means of such incorporated, charitable institutions as should be designated by three persons appointed by the trustees or their successors; such a bequest being valid under the law of Massachusetts as habitually administered in her courts.\nIn United States v. Fox, 94 U. S. 315, this court, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York in 52 N. Y. 530, held a devise of land in New York to the United States, for the purpose of assisting to discharge the debt contracted by the war for the suppression of the Rebellion, to be invalid, solely because-by the law of New York, as declared by recent decisions of the Court of Appeals, none but a natural person, or a corporation created by that State with authority to take ljgk' devise, could be a devisee of land in that State. Where not prohibited by statute, a devise or bequest for such a purpose is a good charitable gift. Nightingale v. Groulburn, 5 Hare, 484, and 2 Phillips, 594; Dickson v. United States, 125 Mass. 311.\nIn Ould v. Washington Hospital, 95 U. S. 303, a citizen of Washington devised land in the District of Columbia to two persons named, in' trust to hold it \u201c as and for a site for the erection of a hospital for foundlings,\u201d to be built by a corporation to be established by act of Congress and approved by the trustees' or their successors, and, upon such incorporation, to convey the land to the corporation in fee. It was contended for the heirs at law. that the devise was void, because it was to a corporation to be established in the future, and might not take effect within the rule against perpetuities, and because of the uncertainty of the \u2022 beneficiaries; .and reference was made to the Maryland Statute of Wills of 1798, still in force in the District of Columbia, providing that no will should \u201c be effectual to create any interest or perpetuity, or make any limitation, or appoint any uses, not now permitted by the Constitution or laws of the State,\u201d and to a series of decisions in Maryland, holding that the Statute of Elizabeth was not in force in that State, and that charitable uses were there governed by the same rules as private trusts. But those decisions having been made since the separation.^ of the District of Columbia fi\u2019om the State of Maryland, the court held that the case must be determined upon general principles of jurisprudence, and that the devise was valid.\nThe objection to the validity of the gift before us, as tending to create a perpetuity, is fully met by the cases of Inglis v. Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor, McDonogh v. Murdoch, and Ould v. Washington Hospital, above cited, which clearly show that a gift in trust for a charity not existing at the date of the gift, \u00e1,nd the beginning of whose existence is uncertain'; or which is to take effect upon a contingency that may possibly not happen within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards, is. valid, provided there is no gift of the property meanwhile to or for the benefit of any private corporation or person. Those cases are in accord with English decisions of the highest authority, of which it is sufficient to refer to the leading case of Downing College, reported under the name of Attorney-General v. Downing in Wilmot, 1 Dick. 414, and Ambler, 550, 571, and under tbe name of Attorney-General v. Bowyer in 3 Ves. 714, 5 id. 300, and 8 id. 256, and to the recent case of Chamberlayne v. Brockett, Law Rep. 8 Ch. 206. See also Sanderson v. White, 18 Pick. (Mass.) 328, 336 ; Odell v. Odell, 10 Allen (Mass.), 1.\nThat the gift is for a charitable use cannot be doubted. All gifts for the promotion of education are charitable, in the legal sense. The Smithsonian Institution owes its existence to a bequest of James Smithson, an Englishman, \u201cto the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\u201d See Acts of Congress of 1st July, 1836, c. 252; 10th August, 1846, c. 178. This was held by Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls, in United States v. Drummond, decided in 1838, to be a good charitable bequest. The decision on this point is not contained in the regular reports, but appears by the letters of Mr. Rush; then Minister to England (printed in the Documents relating to the Origin and History of. the Smithsonian Institution, published by the Institution in 1879), to have been made after full argument in behalf of the United States by Mr. Pemberton (afterwards Mr. Pemberton Leigh and Lord Kings-down), and on deliberate consideration by the Master of the Rolls. History of Smithsonian Institution, 15, 19, 20, 56, 58, 62. And it was cited as authoritative in Whicker v. Hume, 7 H. L. Cas. 124, 141, 155, in which the House of Lords held that a bequest in trust to be applied, in the discretion of the trustees, \u201c for the benefit and advancement and propagation of education and learning in every part of the world, as far as circumstances will permit,\u201d was a valid charitable bequest and not void for uncertainty.\n\u201c Schools of learning, free schools, and scholars in universities,\u201d are among the charities enumerated in the Statute of Elizabeth; and no trusts have been more constantly and uniformly upheld as charitable than those for the establishment or support of schools and colleges. Perry on Trusts, sect. 700. That the gift \u201c for the purpose of founding an institution for the education of youth in St. Louis County, Missouri,\u201d to be managed by a board of trustees, is sufficiently definite, is shown by the decisions of this court in Perin v. Carey, and Ould v. Washington Hospital, above cited, as well as by that of the House of Lords in Dundee Magistrates v. Morris, 3 Macq. 134.\nThe law of Missouri, as declared by the Supreme Court of that State, sustains the validity of thi's gift. In Chambers v. St. Louis, 29 Mo. 543, a devise and bequest to the city of St. Louis, in trust \u201c to be and constitute a fund to furnish relief to all poor emigrants and travellers coming to St. Louis on their way bona fide to settle in the West,\u201d which was objected to for indefiniteness in the object, as well as for want of capacity in the trustee to take, was held to be. valid. And in Schmidt v. Hess, 60 id. 591, a grant of a parcel of land to the Lutheran Church for a burial ground was held to be a valid charitable gift, which equity would execute by compelling a conveyance to the trustees of a church proved to be-the church intended by the testator, although it was not incorporated at the time of the gift. We have been referred to nothing having any tendency to show that the law of Arkansas, in which the lands granted lie, is different.\nThe money paid and the lands, conveyed by Horner to Allen stand charged in the hands of Allen and his executors with the same charitable trust to which they were subject in the hands of Horner.\nSteps to organize such an institution as is described in the deeds may be taken either by the Attorney-General or other public officer of the State, or by individuals. Whenever an institute for the education of youth in St. Louis shall have been incorporated and'shall claim-the property, it will then be a matter for judicial determination in the proper tribunal whether it meets the requirements of the gift. The only question now presented is of the validity .of the gift as against the donor\u2019s heirs at law and next of kin.\nDecree affirmed."},{"case_name":"Mary Ann Hesketh, appellant, v.

The testamentary provision thus put to the test is a charitable bequest, and the view which the counsel of the complainant pressed upon the court was, that such bequest is void, on the ground of its indefiniteness with respect to its objects.\nUpon recurring to the language of that portion of the will which is thus impugned, it will be found that the annual income of a certain fund, which is in the hands of certain trustees appointed by the testator, is to be employed by them for the relief of such of the most deserving poor of the city of Paterson as are not intemperate, lazy or immoral. The testator has not left his intention in any wise in doubt. His purpose is plainly charitable in the legal sense. He has constructed a trust to carry such purpose into effect, and the class of persons who are to be his beneficiaries is clearly defined. But the contention is, that the persons who from time to time are to compose this class of beneficiaries must be possessed of certain specified qualifications distinguishing them from their associates in poverty in the city of Paterson, and such qualifications are of a kind not easily ascertainable, and inasmuch as a power of such ascertainment is not by the will conferred upon any one, the gift cannot be applied to its objects, and is therefore void.\nThat a charitable use may be inefficacious on account of the indefiuiteness or unascertainability of its purposes or objects, is readily admitted. Nor is it denied that certain gifts of this kind which, under some circumstances, would be put into effect by force of the ancient English legal system, would, under like conditions, prove unavailing if brought sub judiae in this state. In England, the lord chancellor, in matters of this kind, transcends judicial methods, and will effectuate one of these bequests where the general purpose of the donor is charitable, although the par tieular purpose which has been designated by him has failed and no trust has been created; but this is by force of a prerogative derived from the king, who is said to possess it as parens patriae. And it is this latter extraordinary power which has been almost universally conceded not to belong to the courts of this country. But with the exception of this prerogative, I am not aware that the court of chancery of this state is devoid of any power which has ever been exerted by an English chancellor with respect to the construction, regulation or enforcement of devises or bequests to charitable uses.\nOur equitable system is a copy and counterpart of the English chancery, and does not differ from it except wherein it has been varied by positive law, ancient custom or by conditions of life plainly incompatible with its regulations. In the main, the equitable jurisdiction exercised in this state can be expressed, and can be expressed only, in the terms that define the boundaries of its archetype. Such is the admitted condition of all our superior tribunals, for their essential substance and qualities are derived to us, as a people, by descent, and do not exist by mere legislative sanction. Hence it would seem to follow, by irresistible inference, that whatever power touching charitable gifts was originally, as a purely judicial function, vested in the chancellor of England, is vested in the chancellor of this state, for there is no statutory law, as I think, nor custom, curtailing such power, nor is its exercise inconsistent, in any degree, with'our social or political situation. It is true that the English statute of charitable uses is not in force in this state, and, so far as such statute may be said to have enlarged the sphere of equitable jurisdiction over this subject \u2014 though the supposition seems to me unfounded\u2014 to that extent the judicial power of our chancery may be wanting. But the present occasion does not call for the consideration of the involved and much-contested question as to the effect o\u00ed this act over the equitable doctrine of charitable uses, for whether such enactment is to be regarded as having added something to the extent of the equitable cognizance over the subject, or, as Lords Hardwicke, Eldon, Redesdale and other chancellors declared, created no new jurisdiction, but merely provided a novel mode of proceeding in cases of the misappropriation of charitable funds, still it has been made certain by modern research that the primitive and inherent powers of a court of equity in this domain are mi generis and of a very extensive character, and, as has been above stated, whatever such original authority was, jt exists in full vigor in the hands of the chancellor of this state, and it is in accordance with this theory that the few judicial examinations of this subject which have taken place in our courts have been conducted. Thus in the case of The New York Annual Conference Ministers Mutual Assistance Society v. Executors of Clarkson, 4 Hal. Ch. 541, the bequest was in the following words:\n\u201c I give and bequeath unto tbe New York Methodist Conference Society, for the support of old, worn-out preachers, the sum of three thousand dollars.\u201d\nThe complainant in the case, and which was thus misdescribed in the will, was an incorporated body whose purpose was to raise funds for the relief of such of its members, who were all ministers and preachers of the gospel attached to and connected with the New York conference, as were in necessitous circumstances through age, disease or other natural infirmity, as also the needy wives and children, widows and orphans of its members. This bequest was sustained as a charity notwithstanding its beneficiaries were a sub-class of the beneficiaries of the corporation, which sub-class of necessity would have to be selected, and no express powers to make such selection had been given by the testator. A similar doctrine was enforced in McBride v. Elmer\u2019s Executors, 2 Hal. Ch. 107, which was decided in the year 1847. A fund of $1,000 was bequeathed to \u201c The Bridgeton Trustees for Eree Schools,\u201d the interest to be applied annually for ages, as far as might be practicable, for the tuition of poor children without regard to denomination or color, in the elements of English literature. In this case, likewise, there was a misnomer of the trustees, and there was no power in terms conferred to settle who came within the class appointed to take as beneficiaries, yet, nevertheless, the court, after a learned argument, sustained the testamentary disposition as a charitable use. The following are cases in which, in the court of chancery, similar views have been expressed and like judgments have been rendered: Magie v. German Evangelical Dutch Church, 2 Beas. 77; Mason v. Methodist Episcopal Church, 12 C. E. Gr. 47; Stevens v. Shippen, 1 Stew. Eq. 487. And that the peculiar doctrine of the English law relating to charitable uses, so far as the same rests on judicial functions, is plainly recognized and enforced in some measure by this court appears in the cases of De Camp v. Dobbins, 4 Stew. Eq. 671; Norris v. Thomson, 6 C. E. Gr. 489; Attorney-General v. Moore, 4 C. E. Gr. 503.\nThis being the condition of the judicial authority over this-subject in this state, it becomes at once evident that all but one of the decisions which are so numerous, and which are pressed upon the attention of this court in the brief of the counsel of the appellant, cannot be looked upon in the light of authorities. \"With the single exception just noted, and which is an adjudication which will be presently referred to more at large, the cases-in question are examples of gifts that might be devoted to purposes other than charitable uses, or are determinations of courts existing in jurisdictions in which the doctrine derived from English sources that regulates the subject of such charities, has no-place, and in which bequests for such objects are regarded as private trusts, and are construed and regulated on that basis. To the former of these two classes of cases the English cases which are cited appertain, for they are either private trusts, or, like the case of Norris v. Thomson\u2019s Executors, the bequests in question embrace a use other than a charitable one. It would serve no useful purpose to consider those references in detail. It is enough to say that they have been carefully examined, and that they are not pertinent oh the present inquiry. ,In the other class, decisions are cited rendered by the courts of Maryland, North Carolina,and New York; but inasmuch as in these states it has been declared that the rules to be applied in the construction and administration of trusts for charitable uses are, in their respective jurisdictions, the same as are the rules by which private trusts in favor of individuals are adjudged, they can have no influence on the judicial mind in this state, in which an entirely different system, as has been already stated, has always prevailed. But I have alluded to an exceptional case to be found among the citations of counsel of American cases, and that case is the decision in White v. Fisk, 22 Conn. 31. The bequest in that case was in these words :\n\u201cAny surplus income that may remain to the extent of \u00a71,000 per annum, I direct to be expended by my said trustees for the support of indigent, pious young men preparing for the ministry in New Haven.\u201d\nThe judgment was that the gift was void, as the objects of the benefaction were indefinite, and that no power was conferred on the trustees to make them definite by selection. This case is certainly in all respects much in point, and in the jurisdiction in which it occurred and was decided, the equitable rules which prevail with respect to this branch of jurisprudence, appear to be very similar to those that are in force in this state. But it seems to me very clear that the court, on the occasion in question, fell into error in the application of one of the principles belonging to the subject adjudged by it, and I therefore agree to the criticism of Mr. Perry, in his excellent treatise on Trusts, that this decision is not one that is likely to be followed.\nThe mistake referred to consists in the assumption after, apparently, but a slight consideration of the topic, that there was no power to select the objects of the charity lodged by the testator in the trustees, whereas, as I am constrained to think, in view of the very liberal rules of construction which have ahvays been declared to be applicable to occasions of this character, such power was clearly conferred upon such officers. In such matters the paramount business is to ascertain from the language of the will, as explained by the subjects to which it pertains, the purpose of the testator, and if such purpose be not illegal, and can be plainly ascertained, to carry it into effect. And it is to be remembered that it is the acknowledged doctrine that in all .matters of construction courts are bound to lean in favor of charity rather than against it. And, indeed, so far has this legal favoritism been carried that it has been for ages the settled rale in the English law, and has been in this country often regarded as the true principle, that when a gift has been placed in the hands of a trustee to promote a charity, and which, from the mutation of circumstances, had become incapable of fulfillment, such gift was to be applied by the courts, exercising a purely judicial authority, to some cognate object, on the ground that it was the presumed intent of the testator that the fund so set apart as a benefaction should not, in any event, return to his estate. The present case does not call for any opinion on the important question how far, in the application of simply judicial standards, the courts of this state would undertake to exercise the doctrine of ay pres by construction; the subject is referred to only for the purpose of exemplifying with what strength of favor charitable bequests are regarded by the courts. But without resorting to a method of interpretation which, until it liasreceived the sanction of the courts of this state, must be considered as of questionable validity, and following none but the ordinary guides in the construction of wills, I cannot doubt that the inevitable conclusion must be that the testamentary disposition in the case cited from the Connecticut reports, as well as the one now under consideration in this court, confers upon the trustees not only the power to distribute the funds confided to them, but, as a necessary incident to that function, also the right to select the beneficiaries. It is the ordinary doctrine that when an act is authorized to be done by a trustee or other agent, every authority requisite to the doing of such act is, by intendment of law, comprised in such grant of power. A common example of this rule is presented in cases in which a power of sale is given by a will without in terms specifying by whom it is to be exercised, but if the proceeds of the sale are directed to be distributed by an executor or trustee, in such instances it has been held in numerous decisions that such executor or trustee will take, by implication, the power of selling, unless some other intent is discoverable from the whole will. Newton v. Bennet, 1 Bro. C. C. 135; Bentham v. Wiltshire, 4 Madd. 44; Blatch v. Wilder, 1 Atk. 420.\nWhen, therefore, in the Connecticut case and in the present case, a power is conferred on the trustees to distribute the fund to members of a class, such members having certain qualifications, which can be ascertained only by the exercise of judgment and discretion, as the act of distribution cannot be performed except after such ascertainment of the particular beneficiaries, the principal power to distribute the moneys carries with it, on the ground of the principle just mentioned, the incidental and necessary power of selection. That such was the intent of the testator would seem to be plainly manifest from the nature of the thing, the doing of which he has directed. If a gift of a sum of money were given to a clergyman with directions to distribute it among the most worthy and needy of his flock, no one, it is presumed, would doubt that the power to select the objects of such beneficence was intended to be lodged in him who was to dispense the fund. In this example, as well as in these testamentary gifts, inasmuch as the power to select is an indispensable preliminary to the power to dispense, the natural and reasonable inference arises that when the latter is expressly given the former is impliedly given. As far as I have noticed, this has been, except in the case of White v. Fisk, the judicial deduction from similar premises.\nIn the case of Trustees of the Philadelphia Baptist Association v. Hart's Executor, 4 Wheat. 1, Chief-Justice Marshall appears to have had no doubt on this subject. The words of the will in that case were:\n\u201c What remains of my military certificates at the time of my decease, both principal and interest, I give and bequeath to the Baptist Association that for ordinary meets at Philadelphia, which I allow to be a perpetual fund for the education of youths in the Baptist denomination who shall appear promising for the ministry, always giving preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s family.\u201d\nIt is observable that here is no express authority to the designated association to make a selection of the beneficiaries entitled to take under this bequest, and yet the chief-justice drew the inference, apparently without the least hesitation, that such was the province of that body. The court in this case decided on grounds that have been much shaken, but with which at present we have no concern, that the association that was constituted the trustee being unincorporated could not stand in such capacity, and consequently the question whether the beneficiaries were, in the absence of such officers, sufficiently indicated, became important, and upon that subject the court said: \u201c This question will not admit of discussion. Those for whose ultimate benefit the legacy' was intended are to bo designated and selected by the trustees. It could not be intended for the education of all the youths of the Baptist denomination who were designed for the ministry, nor for those who were the descendants of the father, unless, in the opinion of the trustees, they should appear promising. These trustees being incapable of executing the trust, or even of taking it on themselves, the selection can never be made nor the persons designated who might take beneficially.\u201d In this case it will be observed that the fund was given to the association, without any expressed direction for it to distribute such fund or to select the beneficiaries, and yet, looking to the evident intention of the testator, both such powers were unhesitatingly gathered by intendment. To the same purport, and equally strong on the point, was the action of Lord Redesdale, in the case of Mahon v. Savage, 1 Sch. & Lef. 111, in which the bequest was of \u00a31,000, with the following directions:\n\u201cTo be distributed amongst his poor relations, or such other objects of charity as should be mentioned in his private instructions to his executors.\u201d\nThere were no such private instructions left by the testator, and there were over fifty poor relations. The chancellor, after remarking that the bequest was a charitable one, and that the objects meant were the testator\u2019s own relations, added: \u201c Here the testator\u2019s design was to give them as objects of charity, and not merely as relations, and I take it, the executors have a discretionary power of distribution, and need not include all the testator\u2019s poor relations.\u201d\nHere, again, there was nothing in the will from which the testator\u2019s intention to confer upon his executors the authority to select the beneficiaries except the authority given to them to distribute the fund, and yet this eminent judge thought that such intention was clear as a plain inference. These two cases put the matter, in my opinion, on a legal basis. The principle adopted by these great judges, if applied to the case now before the court, must obviously lead to an affirmance of the decree appealed from; for if we assume, as was done in the decisions just referred to, that the power to employ this charity involves the power of selecting the beneficiaries, the case is divested of every element of uncertainty. In view of the recognition of. such an hypothesis, the case will then present these simple characteristics: A bequest in trust to a charitable use, for distribution among a class of undesignated persons, with a power in the trustees to designate such persons. It is presumed that in such a posture of things no one will assert that the bequest is not to be sustained. The decree should be affirmed.\nDecree unanimously affirmed."},{"case_name":"Robert Coit, Administrator, vs. Mary E. Comstock and others","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/521079\/","date":"1884-01-17","court":"Connecticut Supreme Court","content":"Park, C. J.\nThe principal question in this case grows out of a devise and bequest in the will of the late Seth Smith, of New London, which is as follows: [Given in full in the statement of the ease, ante p. 353.]\nTwo questions are presented for the consideration and determination of this court regarding this bequest.\n1st. Are the beneficiaries described sufficiently to enable, a court of chancery to carry it into effect?\n2d. Is it obnoxious to our statute against perpetuities ?\nThe books are full of cases regarding the first question, \u25a0wherein charitable uses have been discussed for centuries, by all grades of courts, from the lowest to those of last resort in England and in this country, and it would be unprofitable and useless to consider more than a few of them, for conflicting opinions abound, so much so that we must come at last to our own adjudications upon the subject, and perhaps to some of those of our sister states, for aid in arriving at a decision of the question.\nThe intent of the testator to create a public charity for the benefit of the aged, respectable and indigent women of the city of New London, is fully and clearly expressed. There is no mistaking his object and purpose: and. his right to dispose of his property in the manner indicated cannot be questioned. Indeed it is said that gifts to public charity are highly favored by the law, and courts of chancery will uphold them if it can possibly be done. \u201c This is a charity, which a court of equity is bound to uphold if practicable,\u201d said Judge Foster, in White v. Howard, 38 Conn., 366. \u201c Charities are highly favored in law, and they have always received a more liberal construction than the law allows to gifts to individuals.\u201d 1 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7 1165. \u201c Courts look with favor upon charitable gifts, and take especial care to enforce them, and guard them from assault, and protect them from abuse.\u201d Perry on Trusts, 630. \u201c Gifts to charitable uses are highly favored in law, and will be most liberally construed in order to accomplish the intent of the donor; and trusts which cannot be supported in ordinary cases, will be established and carried into effect where it is to support a charitable use.\u201d Sanderson v. White, 18 Pick., 333. \u201c If it is once determined that the donor intends to\ncreate a public charity, very different rules from those which are applied in establishing private trusts will be applied, in order fco effect the intent of the testator and establish the charity.\u201d Perry on Trusts, 629.\nThe beneficiaries in public charities must necessarily be described in general terms. They are persons in most cases yet unborn, and particularization is out of question. Classes may be described, running down through all time, but individuals can only be designated as belonging to such classes. Testators, therefore, in their description of parties to be benefited by their public charities, must necessarily be confined to such terms as \u201cthe aged,\u201d \u201cthe indigent,\u201d \u201cthe sick,\u201d \u201cthe lame,\u201d \u201cthe infirm,\u201d \u201cthe destitute,\u201d of a certain class or of a certain territory. These terms have a customary and popular meaning, and the parties to whbm they apply are reasonably unmistakable, although the terms are indefinite to a certain extent. ' Our statute of charitable uses could find no better terms to define its meaning than the general phrases, \u201c ministry of the gospel, and relief of the poor.\u201d Judge Foster, in White v. Howard, (supra), says: \u201cAfter all, there is no more uncertainty here than there is in the statute of 1702. If this devise is void for uncertainty then this provision in the statute must be void for the same reason. We should hesitate to pronounce a decision declaring one of the clauses of this ancient statute void for uncertainty.\u201d Perry (on Trusts, p. 651,) says: \u201c In order that there may be a good trust for a charitable use there must always be some public benefit open to -an indefinite and vague number. That is, the persons to be benefited must be vague, uncertain and indefinite, until they are selected or appointed to be the particular beneficiaries for the time being.\u201d Judge Story in his work on Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 372, says: \u201c Courts of equity now, in most of the states, take jurisdiction in carrying into effect charitable bequests,- however general are the purposes and objects intended, if they are sufficiently certain to be intelligible.\u201d Indeed, the famous statute of 43 Elizabeth, in enumerating \u201cthe pious .and godly uses \u201d to which it applies, employs no more definite descriptions than the following \u2014 \u201crelief of the aged,\u201d \u201cthe maintainenee of sick and disabled soldiers and marines,\u201d \u201c the education and preferment of orphans,\u201d \u201c the marriage of poor maids,\u201d \u201cthe supportation of tradesmen and handicraftsmen,\u201d that of \u201cpersons decaj^ed,\u201d \u201cthe redemption of prisoners and captives.\u201d\nIt would be strange indeed, if the law should require a testator to be more particular in the description of the objects of his bounty in charitable bequests for the relief of such unfortunates, than are the terms of the statute itself which authorizes such bequests to be made.\nThe uncertainty that must exist in such cases is reduced to certainty if a definite class of beneficiaries is described and a mode is provided for the selection of the particular objects of the bounty. Id certum est quod cerium reddi potest. Judge Storks, in Brewster v. McCall\u2019s Devisees, 15 Conn., 292, says: \u2014 \u201c A devise is never to be construed as absolutely void but from necessity; if it be possible to reduce it to a certainty the devise is to be sustained.\u201d Judge Daggett said in Bull v. Bull, 8 Conn., 50: \u2014 \u201c If a rule is given by which the persons can be described, if not with entire certainty, yet sufficiently so to uphold the devise, and if it can by possibility be upheld, it can never be pronounced void.\u201d The court in Holmes v. Mead, 52 N. York, 322, said: \u2014 \u201cIt is not material that the legatees should be definitety ascertained and known at the date of the will, or aven at the death of the testator. It is sufficient if they are so described that they can be ascertained and known when the right to receive the legacy accrues.\u201d\nIn the ease at bar the beneficiaries of the testator\u2019s bounty are described as definitely as could be expected in a bequest Avhich rvas intended to be perpetual. Provision rvas made for the selection of the parties to be benefited from the class designated, by a corporation with sufficient by-laws and regulations for the purpose. This is equivalent to the appointment of trustees in perpetual succession to make the selection. Such being the case, we think that the best considered cases in this state and elsewhere sustain us in holding that this gift to public charity is valid, so far as the question we are now considering is concerned.\nWe will briefly consider a few of our own decisions on the subject. In the case of Bull v. Bull, (supra,) a remainder was bequeathed to executors, in trust for the most needy of the testacor\u2019s brothers and sisters, with express authority and power to the executors to make distribution to the most needy. The court say: \u2014 \u201cHere it can be ascertained who are the most needy of the brothers and sisters and their children. A rule is given by which the persons can be designated, if not with entire certainty, yet sufficiently so to uphold they devise.\u201d This was a private charity, where, it seems, the rule of certainty in the description of beneficiaries is more stringent than is required in public charities; still the description would seem to be as indefinite as in the case at bar. The case was saved by the power,given to the executors to make a selection, which \u2022 the law alone could never have done. It required judgment and discretion to ascertain the \u201c most needy.\u201d\nIn the case of Treat's Appeal from Probate, 30 Conn., 113, a devise was made to trustees for the promotion of education and science among the Indian and African youth of the United States and elsewhere, with full power in the trustees to make selections of beneficiaries from the class designated. The court say: \u2014 \u201cAs to the objects of the charity, what can be more unambiguous and certain ? The class is certain, and the individuals to be selected from the class may be made certain by the selection of the trustees.\u201d Here again the devise was saved bjr the power given to the trustees to make selections from the class designated. It might have been asked as cogently in that case as similar questions are asked in. this, what age is comprehended by the word \u201cyouth?\u201d what number of years and days does it include, so that if any addition be made, the party will pass beyond youth, and be of an age beyond the limits of the devise? So, again, up to what mixture of Indian or African blood with the blood of other races of men, will a person still retain the Indian or African, character or cease to belong to those races ? There would seem to be as much uncertainty here as in the words \u201c aged,\u201d \u201c indigent,\u201d \u201c respectable,\u201d Youth \u2014 aged J The one is in the early part of life, the other in the latter; where one ceases, or the other begins, is, manifestly, equally indefinite. In the case of White v. Fisk, 22 Conn., 31, a bequest -was made to trustees for the support of indigent pious young men preparing for the ministry in New Haven. The court held the bequest void on the ground that no power was conferred upon the trustees to make selections from the class described, and that the description of the beneficiaries was too indefinite without such power. The court say: \u2014 \u201c The difficulty of carrying this provision into effect is as great as if no trustee had been appointed; for no rule of determination, selection or appointment is furnished by the will, and no positive or discretionary power of determination bestowed. It has been suggested that the power of selecting the beneficiaries under this bequest, and of apportioning the sums of money annually to be disbursed among them, is in the trustees. We do not so understand it. Their only power is to expend the money \u2014 to pay it out to the persons entitled under the will to receive it. * * There is a class of cases, the authority of which we recognize, where the individual beneficiaries under a will, but included in a definite class, are left uncertain, and yet the bequest for their benefit has been sustained.' But these are cases where the gift has been to some corporate or voluntary association, whose business and duty it becomes to dispense the charity; or where power is very certainly conferred by the will upon the executor or trustee, to discriminate and select, or to apportion the application of the funds.\u201d Judge Ellsworth, in Treat's Appeal from Probate, (supra,) in commenting upon this cas\u00e9 says:\u2014 \u201c The testator had provided in his will no way of selecting the beneficiaries from a class, and the court held that they could not, even as a court of equity, do it for him. Had that \u2019 power been given to his executors or trustees, the clause in the will would have been sustained, and Judge Hitchcock would not have been disappointed in his benevolent purpose.\u201d The ease of White v. Fisk has been strenuously urged to show the bequest in question void, but instead of showing this, the case sustains the legality of the bequest. The uncertain words in that case were, .\u201cindigent,\u201d \u201c pious,\u201d \u201c young.\u201d In the case at bar, \u201c indigent,\u201d \u201c aged,\u201d \u201c respectable.\u201d The word \u201c indigent \u201d appears in both cases. Can any one say that the words, \u201caged,\u201d \u201crespectable,\u201d are more uncertain than the words, \u201cpious,\u201d \u201c young?\u201d Still it appears by Treat's Appeal from Probate that White v. Fisk would have been sustained if power of selection had been given to the trustees.\nThere are many cases elsewhere which maintain the same doctrine. Washburn v. Sewall, 9 Met., 280; Odell v. Odell, 10 Allen, 1; Saltonstall v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 446 ; Jackson v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 465; Fellows v. Miner, 119 Mass., 541.\n, Cases might be cited from other states to the same effect, but we think it unnecessary. We think the bequest is valid so far as this question is concerned.\nSome question has been made with regard to the meaning of the phrase \u201c have been residents of the city of New London.\u201d It is said that a will speaks from the death of the testator, and that the meaning of the phrase therefore is, have at that time been residents, &c. It is true that wills generally speak from the death of the testator, but there are many exceptions to the rule. The language of a will is to be construed according to the manifest intent of the testator as shown b}r the will. This bequest was intended to be perpetual. The corporation to hold the property during all coming time is burdened with the duty of making selections of beneficiaries from time to time, perpetually, and when selections shall be made, the parties selected shall then \u201c have been residents of the city of New London.\u201d This is the obvious meaning of the phrase.\n1 Some question has also been made in respect to the meaning of the word \u201chome,\u201d as used in the will. But we think it is equally clear what was the precise meaning the testator attached to the word. He was describing a house for the permanentresidence of the aged, indigent, respectable women of the'city of New London. Webster defines \u201c home \u201d to be \u201c a dwelling house ; the house where one resides; residence.\u201d Surely, there is no uncertainty in the will regarding the mean ing of the word.\nIs the bequest void by our statute against perpetuities ?,\n\u25a0 The property is bequeathed to the executors of the will in trust for the public charity therein created, \u201c until an act of incorporation can be obtained from the General Assembly of the state of Connecticut.\u201d\nIt is said that, should an act of incorporation never be obtained, the property would remain in the hands of the executors perpetually, and that consequently the bequest is obnoxious to the statute.\nIt is manifest from the will that the testator intended that the property should remain in the hands of his executors but a short period of time. The language of the will is, \u201c until an act of incorporation can be obtained.\u201d Clearly this act was to be procured as soon as it could be done. It is clear, therefore, that a reasonable time only for the act to be obtained was contemplated by the testator. But it is said that the state might refuse to grant the act. It is true that it may be within the limits of possibility that the sovereign power might refuse. And,so might the donee of a gift refuse to receive a benefaction tendered. The state was to a great extent to be benefited by this public charity, for many of its citizens, who in part make up the body-politic, were to be benefited through all coming time. It was scarcely possible, therefore, that the state would refuse such a benefaction tendered to its citizens, tendered in part to itself.\nIt is further said, that no one is charged with the duty of bringing the matter to the attention of the legislature and procuring the act of incorporation. We do not so understand the will. The executors were burdened with this duty. They were appointed to execute the will, and they accepted the trust. A part of its execution was to carry into effect this bequest, and they would have been recreant to their duty had they neglected or refused to execute this important part of their trust. Executors must pay legacies, and this was in the nature of a legacy to the \u201c aged, indigent, respectable women of New London.\u201d Their duty could not have been fulfilled until they had procured an act of incorporation, and transferred the property to the corporation when organized. Hence, the gift of the property to the executors was for them merely to hold for such a reasonable time as might be suffi cient for them to procure an act of incorporation from the legislature, and then transfer the property to the corporation as soon as it should become organized. Surely the will itself was not obnoxious to the statute. What would have become of the property if an act of incorporation had not been procured within such reasonable time, it is not necessary to consider.\nThere is another view of this question. The testator in this bequest declares his object and purpose to be the founding of a home for the aged, &e., which should endure forever. He realized that men must die, but corporations never die. He desired, therefore, to have the charity under the management and administration of a corporation that should endure as long as the home should exist. To carry out this object he gives the property to his executors, to be transferred to the corporation as soon as it should be chartered and organized. The instrumentality of the executors was employed merely to pass the title to the corporation. Nothing is said in the will as to the beneficial interest in the property becoming vested in the beneficiaries when the property should be conveyed to the corporation. It became vested in them on the death of the testator, liable to be devested if a corporation should not be organized within a reasonable time under all the circumstances. There is no room for claiming that the property did not vest till the conveyance should be made to the corporation. The charity could not be administered till then, but its administration had nothing to do witli the vesting of the property, any more than the possession of property by a devisee has to do with the vesting of the same in him. Reversionary interests vest in a party when the possession of the propertjr is in another. So here, the property became vested on the death of the testator, but the time when the beneficiaries should enjoy the charity was deferred till the corporation should become organized and the property conveyed.\nThere is nothing in either of these views of the question which conflicts with the case of Jocelyn v. Nott, 44 Conn., 55, which has been so strenuously claimed. In that case real estate was devised to trustees till some Congregational church, orthodox according to the.faith, order and discipline of the Congregational churches of Connecticut and connected with the General Association of the state, should become organized and should build a church edifice upon the land, for the worship of God according to the usages of such church, and till the trustees should become satisfied that the cost of the building had been paid, and the church and society were free from debt, and permanently established on the land; then the trustees were required to convey the property to the society. The court held the devise void by the statute against perpetuities.\nIt will be observed that there was no connection whatever between the trustees and any one of the Congregational churches of the state of the order described. They were to hold the property till some one of such churches should comply with the numerous conditions, which the court well said might never occur. The devise was a mere offer of the land, and the trustees were to wait and see-whether any one of the churches described would accept the proposition. Clearly, that case is not analogous to the one at bar.\nThe case of Ould v. Washington Hospital for Foundlings, 95 U. S. Reps., 303, is strikingly like the one under consideration. The devise was there made to trustees to hold the property till an act of incorporation should be passed by Congress, establishing a hospital for foundlings, and then convey the property to the corporation. Justice Swayne, in giving the opinion of the court, says: \u201cThe testator chose to reach the end in view by the intervention of trustees, and instructing them to convey at the proper time. This provision in the will was, therefore, a conditioned limitation of the estate vested in the trustees, and nothing more. Their conveyance was made necessary to pass the title. The duty with which they were charged was an executory trust. * * When such uses are consummated, and no longer in fieri, the law of perpetuity has no application.\u201d See also Inglis v. Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 3 Pet., 310.\nWe think the bequest is not obnoxious to the statute against perp\u00e9tuites.\nWe think the bequests to the ecclesiastical societies are void by the statute, on the ground that they create perpetuities. A sum of money was bequeathed to each erf'the societies described, to be invested as a perpetual fund; and the annual income thereof, or so much as should be necessary, applied in keeping in good order certain burial lots, and the remainder of the income, if any, applied to the maintenance of the religious services of the societies. The will then goes on to say that in case the societies should at any time fail to comply with these conditions, in keeping in good order the burial lots, the bequests should become void.\nIt has been held in numerous decisions, that bequests for the purpose of keeping burial lots or cemeteries in good order or repair, are not given in charity, and, therefore, are not protected by the statute of charitable uses.\nIf the sums of money had been bequeathed to the societies without condition, and the income thereof applied to the maintenance of the religious services of the societies generally, and one of their duties had been the keeping in good order burial lots or cemeteries, then the bequest would have been given to a charity, and would have been protected by the statute of charitable uses.\nBut the bequests as they are, although some portion of the income is to be devoted to a charitable purpose, cannot be supported. If it were otherwise it would be in the power of an individual to make a perpetuity of property to any extent, bjr devoting some small portion of the undivided income thereof to some charitable purpose. A little charity, in such a case, cannot preserve the entire bequest.\nNeither can the forfeiture clause protect the bequests. There might not be a forfeiture within a thousand years, and during all that time the property, devoted to keeping in order the burial lots, would be a perpetuity, contrary to' the statute.\nWe think the bequest to the Smith Memorial Home is' valid; but that the bequests to the ecclesiastical societies are invalid; 'and so we advise the Superior Court.\nIn this opinion Pardee and Loomis, Js., concurred.\nCarpenter, J. I think the legacies to the religious societies were good; and that the duty of keeping in order the lots in the cemetery does not make them void as contrary to the statute against perpetuities or otherwise.\nGranger, J., concurred in holding that -the legacies to the religious societies were void, but dissented as to other points in the opinion."},{"case_name":"Gravett vs. The State of Georgia","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/40586\/","date":"1884-11-11","court":"Supreme Court of Georgia","content":"Hall, Justice.\nThe bill of indictment charged the defendant with fraudulently leading, taking, carrying, decoying and enticing away the daughter of the prosecutor, a child under eighteen years of age, without the consent of her parents, and is substantially in the language of \u00a74368 of the Code.\nThe court charged the jury that kidnapping, under this section of the Code, was the forcible, malicious or fraudulent leading, taking or carrying away, or decoying or enticing away, any. child under the age of eighteen years from its parent or guardian, or against his, her or their will or wills, or without his, her or their consent or consents, and that if the state proved, beyond a 'reasonable doubt, that the defendant, in the county of Carroll, on the day named in the indictment, fraudulently took, led or carried away, or decoyed or enticed away, the daughter of the prosecutor, she being a child under-eighteen years of age, without the consent and against the will of her parent, that they might find him guilty; that the offense consisted in the purpose of the defendant to deprive the parent of his dominion, power, custody and control over his child, and to substitute his own power, custody and control over her for that of her father; that when this was done, the crime was complete; but .that it was incumbent upon the state to show all these material facts before a conviction could take place.\n\u25a0 To this charge the defendant excepted, and assigns as error that the offense is not complete, unless it was also alleged and proved that the child kidnapped was fraudulently enticed and decoyed away against her own will and without her consent, as well as that of her parent. Such, however, is not our apprehension of the scope and purpose of this statute. We agree with the view taken by the judge, and think that he rightly comprehended and expressed the object and intention of the legislature in its passage, when he charged the jury that the offense was complete if it was the purpose of the defendant fraudulently to deprive the parent, against his will and without his consent, of the dominion and custody of his child, and to substitute his own dominion, custody and control over the child for that.of the parent. The statute evidently provides for two cases \u2014 one is where the child kidnapped has a parent or guardian, and the other where it has neither; in the latter case, it must be forcibly, maliciously or fraudulently led, taken or carried or decoyed or enticed away against its own will and without its consent; in the former, if these things shall be done against the will and without the consent of the parent, irrespective of that of the child, this alone would complete the offense. The purpose of the statute is two-fold: its object is to protect not-only the rights of parents and guardians, but also those of children. It could never have been the intention of the lawmakers to leave unprotected and uncared for helpless children, who had been deprived of their natural protectors, and those for whom none had been provided by the tribunals of the country. The state is emphatically parens patriae, and owes protection to all its citizens, adults and minors. It is charged with the duty of providing safe-guards for their rights, both absolute and relative, as well such as are inborn and natural as those conferred by society. The rights of personal liberty and personal security belong to all manRjnd, and the obligation to preserve them from invasion, or if invaded to afford redress for the wrong, is of the highest and most imperative character. Minor' children have rights, whether they have parents or guardians or not. Society itself has an interest in the prosperity of all its members, and it is incumbent upon the legislature to make provision for preserving its good order, peace and security, arid when an act is passed for this object, and is susceptible of a construction that completely attains it, the manifest duty of the courts is to give it that construction, rather than one which would exclude from its operation a portion of the cases essential to its complete aim and object. Effect should be given to each and all its parts and to every word in it, and this is effected by the interpretation adopted by the court in this instance. While the provision in question is not marked by that clearness and precision of language which characterizes the penal Code of 1833, from which it is taken, yet it is sufficiently definite to leave no doubt either of the purpose of its enactment or of the cases it was designed to embrace.\nThe jury had been out for some hours deliberating upon the case, without reaching a conclusion, and the court \u25a0 directed an inquiry to be made whether they had agreed \u2022upon a verdict, or were likely to agree, to which they \u2022 replied they had not, and asked to be re-charged. They were brought into court and asked upon what they desired to be re-charged, and in response stated, through their foreman, they wished to be charged again upon the law \u2022 of the case; the judge complied with this request by repeating to them the charge previously given them, which has been already set forth. They were then asked if they desired to be charged on any other point, to which the foreman replied, that some of them contended that they must believe all the allegations before they could find the defendant guilty, to which the court responded, \u201c I have so charged you. You must believe that the defendant did fraudulently lead, take or carry away, or decoy^r entice :away, Euphrasia Noles \u201d (the prosecutor\u2019s minor child), \u201c and that it was done against the will and without the consent of her father, otherwise you should acquit the defendant;\u201d and not desiring further instructions, they were directed to return to their room and make a verdict, and immediately after their return, they agreed and brought in a verdict finding the defendant guilty. The defendant and his counsel were in court when this occurred; they made no objection to anything that was dono; they did not, as they might have done, request additional instructions upon any of the questions on which the jury desired to be re-charged; in short, by their silence and inaction, they acquiesced in what was said and done. It is now asserted that the judge erred in this additional charge, because it impressed upon the minds of the jury the position of the state\u2019s counsel, and did not again set forth the grounds of the defence, as had been done in the original charge. Without reference to any other question, we do not agree to what is assumed in the groundwork of this objection. This charge was as favorable to the defendant as to the state, and did cover the theory, both of the defence and prosecution, as fully as did the original charge. We do not understand that, when instructions are asked upon particular questions, it is the duty of the court to repeat its entire charge as previously given. Such a practice might lead to confusion, and would certainly protract proceedings needlessly. All' that is necessary is that the charge should fully present both aspects of the case, and \u201c should call the attention of the jury to that view of the facts consistent with innocence, as well as the one suggesting guilt.\u201d 34 Ga., 407.\nIt was certainly competent to show that the prosecutor was unwilling that his minor child should be taken, carried or decoyed away, and any efforts that he made or precautions that he took to prevent it, \u2014 as the nailing up the window to her room, \u2014 were admissible in evidence to establish this fact. If it had been essential, that knowl- - edge of this fact should be brought home to the defendant, in order to fix his guilt; what occurred immediately after the flight of the child from the father clearly shows that he had knowledge of the father\u2019s aversion to the .deed, and authorized the inference that the departure was the result of a previous understanding between her and him; for, when she left, he was in the vicinity, and she went immediately to him; instant pursuit was made, and he helped her off; he even fired a pistol at one of the family engaged in the pursuit; he carried her to the house of his kinsman, where she was lodged and harbored during the night; he appeared there early the next morning and carried her away; and although he was a married man, seeking a divorce from his lawful wife, he avowed his purpose to procure a license and marry her. It is true that on that day he accompanied her to the vicinity of her brother\u2019s house, and while he remained at a convenient distance, sent her into the house, but she went there for the purpose of procuring assistance to enable her to get her clothing from her father\u2019s; that she failed in the object of this visit, and afterwards met him where he had been left; on her return to him, she was accompanied by her sister and sister-in-law, and by their persuasion she was permitted to return to the house with them, where she remained secreted for a portion of two days, when she left on hearing repeated reports of a pistol, which she declared was the signal for meeting agreed on between them; from that time she was lost sight of by the family until her dead body was found, six iqonths afterwards, in the river. The crime was complete on the day of her flight, and nothing that occurred afterwards had the slightest tendency to weaken these strong proofs of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Besides, it was not essential to the guilt of the defendant that he should have been notified of the father\u2019s unwillingness to relinquish his dominion over his child, and of all the circumstances that tended to demonstrate his purpose. The father was not bound to declare to him his apprehensions and to require him to desist; he was under no obligation to remonstrate with him, that he might arrest the commission of the offense which he feared he contemplated. Such a course might have tended to precipitate the catastrophe he was anxious to avert.\nThe libel for divorce was admissible as a circumstance to corroborate and strengthen the proofs of the state; the fact that it established beyond controversy was already in evidence on the part of the defendant; and had it been objectionable for other reasons, which were not suggested and which do not occur to us, still we are at a loss to see what injury it could have done the defendant.\nThere was no error in excluding evidence of the prose, cutor\u2019s harsh treatment of his family; whether he treated them kindly or otherwise was no concern of the defendant; certainly he was not responsible to the defendant for any shortcoming in this respect; and although he was amenable to the courts for this violation of his social duty, yet this did not justify the violent interference of the defendant, and excuse his open disregard of parental authority, by fraudulenly enticing and carrying off this girl. But even if this testimony, as was insisted, tended to show that the departure of this unfortunate child from her father was her own unaided act, and repelled, in a measure, the defendant\u2019s participation in her flight, yet he had the full benefit of it, for, at a subsequent stage of the case, the matter was gone into fully, and the result of the investigation was a complete vindication of the father's conduct. The allegation was shown to be groundless; the defendant was not therefore injured by its rejection when it was first offered.\nWhen Sarah Noles, a female witness on the stand, was asked if she did not have children, she replied she had one child, but manifested resentment at the question, and an evident reluctance to answer. She was then asked if she had ever been married. \u2014 Objection was made to this question by the state\u2019s counsel, and in reply to the objection, the court stated that the witness need not answer the question. She declined to make answer, and the court ruled out the answer to the former question. Objection is made by the defendant to this ruling. There could have been but one purpose in offering this evidence, and that was to impair the force of the witness\u2019s testimony; in other words, to discredit and impeach it. It is not denied that a witness, fully apprised of his rights in this respect, may voluntarily answer questions tending to degrade or criminate him; but no such question seems to have been made or passed upon by the court below. It is equally undeniable, however, that he is not required to testify to any matter which may criminate or tend to criminate him, or which shall have a tendency to bring infamy or disgrace, or public contempt upon himself or any member of his family.

Our court has upheld this right with a steady hand, and has never suffered it to be impaired, or trenched upon, by evasion or in any other manner. In this respect, it has never allowed a witness to be entrapped or imposed upon. It has made it the imperative duty of the judge to see that he is not circumvented, going so far as to declare that the party himself cannot \u201c even waive this protection, for the law is, in this regard, his guardian.\u201d 14 Ga., 258. This case does not require us to go to the extreme length laid down by that last cited, and it is proper to say that, without qualification, we cannot give our sanction to the doctrine there announced; indeed, we think that its latitude is not warranted by the case of Lee vs. Read, 5 Beavan, 381, 385, relied on to support it. All that was held by the master of the rolls in that case was, that a party, by a previous covenant to answer a bill within a given time, did not thereby waive the protection that the law gave him from disclosing matter that might tend to criminate him; that, notwithstanding such agreement, he might protect himself by demurrer, plea or answer, or in any way in which he could bring the matter fairly under the consideration of the court. As thus qualified, the principle announced, we think, is sound, and fully sustains the action of the court in the present case.\nA careful consideration of this record satisfies us that the verdict is not only fully sustained, but is required by the evidence. It would be difficult to make out a case less open to doubt.\nJudgment affirmed."},{"case_name":"State (ex rel. Cunningham) v. Ray","url":"https:\/\/api.case.law\/v1\/cases\/1808050\/","date":"1885-06-01","court":"New Hampshire Supreme Court","content":"Smith, J.\n\u201cWhen any minor under the age of seventeen years, charged with any offence punishable by imprisonment otherwise than for life, shall be convicted and sentenced accordingly, or shall be ordered to recognize for his appearance at the supreme court, the court or justice, upon application of such minor, his friends, or the state\u2019s counsel, may order, that instead of such imprisonment or recognizance the said minor may be sent and kept employed and instructed at the reform school for such term, not less than one year nor extending beyond the age of twenty-one years, as said court shall judge most for his true interest and benefit, provided he shall conduct himself according to the regulations of said school, and a copy of such order shall be sufficient authority for his commitment and detention at such school.\u201d G. L., c. 287, s 14. By c. 37, Laws 1881, the name of the institution was changed to the industrial school. Under the authority of this statute, the relator\u2019s minor sons, one of the age of thirteen and the other of the age of sixteen years, have been sent to the industrial school for the terms of three and two years respectively, neither having been convicted of any crime or offence. They were brought before a justice of the peace upon a complaint charging them with having committed the crime of burglary, a crime of the gravest character, and punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a long term of years. The crime was one which the magistrate had not jurisdiction to determine, but.only to inquire if just cause appeared to hold the accused to answer at the supreme court. They were heard upon no other charge than that set out in the complaint, and were not in law required to defend against any other. An order was made requiring them to recognize for their appearance before the supreme court. So far the justice had jurisdiction. At this stage of the proceedings, the counsel for the state moved for an order that the accused be sent to the industrial school, and the justice, declining the offer of the accused to recognize agreeably to the order then just made by him, issued an order committing them to the school for the terms above mentioned. The commitment was not for the purpose of securing their appearance at the supreme court, for the shortest term for which they might be sent to the school would extend much beyond the next term of the supreme court. If they were committed as a punishment for having committed the crime of burglary, they have never been tried or convicted of that crime by the judgment of their peers. Article 15 of the bill of rights provides that \u201cno subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.\u201d This clause in our constitution is a translation from Magna Charta, and dates from 1215. Its meaning has become fixed and well determined, \u201c and asserts the right of every citizen to be secure from all arrests not warranted by law.\u201d Mayo v. Wilson, 1 N. H. 53, 57. It guarantees the right of trial by jury in all cases where the right existed at common law in this state at the adoption of the constitution. That a person charged with having committed the crime of burglary is entitled to a jury trial, has never been questioned. As the justice only had jurisdiction to inquire and not to convict, the accused have had no trial. Provision is, and ever since the adoption of the constitution has been, made by statute for a trial by jury of every crime indictable by a grand jury, and of every offence where an appeal is taken from the judgment of a justice or police court. Final judgment cannot be enforced for the commission of any police offence, however trivial, until the appellant has been convicted by a jury of his peers. If the relator\u2019s sons were sent to the industrial school for some other crime or offence, it was one of which they have never been convicted, and in violation of art. 15 of the bill of rights, which provides that \u201cNo subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him, or be compelled to accuse or furnish evidence against himself. And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs that may be favorable to himself, to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by himself and counsel.\u201d\nBut the commitment and detention of the relator\u2019s sons is justified by the respondent upon the ground that the industrial school is not a prison, that the order of commitment was not a sentence, and that their detention is not a punishment. The contention is, that the industrial school is a part of the school system of the state, and that the state as parens patriae may detain in the school such scholars as may need its discipline. If it is a privilege to be admitted a member of the school, it is a privilege limited to \u201c offenders against the laws.\u201d At no time since its institution in 1855 have its doors been open to the admission of any other class of scholars. Its advantages have not been offered to every minor under the age of seventeen years who might desire to enter, or whose parents or guardian might seek to place him there.\nThe relator\u2019s sons were sent to the school, either because they had committed some crime or offence, or because the justice judged it to be for their \u201c interest and benefit \u201d to be placed there. For whichever of these causes they were committed, the commitment was illegal. As already remarked, they have never been convicted of the crime of burglary; and they have not been tried or had any opportunity to defend against any. other charge. If the order for their commitment was made because the justice judged it to be . for their \u201c interest and benefit,\u201d the answer is, that he had no authority by statute to'commit them for that cause. Whenever a court or a justice may send a minor to the school, he may fix the term during which he may be kept at. the school at not less than one year nor extending beyond the age of twenty-one years, as the court or justice \u201cshall judge most for his true interest and benefit.\u201d The limit of his stay or confinement in the school is determined by the consideration of what shall be \u201c most for his true interest and benefit;\u201d but the statute does not confer upon the court or justice the power to send a minor to the school solely for the reason that the court or justice may be of opinion that it may be for the interest or benefit of the minor to be sent there.\nThe original name of the school \u2014 \u201c House of reformation for juvenile and female offenders against the laws \u201d (Laws 1855, e. 1660) \u2014 indicated the character of the institution. The act provided that any boy under the age of eighteen years, or any female of any age, \u201c convicted of any offence known to the laws of this state and punishable by imprisonment other than such as may be punished by imprisonment for life,\u201d might be sentenced to the house of reformation. Ib., s. 4. At no period in its history could a person become an inmate of the institution, unless, being within the prescribed age, he or she had been convicted of a crime or offence. The only exception is the unconstitutional provision inserted in the revision of 1867 (Gen. Sts., c. 269, s. 14, G. L., c. 287, s. 14), authorizing a justice to send to the school a minor less than seventeen years of age whom he shall have ordered to recognize for his appearance at the supreme court. We cannot ignore the fact that in the public estimation the school has always been regarded as a quasi penal institution, and the detention of its inmates or scholars as involuntary and constrained. The great purpose of the institution was, the separation of youthful offenders from hardened criminals of mature years, in the hope of their ultimate reformation and of their becoming useful citizens. But the fact cannot be overlooked, that' the detention of the inmates is regarded to some extent in the nature of a punishment, with more or less of disgrace attached on that account. If the order committing a minor to the school is not a sentence but the substitute for a sentence, as claimed by the respondent, what is a substitute for a sentence but a sentence in and of itself ?\nIt is worthy of remark, that the legislature has not undertaken to authorize the commitment of a minor to the industrial school upon the mere presentment of the grand jury.\nIn this case, the relator, the natural guardian of his sons, has been deprived of their care, nurture, education, and custody, against his consent, and without any trial or hearing to which he was a party, upon the ground, and only ground, that the justice found there was just cause to require them to appear at the supreme court to answer further. If he is not a suitable person to have the care and education of his children, that fact has not been found, nor does it appear that their education has been neglected. But how far he is entitled to be heard upon that question we do not decide. We have only alluded to the matter as showing what consequences may flow from the unlawful commitment of a minor to this school. Where the commitment is lawful, the loss by the parent of the custody of his child follows as one of the incidents for which there is no remedy, and perhaps in many instances, because of his unfitness, there ought to be none.\nIt is further deserving of consideration, that the relator\u2019s sons, if indicted for the crime of which they were charged before the justice, cannot plead autrefois convict, although they may remain at the school the full term for which they were sentenced: and if their detention at the school is a punishment, they are liable to be punished twice for the same offence, in violation of the fundamental maxim, \u201c nemo debet bis puniri,\u201d &c. Broom Leg. Max. 348.\nIn coming to this conclusion we have not overlooked the decisions in other states. Milwaukee Industrial School v. Supervisors Milwaukee County, 40 Wis. 328\u2014S. C., 22 Am. R. 702; McLean County v. Humphreys, 104 Ill. 378; Petition of Ferrier, 103 Ill. 367\u2014S. C., 42 Am. R. 10; Roth and Boyle v. House of Refuge, 31 Md. 329; Ex parte Crouse, 4 Whart. (Penn.) 9. In these cases the detention of abandoned, dependent, or depraved children in houses of refuge, or in industrial or reform schools, is upheld upon the ground that the power of magistrates and county courts to commit, and of such institutions to detain, such children, is \u201c of the same character of the jurisdiction exercised by the court of chancery over the persons and property of infants, having foundation in the prerogative of the crown, flowing from its general power and duty as parens patrice to protect those who have no other lawful protector \u2014 2 Story Eq. Jur., s. 1333\u201d (Sheldon, J., in Petition of Perrier, supra); or, as stated in Mx parte Crouse, supra, \u201cMay not the natural parents, when unequal to the task of education, or unworthy of it, be superseded by the parens patriae, or common guardian of the community?\u201d As to the soundness of the reasons given in these cases we have nothing to say. No one of them is an authority for the commitment of a minor charged with the commission of a crime to such an institution, without some kind of a trial and conviction.\nThe People v. Turner, 55 Ill. 280, S. C., 8 Am. R. 645, was an-application by the father for a writ of habeas corpus for the discharge from a reform school of his minor son. A statute of Illinois authorized the commitment to a reform school of children between six and sixteen years of age who are \u201cvagrants, or destitute of proper parental care, or are growing up in mendicancy, idleness, or vice, to remain until reformed, or until the age of twenty-one years.\u201d The relator\u2019s son, committed to the school under this statute, was discharged, the commitment being held not to have been for any criminal offence, and the statute was declared unconstitutional. His confinement was held to be imprisonment without due process of law. Thornton, J, said, \u2014 \u201cSuch a restraint upon natural liberty is tyranny and oppression. * * * If a father confined or imprisoned his child for one year, the majesty of the law would frown upon the unnatural act, and every tender mother and kind father would rise up in arms against such monstrous inhumanity. Can the state, as parens patriae, excede the power of the natural parent, except in punishing crime ?\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Horregan, 127 Mass. 450, it was held that certain statutes relating to juvenile offenders, so far as they purport to give inferior tribunals jurisdiction of offences punishable by infamous punishment, are unconstitutional.\nA statute of Ohio authorized the grand jury, where a minor under the age of sixteen years, is charged with crime, and the chai\u2019ge appears to be supported by evidence sufficient to put the accused upon trial, instead of finding an indictment, to return to the court that the accused is a suitable person to be committed to the house of refuge, and directed the court thereupon to order his .commitment without trial by jury. The statute was declared constitutional. Prescott v. The State, 19 Ohio St. 184\u2014S. C., 2 Am. R. 888. The decision is put upon the ground that the case \u201c is neither a criminal prosecution, nor a proceeding according to the course of the common law, in which the right to a trial by jury is guaranteed. The proceeding is purely statutory; and the commitment, in cases like the present, is not designed as a punishment for crime, but to place minors, of the description and for the causes specified in the statute, under the guardianship of the public authorities named, for proper care and discipline, until they are reformed, or arrive at the age of majority. The institution to which they are committed is a school, not a prison, nor is the character of their detention affected by the fact that it is also a place where juvenile convicts may be sent, who would otherwise be condemned to confinement in the common jail or the penitentiary.\u201d The statute further provided, that in case the cause for the child\u2019s detention shall be inquired into by a proceeding in habeas corpus, it shall be a sufficient return to the writ that he was committed to the guardianship of the directors of the school, and that the period for his discharge had not arrived. It is intimated in the opinion of the court that it is questionable whether this provision can operate to restrict the power of the court, invested by the constitution with jurisdiction in habeas corpus, from inquiring fully into the cause of the detention of a person restrained of his liberty.\nWith due respect for the learned court who pronounced this opinion, we are not convinced of the soundness of its reasoning or conclusion. The proceedings by which the accused was adjudged a suitable person to be committed to the house of refuge were conducted in secret, without his knowledge or consent, or that of his parent or guardian, with no opportunity to be represented by counsel, to be confronted with and cross-examine the witnesses for the prosecution, or to produce witnesses in his own behalf. The liberty of the minor during the term of his minority, which might be for a period of many years, was made to depend upon the deliberations of a secret tribunal. A judgment rendered upon such an ex parle hearing is as little calculated to command the respect of the community as the proceedings of the ancient court of star chamber. And so far as the other cases cited are like the Ohio case in legal effect, we cannot follow them.\nWhether what has been called a trial in other jurisdictions in cases of this class is a trial within the meaning of our constitution, and whether, on any ground than that of a charge of crime, the legislature can authorize minors or persons of age to be committed to the industrial school without a trial by jury, if it were claimed, and without the consent of parent or other guardian, are questions on which we give no opinion.\nPersons poor and standing in need of relief may and must be cared for By the overseers of the poor, and may be sent to the almshouse for support, but their detention cannot be regarded as involuntary. They are in no sense deprived of their liberty without the judgment of their peers or against the law of the land. They are neither criminals nor charged with the commission of crime, and this provision of the constitution was not understood by its framers as restricting the power of the legislature to provide for the relief of the worthy poor. So children of profligate parents, or with vicious surroundings, may be taken from the custody of their natural guardians and committed to the guardianship of those who will properly care for their moral, intellectual, and physical welfare. Prime v. Foote, ante 52. But this is a power exercised by the state as parens patriae in the welfare and interest of its citizens. 2 Stor. Eq. Jur., s. 1333.\nThe c\u00f3mmon-law principle of reasonable necessity has an extensive constitutional operation .(Aldrich v. Wright, 53 N. H. 398, 399, 400, Haley v. Colcord, 59 N. H. 7, 8, Hopkins v. Dickson, 59 N. H. 235, Johnson v. Perry, 56 Vt. 703, State v. Morgan, 59 N. H. 322, 325), and in many cases authorizes the restraint of an insane person (Colby v. Jackson, 12 N. H. 526, Davis v. Merrill, 47 N. H. 208, O'Connor v. Bucklin, 59 N. H. 589, 591, Keleher v. Putnam, 60 N. H. 30, Hinchman v. Richie, Bright. (Penn.) 143; Fletcher v. Fletcher, 1 E. & E. 420, Buswell on Insanity, ss. 19-24), even when he is committed to an asylum upon a defective process. Shuttleworth's Case, 9 Ad. & E. N. S. 651. But a magistrate\u2019s power to commit to the industrial school, for detention during minority, every person under the age of seventeen years charged with but not convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment otherwise than for life, on the ground of the \u201c true interest and benefit\u201d of the accused, does not come within any constitutional idea of reasonable necessity that has prevailed in this state.. For his interest and benefit the magistrate might as well be authorized to send him to the state prison as to the industrial school, or any other penal institution.\nWe are of opinion that so much of s. 14, c. 287, Gen. Laws, as authorizes a justice of the peace to commit to the industrial school a minor under the age of seventeen years, upon a complaint charging him with the commission of a crime of which the justice has jurisdiction only to require him to recognize for his appearance at the supreme court, on the motion of the state\u2019s attorney and without the consent of any person authorized to bind the minor by consent, is in violation of article 15 of the bill of rights.\nExceptions overruled.\nBlodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred."}]
